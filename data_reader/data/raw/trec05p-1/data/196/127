Happy New Year from Excelergy!
 

We're writing to keep updated on significant news detailing Excelergy's expanding corporate growth and success. Following a record-setting 2001, Excelergy has continued its strong momentum in 2002 with the signing of two major agreements. 

FIRST MEDIA/COMMUNICATIONS CLIENT 
  <http://www.excelergy.com/images/spacer.gif>
In an extraordinary validation of the flexibility, scalability and speed of Excelergy's products, Virginia-based S² Entertainment, a broadband video and interactive service provider, officially joined the growing Excelergy client family. In partnership with systems integrator Xperts Inc., Excelergy continues to expand its market reach.

While our bedrock vertical will always remain the energy/utility industry, we've now made our first mark in another exciting market! 

JOINS MICROSOFT TO DELIVER GROUNDBREAKING WEB SERVICES 
  <http://www.excelergy.com/images/spacer.gif>
Excelergy is combining key elements of its open, componentized, native XML technology platform with the Microsoft .NET application development platform, delivering the most advanced Web services available in the energy/utility industry. 

                          <http://www.excelergy.com/images/purple_arrow.gif>  www.excelergy.com/news/jan09-02.html <http://www.excelergy.com/news/jan09-02.html> 

Though this industry trend is just now being recognized by other companies, Excelergy's products have been delivering XML Web services to our clients for more than two years. Recently, Microsoft has established leadership among its competitors in this area, and our common view strengthens our relationship. 

CEO BILL MAHONEY IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
  <http://www.excelergy.com/images/spacer.gif>
Both of these announcements position Excelergy as consistently "ahead of the curve" in delivering the most advanced products and technology to restructuring markets. This kind of leadership is why CEO Bill Mahoney was recently called on byThe Boston Globe  to give his "front row look" at major issues facing companies in the energy industry.

Stay connected with us as we have more exciting news planned for the coming weeks. The week of January 22 we'll be announcing details about our record-setting 2001. Until then, we wish you an enjoyable and prosperous 2002!
