Would you guys be available this afternoon at 3pm to meet with myself and Chris Hilgert, in regards to emissions and compression services opportunities?

A copy of a presentation further detailing compressor sites and their applicable surroundings in Houston-Galveston, New Jersey, Arizona and the Chicago area is rather large (45 MB) and cannot be emailed. I put it in the directory O:/dropbox/compression services.

Regards,

Ben
