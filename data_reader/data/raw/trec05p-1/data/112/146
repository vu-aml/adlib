The new Bob Hillman CD, Welcome to My Century, is now available on-line at
www.bobhillman.net <http://www.bobhillman.net/> .

More than two years in the making, Welcome to My Century contains the
concert favorites “Valentine’s Day,” “Las Vegas,” “Greenland,” “The
Latenight,” and “Bolted Down,” and features some of New York City’s finest
musicians, including guitarist Dave Schramm, who has worked with Freedy
Johnston, Richard Buckner, Yo La Tengo, and the Replacements.  Producer
Tommy West, who produced and played piano on all of Jim Croce’s recordings,
adds vocal harmonies and keyboards.

Bob won the songwriting contests at the 2001 Sisters Folk Festival and at
the 1999 Tucson Folk Festival.  He is a four-time finalist in the Telluride
Troubadour Contest at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, and has twice been
selected for the New Folks Showcase at the Rocky Mountain Folks Festival.
