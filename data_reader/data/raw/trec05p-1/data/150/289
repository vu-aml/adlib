***********************************************************************

Dear Mexico Gas and Power Client,

As you might be aware, Pemex is proposing a new type of service contract as a 
way to increase E&P investment in nonassociated gas in the Burgos basin. 
Originally, CERA was planning to have a luncheon in December to discuss the 
current status of these integrated contracts. Our intention was to invite key 
individuals from Pemex to discuss the proposed contracts with our clients. 
Pemex has informed us, however, that they are unable to discuss the service 
contracts with the private sector prior to their formal announcement of the 
service contract structure. Until this constraint has been resolved, CERA has 
decided to have a conference call detailed below. We look forward to your 
participation. 

Regards,  

Mexico Gas and Power

**************************************************************************

TOPICS

*  Overview of proposed service contract structure

*  Assessing the attractiveness of the contracts

*  Expectations of future investment under proposed structure

FORMAT

Our speakers will address this topic for 30 minutes, with accompanying graphics 
presented on the Internet, followed by an open question and answer period.
