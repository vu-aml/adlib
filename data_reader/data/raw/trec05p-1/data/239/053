I spoke to Waymon Pong and Ken Ertman with PG&E today about the Electronic Commerce contract and discussed TW's concerns about the broad nature of the terms. I explained that all TW wanted was to have the ability to Nominate in PG&E's system when TW executed a Market Center deal. It turns out that TW has not lost it's ability to nominated in PG&E's system nor does it depend on TW signing the new contract, the new contract was meant to govern electronic contracts on the Marketing side of the deal. TK can continue to do her deals as she does today (fax and phone) and Customer Services Reps. can go into PG&E's PipeRanger system to nominate contracts. 

If you have any questions please give me a call ext. 37429
