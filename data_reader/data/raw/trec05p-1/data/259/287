 Did you ej=E0culate before or within a few minutes of penetr=E0tion?=20=


      Then you must order Extr=E0-Time Now!... Here's Why: Extr=E0-Time=
 is the only=20
      male sexu=E0l performance formula that, not only stops prem=E0tur=
e ej=E0culation,=20
    but actually "cures" it. Extr=E0-Time is the only product that allo=
ws "YOU"=20
   to control when you ejaculate.

Since 1997, Extra-Time has been ranked #1=20
    for a very good reason ... "It Works"! If you normally ej=E0culate =
within a few=20
      minutes of penetr=E0tion, then you must order Extra-Time. You'll =
last 5 to 10 minutes=20
      longer, the very first night..... GUARANTEED!=20
