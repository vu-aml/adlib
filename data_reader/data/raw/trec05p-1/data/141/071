Ed and I are going to dinner at Maggiano's on Wednesday and wanted to know
if anyone was interested in joining us.  We will most likely head up there
around 6:30ish.  Depending on how many people, I may try to get a
reservation, so let me know ASAP if you are interested in going.  If we
don't see you tomorrow, then hope you all have a Happy Thanksgiving.

Jennifer
