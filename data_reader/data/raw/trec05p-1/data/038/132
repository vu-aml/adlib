Coal and Emissions Trading

The first Enron Online synfuel trade occurred this past week, establishing EOL as the only online marketplace for synfuel.  The purpose of  bringing synfuel on EOL is to provide market transparency between the coal/synfuel spread.  

The coal cash book, which began trading only two months ago, has traded over 2 million spot tons.  The fundamental purpose of this book is to capture short term market discrepancies, while also adding liquidity to the spot market to further long term trading and marketing while reducing execution risk.
