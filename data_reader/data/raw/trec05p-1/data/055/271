Auguste Rodin 
2001 


Auguste Rodin was a continuously surprising artist. Restless, argumentative, tormented, he was always in search of the feeling, the meaning underlying reality, going beyond the perfection of shape - a shape that sometimes is clearly presented and sometimes left to the imagination of the viewer.

To understand Rodin one has to stand before one of this Master's works, letting our perception slide over all of its turns and bends, discovering all of its nuances, knowing that shapes change and are transformed as time elapses while allowing us to discover the artist's intentions. 

  <http://www.tozzini.com.br/rodin/lgtfts.gif>It was not by chance that Tozzini, Freire, Teixeira e Silva Advogados made this choice to celebrate its 25th anniversary. The boldness, the search for one's own style, the daringness, the permanent questioning are part of Rodin, and yet they also represent our way of feeling and carrying out our professional activity. 

In commemoration of Tozzini, Freire, Teixeira e Silva Advogados' 25th anniversary, the firm has the pleasure of inviting you to the cocktail party that will open the exhibition of the works of the French artist Auguste Rodin.
