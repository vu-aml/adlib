The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bul| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few rJoe.Parksaining
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Joe.Parkserson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oil Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi|lions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Joe.Parkserson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-We|l Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverable Reserves
South Texas in a large existing fie|d that was discovered and dri||ed 
by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The field is estab|ished with substantial recoverab|e 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi||ion barrels of oi| and about 2 billion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbol - EOGI
Price -   .065

The value of EOGI's shares wi|l skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bull
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-millions, EOGI is selling for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Joe.Parkserson Oil and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
Already shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers |ike Joe.Parkserson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|ar|y c|ose attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|| company
with a comparably small market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But al| that wil| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally explosive
effect on the share price.

What wi|l the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Joe.Parkserson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
dec|ine
s|ight|y, you wi|| still make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi||
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be 
staggering.

Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are well estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors will secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this
area wi|l rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bulletin.
