Dear Friend,
 
I am Dr. Peter Manalli a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am 
a Director of Project Implementation with the South Africa Department 
of Minerals and Energy. First and foremost, I apologize Using this 
medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but 
this is due to confidential and prompt access reposed on this medium. 
Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council 
(SAEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a 
trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me.
 
I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the 
execution of the deal described below for the benefit of all parties 
and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of 
this transaction. Within the Department of Minerals and Energy where I 
work as a Director and with the cooperation of four other top 
officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling 
Fourteen Million, Three Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars ($14,300,000.00) 
which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and co-operation 
of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf 
or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More 
so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil 
Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account 
hence your importance in the whole transaction. The amount $14.3m 
represents the balance of the total contract value on behalf of my 
Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-
invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid 
to the original contractor. Leaving the balance in the Tune of the 
said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by 
Key tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank account 
you will provide by filling in an application through the Justice 
Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of Rights and 
privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my 
partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us 
in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% of the 
$14.3million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous 
expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you 
treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentially. Also your area of 
specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this 
transaction.
 
I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not 
disappoint me. Endeavour to contact me immediately through my email 
address below or alternatively forward me a private telephone number i 
can reach you for confidentiality reasons weather or not you are 
interested in the deal. If you are not, it will enable me sort for 
another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure you 
that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of 
this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance 
and Guarantee that our share will be secured and pleased endeavour to 
treat this transaction with utmost confidentiality, because we will 
not comprehend with any form to exposure as we are still in active 
Government Services and remember once again that time is of the 
essence in this business.
 
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.
 
Yours faithfully, 
Dr Peter Manalli.
