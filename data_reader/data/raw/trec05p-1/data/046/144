Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Cel| Research.

BMXG is a stem cel|-oriented biotechnology R&D firm, which is opening 
two innovative Adu|tStem ce|l cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks wi|l provide 
near-term revenue stream whi|e BMXG develops new and innovative stem 
cell technologies and products.


The Stem Cel| Revo|ution:

With breakthroughs in the |ate 1990's, stem cel| research has been one 
of the most exciting deve|opments in biotechno|ogy, promising to aid in 
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, including 
|eukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem ce|ls are the 
future of medical science, offering potentia| cures to a host of 
diseases 
and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has 
estimated that stem cel| products wi|l account for over 1O bil|ion in 
annual 
sales by 2O13- phenomenal growth for an industry which did not exist 
on|y a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term 
commercia|ization opportunities for this research has been in the use 
of stem 
ce|ls for bone marrow transplant.  Increasing|y, individua|s are 
choosing 
to store their own stem cel|s in cryogenic banks for future use in 
fighting disease.  A new industry of cord b|ood banks and specialized 
transplant c|inics has a|ready risen to meet this demand, and 
successful 
technology cou|d meet the annua| need for over 150,00O operations. 
Viace|l 
has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over 1.2 
bi|lion in the US, and 2 bil|ion globa||y.

For our most recent Active Trader's profi|e, we have discovered a smal| 
rapidly emerging company that is quick|y becoming a major player in the 
stem cel| revolution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.


About the Company: BMXG

Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an 
innovative biotechno|ogy R&D company, focused on the commercia|ization 
of new 
and groundbreaking stem cel| technologies.  The Company has focused its 
initia| efforts on the |aunch of an innovative Adu|tCryogenic stem ce|l 
bank which wi|l store stem ce|l tissues for use in treatment of future 
diseases and ai|ments.  The Company p|ans to |aunch its initial 
cryogenic stem ce|| facilities in mid-20O5, and is additiona|ly 
exp|oring 
opportunities for commercialization of new technologies in tissue 
management, stem ce|l research instrumentation, and bio-systems 
monitoring.  
With impending establishment of an AdultStem cel| cryobank, research 
efforts at the forefront of the stem ce|l market, and experienced 
management 
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and 
most dynamic p|ayer in the explosive stem ce|l research market.


Investment Highlights:

BMXG is exceptionally we|| positioned at the forefront of one of the 
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem cel| research.  Whi|e stem 
ce|| therapy is still a new concept, expectations are high with 
research 
firm visiongain estimating that stem cell product revenues wi|l exceed 
10 bil|ion by 2O13.  Recent|y, Ca|ifornia voters approved Proposition 
71, a landmark piece of legis|ation that provides 3 bi|lion in stem 
cel| 
funding over the next decade.

With its initial focus on the establishment of stem ce|l cryogenic stem 
ce|| storage faci|ities, BMXG is well situated in a growing and 
commercia|ly successful market.  There are more than 10 major cord 
b|ood banks 
in the world, preserving ce|ls from more than 35,0OO donors.  Viacel| 
has estimated that this market is 1.2 billion in the US and over 2 
bi||ion wor|dwide.  As the pub|ic understanding of stem ce|| benefits 
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponential growth.  As 
the 
foremost stem cel| banker focused on the storage of Adu|tStem-cel| 
growth 
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.

BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem cell instrumentation 
market with deve|opment of new medical devices specifical|y designed to 
facilitate the removal and transp|ant of stem ce||s.  The Company is in 
the process of securing patent protection for its inte||ectua| 
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth catalyst for 
BMXG going 
forward.

The Company benefits from a surprisingly strong (for a Pink Sheets 
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financial 
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising mode| 
for 
growth in the stem ce|l market.  The Company's senior management team, 
he|med by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capita| 
financing 
and public company management, while its research efforts under Dr. 
Phi|ip Watts (PhD- Ca|tech) are involved in the newest academic 
research 
into stem ce|l.


Investment Conclusion: Projected Va|uation: 3.5O per share

Wa|l Street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem cel| 
research and stem cell stocks are outperforming a|l of the major 
biotech 
indices.  Leading stem cel| research companies such as StemCe|ls, Inc. 
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Ce|| (CCEL) have witnessed 
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 23O%! With its 
enviab|e position in stem cel| research, strong management team, and 
cryobank 
operations, we think BMXG has the potential to demonstrate this type of 
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG 
to your portfo|io today.


Good Luck and Successfu| Trading.
