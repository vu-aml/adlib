						<div class=3D"GreyHeading">INSIDE SPORT PRESENTER GABBY LOGAN</div>
						<div>Hi everyone, Gabby here.
<br>

<br>
Tonight on Inside Sport - it's the hot topic everyone's talking about - Bec=
ks is Back for England.=20
<br>

<br>
We've been to Madrid to talk to fans and players - they're already wishing =
they hadn't let him go and Ruud Van Nistelrooy tells us he wants Real to ge=
t Beckham back on loan.
<br>

<br>
Also tonight - when you meet world champion boxer Ricky Hatton, he comes as=
 a job lot. In one amazing day with Ricky I also met his brother Matthew, h=
is mum and his dad. It was a bit like the Osbournes, only nicer and more no=
rthern.
<br>

<br>
We've also been to see Dwain Chambers in Germany where he's trying to build=
 himself a new future as an American Football player.=20=20
<br>

<br>
He was banned for two years for taking performance-enhancing drugs when he =
was Britain's top sprinter and, he told Matthew Pinsent, he still thinks th=
e science is way ahead of the testers when it comes to drugs.
<br>

<br>
All that and the chance to win tickets to Wimbledon!=20
<br>

<br>
So join me for Inside Sport at 2305 BST, BBC ONE.
<br>

<br>

<b>
Gabby hosts Inside Sport on Monday 28 May, 2305 BST on BBC ONE, and the sec=
ond edition on Sunday 3 June, 1130 BST on BBC TWO.</b>
