All the organs of the body were having a meeting, trying to decide who was 
> the one in charge. 
> 
> "I should be in charge," said the brain, "Because I run all the body's 
> systems, so without me nothing would happen." 
> 
> "I should be in charge" said the blood, "because I circulate oxygen all 
> over, so without me you'd all waste away." 
> 
> "I should be in charge," said the stomach," because I process food and 
> give all of you energy." 
> 
> "I should be in charge" said the legs, "because I carry the body wherever 
> it needs to go." 
> 
> "I should be in charge" said the eyes, "because I allow the body to see 
> where it goes." 
> 
> "I should be in charge, said the rectum, "Because I'm responsible for 
> waste removal." All the other body parts laughed at the rectum and 
> insulted him, so in a huff, he shut down tight. Within a few days, the 
> brain had a terrible  headache, the stomach was bloated, the legs got 
> wobbly, the eyes got watery  and the blood was toxic. They all decided 
> that the rectum should be the  boss. 
> 
> The Moral of the story?  The asshole is usually in charge.
