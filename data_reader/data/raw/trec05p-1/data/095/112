Anthony Pescetti has applied for a position on FERC.  He would like to
speak with someone at Enron about FERC and the position he has applied
for.  Originally he asked to speak with Hedy, however she will be
traveling until mid November.  I check with Hedy, and she asked that we
refer the Assemblymember to you.

If you would like to contact the Assemblymember directly, his office
number is (916) 319-2010.  However, this is your call, if you do not
want to discuss his application for a position with FERC with him,
someone on our staff can contact his office.

I will be out of town until October 29th. Andrew Govenar can assist
you.  Thank you.
