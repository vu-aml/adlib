I will see what I can do about the cut-over.  Until the email this morning, I had been told that we had until Thursday morning.  The contingency plan in the east is to have Corry's folks come down and help the estate staff using estate logins.  Is this possible for you folks as well.
 
Tom.

Jason,
 
Why has this now changed to Monday from Thursday morning and who made this decision?
 
Will we be able to schedule Monday without the UBS folks?
 
Tom
