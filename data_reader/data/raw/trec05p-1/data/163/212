Comrades:

Each year, we students have the opportunity to
recognize from among the esteemed faculty members of
Haas those who have distinguished themselves from
their peers by their commitment to the least glamorous
of their tasks: teaching us stupid kids how to read,
write and do complicated long division sums. The Earl
F. Cheit Award for Outstanding Teaching goes to that
individual we deem worthy, from a pool of candidates
we nominate, based solely on our judgment as students
about our instructors (or maybe we just like their
looks--but let that not dissuade us from our sense of
duty).  The administration and faculty have no voice
in this award process, but must gaze upon us silently,
in awe and amazement at our power of discernment.  

Faculty who receive the Outstanding Teacher Award are
recognized for this important accomplishment by both
the UC Berkeley Campus and the Haas School of
Business. Last year's award went to Jonathan Leonard
(Core: Micro) with honorable mentions to Jonathan
Berke (Core: Finance) and Sarah Tasker (Elective:
Financial Information Analysis.) 


We are currently soliciting nominations for Fall 2001
courses. So, if you have gotten over your indignation
for having been put in the dunce corner once too
often, and finished copying “I will not put motor oil
in Professor Lyon’s hot cocoa ever again” one hundred
times, you may reply to this email with your
nomination. Alternatively, if your server is as balky
as mine, submit a hard copy to the Evening MBA office.


We can only consider nominations with a written
explanation. There will be another round of
nominations for Spring 2002, but please remember that
only one nomination per student is accepted, so if you
nominate another faculty member in the Spring, it will
supercede this Fall's nomination.  In May, we will
select one individual from all nominations, based on
number of nominations received and the strength of
feeling exhibited by the nominors. 

Thanks, in advance, for your support of this important
and prestigious award. 

Joe Tambornino 
Chairman - Student Advisory Committee
