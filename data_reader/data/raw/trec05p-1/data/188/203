		MARKET NOTICE
		January 4, 2002

		Resumption of Preliminary Invoicing

		ISO Market Participants:
	SC Settlement Contacts:

		The ISO will resume issuing Preliminary Invoices starting
with the November 2001 trade month.  
		On August 30, 2001, the ISO distributed a notice indicating
that it would temporarily suspend making cash distributions based on
preliminary invoices.  The notice further indicated that this practice was
to be effective for the June, 2001 billing cycle. Beginning with the July
2001 trade month, the ISO temporarily halted issuance of the preliminary
invoices entirely.  Subsequently, the ISO issued a single monthly invoice on
the date that it issued the Final Settlement Statement for the last Trade
Day of the calendar month. Thus, the ISO neither collected nor dispersed
funds until the final invoice was distributed.  
		This suspension of the "two invoice" settlements approach
was a temporary action.  The ISO will resume issuing Preliminary Invoices
starting with November 2001 trade month.  This is consistent with ISO's
proposal in the November 21, 2001 compliance filing for FERC's November 7
order.  November 2001 Preliminary Invoices are scheduled to be generated on
January 29, 2002.
		If you have questions regarding this procedure, please
contact your Account Manager.
