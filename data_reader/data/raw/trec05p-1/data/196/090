Larry,
Hope you have been taking it easy.  I know I have been.  I am writing to ask if you would like to have pipe options valued with vol skew (the change that we put on hold in oct) for Netco.

Brad:

In regard to the change in PortCalc to handle volatility skew for Larry's basis options, Larry requested to have the change put on hold.
Could you please check with him if he would like this change in production for NetCo?

Thanks,
Jeremy

Jennifer,
I have talked to Larry and he would like to wait a while before he puts the vol skew revision into production.  I will let you know when we are ready for it.

Jennifer,
I could not pull up anything on post-id 1391544.  I tried it in production port calc and test port calc.  Can you please take a look at it for me.

Also I would like to test a few individual deals.  Should I send you the deal # and let you run minibooks?

Brad,

I used the new port_calc to run the full book, and the post-id is 1391379. Please take a look at it and let us know your feedback. If you need any further testing, please do not hesitate to call me. Thanks.

Brad,

Jeremy has a new port_calc ready for test. This new version will apply vol skew on basis options correctly. 
I calculated a mini-book on deal 'YG8699.1'. The post-id is 1387936. Please take a look at it.

If you have any other post-ids you want to test with this new version, please let me know, so I can run this new port_calc for you.

Thanks,
Jennifer

Thank you very much, that is exactly what I wanted to know.
Yes if the IF vol curve exists, use IF-vol + NG skew, if IF vol curve does not exsist, use NG vol + NG skew

Subject:	vol skew

Brad, 

I did two post-ids. I used the current production port_calc (3.15) to calculate 1389454 and I used the old version(3.14) to calculate 1389464. I do see a P& L change on 1389454.

I debugged it and found a bunch of deals with changes in P& L value. Enclosed is a partial list of those deals. The reasons are: 

In old version(3.14), we calculate volatility of basis options like this

1) we calculate the NG volatility
2) If it's a basis option, we fetch the IF- volatility curve. If IF- volatility curve exists, we use IF-volatility curve.
3) If IF- volatility curve does not exist, we still use NG volatility.

In the current production version(3.15), we calculate volatility of basis options like this

1) we calculate the NG volatility + NG vol skew. (The NG vol skew is based on NG price - fixed price)
2) If it's a basis option, we fetch the IF-volatility curve. If IF-volatility curve exists, we use IF- volatility curve.
3) If IF-volatility curve does not exist, we still use NG volatility + NG vol skew which was calculated in step 1).

The bug in the currenct production portcalc is that in step 2), we didn't apply vol skew upon IF vol. In our new fix, this bug will be fixed.

However, the IF volatility curves of those enclosed deals do not exist. So the current production version (3.15) used the NG vol + NG vol skew for those deals. The old version (3.14) used the NG vol for those deals. Thus you see P&L change in these two versions.

Also we'd like to confirm with you that in the new fix, if the IF vol curve does not exist, you still want us to use NG vol + NG vol skew instead of erroring out. If the IF vol curve exists, we will use IF vol + NG vol skew.

Thanks,
Jennifer
