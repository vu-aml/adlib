    Marcus -  I'm having this translated into Word and resending. This reflects the market power study done for Sandhills, an Enron affiliate, in March.   (While we have filed more recent applications in cases involving Enron, they were for sales of plants to third parties, and therefore studied the 3rd party's market power, not Enron's).   We haven't found anything more recent, but you would probably know that better than I. 

       We have found several existing Enron affiliates with market rate authority who did not make any sales in the second quarter of 2001.  They might be useful as shells, but I don't know whwther they'd work from an internal corporate perspective.   Those shells are North Carolina Power Holding, West Fork, and two others. 

 Maybe you could make sales through them for a few days.  At that point, I can call FERC staff and see if we're going to get the new entitiy's authority backdated to today.   If we get a good word from staff, we can then start selling from the new entity.  If not, the worst tcase is that we sell from North Carolina Power (etc) under their existing authority for 60 days, and then start selling under the new entity's name.

Sam - I need to see if we can open Word Perfect files as I am unable to
open the document at the moment. Does this document also contain the
latest Market Power Analysis Enron filed?
	
Regards,
