This language looks fine to me, but ELIZABETH is the structure ok with you? (The participating transmission owners (PTO) will be getting paid their revenue requirements by the RTO, so I think the RTO and the PTOs having a lock box is fine.  (from what I can recall from my old accountant days).  Thanks.

Christi and Susan,

Below is a message that I had sent to Steve Walton earlier this morning asking for his assessment of a section of the Acme (DSTAR) TCA.  Can you tell me if the text below is standard practice or is it more than favorable to the PTO?

Thanks,

Dave

Steve,

Are you familar with any fund(s) management in the context of RTO West or other such entity.  Below is some of the language in the "Acme" aka DSTAR TCA, I am not expereinced in this at all, but some of this looks suspect to me (Too may PTO rights).  Any comments you have would be helpful.

Thanks,

Dave
