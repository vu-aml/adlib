In the first year of a regular two year session it would mean that they
would pick up where they left off.  However, because these bills were
introduced in the special session, they would need to start another special
session and do a rule waiver to reactivate those measures.  Even then, when
they closed the first special session and started the second special
session, bills which had already passed out of their house of origin had to
be reactivated on the floor of their house of origin. If the Governor
changes his mind and does not start another special session all of the bills
will be dead.

What does "held" mean?  Do they start over or do they pick up where they
left off?
