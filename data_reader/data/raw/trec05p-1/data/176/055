<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=4>Latest NFL Player News</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=1264&"><B>Jeff Graham</B></A>, WR SD - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=1663&"><B>Antowain Smith</B></A>, RB NE - JWillie <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.   </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=1069&"><B>Steve McNair</B></A>, QB TEN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=146325&"><B>Jeff Garcia</B></A>, QB SF - JWillie <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=1174&"><B>Eddie George</B></A>, RB TEN - Tori <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the game.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=1612&"><B>Oronde Gadsden</B></A>, WR MIA - Matty <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=12207&"><B>Fred Beasley</B></A>, RB SF - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=1511&"><B>Joe Horn</B></A>, WR NO - Matty <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>
<A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=188183&"><B>Maurice Smith</B></A>, RB ATL - Frank <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=12431&"><B>Donald Hayes</B></A>, WR CAR - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>
<A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=235174&"><B>Chris Weinke</B></A>, QB CAR - Tori <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=12797&"><B>Kurt Warner</B></A>, QB STL - Hunter <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=1034&"><B>Rich Gannon</B></A>
, QB OAK - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=12576&"><B>Randy Moss</B></A>, WR MIN - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=235122&"><B>Marvin Minnis</B></A>, WR KC - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=1310&"><B>Michael Westbrook</B></A>, WR WAS - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=235213&"><B>Rod Gardner</B></A>, WR WAS - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>
<A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=1471&"><B>Tony Richardson</B></A>, RB KC - Neal/McKay <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=12400&"><B>Tony Gonzalez</B></A>, TE KC - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=1028&"><B>Brett Favre</B></A>, QB GB - Frank <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=1599&"><B>Trent Green</B></A>, QB KC - Bass/Hull <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=1593&"><B>Bill Schroeder</B></A>, WR GB - Frank <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR>
<A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=12429&"><B>Matt Hasselbeck</B></A>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=1223&"><B>Johnnie Morton</B></A>, WR DET - Hunter <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Morton has been inconsistent this season but he will still be a solid No. 2 during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=235256&"><B>Reggie Wayne</B></A>, WR IND - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>
Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement. But he is not accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=1262&"><B>Amani Toomer</B></A>, WR NYG - Tori <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Toomer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2 wideout during your playoffs.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=1231&"><B>Marvin Harrison</B></A>, WR IND - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not in the playoff race. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=1757&"><B>Duce Staley</B></A>, RB PHI - Giggles <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Staley started to play well late in the season.
