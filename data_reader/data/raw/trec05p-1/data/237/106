I am Barrister Andrew Thambo an attorney of Clifford Alexander's Attorney in Johannesburg, South Africa .A special client of mine mandated me to look for over sea's company, agent or an individual who can act as his over sea's partner's in his proposed investment in real estate/property in their country and also investment in some blue chip company's
However the companies or individual's involvement will be properly paid for although the term's and condition's are negotiable?
Expecting your swift response.Our second chamber's email is andy_thambo_jhb@yahoo.com

Regard's
