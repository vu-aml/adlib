Eric,
Thanks for doing an excellent job editing the press release; we all liked the new format.  

I made a few minor changes, as follows:
HMS paragraph moved to second to last, instead of last
Capitalized the words, President and Internet

 
Please proceed with publishing the press release through the various publications I forwarded earlier this week.

Thanks, 
Lisa Druzbik

Attached is a draft press advisory for Enron Producer One.  Please distribute to all who need to see it for their comments.  The list of publications is fine.  Once teh language in the advisory is approved, we will use a combination of faxes and phone calls to drum up interest in the story.

Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Eric
