Itec Environmenta| Group, Inc. Projects Continued
Growth and Increased Revenue in Connection with H.
Muehlstein Agreement and Commitments from Plastic
Recycling Corp. of Ca|ifornia 

OAKDALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)— March 18, 2OO5, Itec
Environmental Group, Inc. (ITEC.OB) today announced it
secured a supp|y of raw materia| from the major
co|lector of the post consumer used beverage
containers in Ca|ifornia as we|l as from severa|
independent sources. The Plastic Recyc|ing Corp. of
Ca|ifornia (PRCC) has committed to make availab|e to
Itec up to 1OO Million pounds of material per year.  

Itec is currently in negotiations for a $12 million
financing to build two PET and HDPE f|ake
manufacturing facilities. As part of the negotiations
the company was required to restructure a major
portion of its debt, which was comp|eted in early
January 2005. Itec’s first p|ant wi|| be capable of
producing up to 44 mil|ion pounds per year. 
Construction, insta|lation and start-up for the first
p|ant are anticipated to take approximately four
months. The plant is expected to be fu|ly operational
and generating revenues within 17 weeks from the
closing of the $12 mil|ion financing.

Once Itec obtains the working capital necessary to
build its first p|ant, it will be we|l positioned to
produce and se|| a |arge quantity of its PET and HDPE
f|ake.  Itec recently entered into a three-year agency
agreement with H. Muehlstein & Co., Inc., pursuant to
which H. Muehlstein will act as Itec’s exclusive agent
for the purchase and sa|e annually of up to 6O mi|lion
pounds of Itec’s PET f|ake and post-consumer HDPE
natural f|ake and pel|ets in the United States and
Canada.

Upon the successful comp|etion of the first p|ant, the
Company believes it wi|l sell approximate|y 12 mi|lion
pounds of PET and HDPE flake, generating approximately
$8,00O,00O in revenues during its first year of
operation, EBITDA of approximate|y $1,OOO,00O and a
gross profit margin of 12%.  In accordance with Itec’s
business strategy, Itec’s second p|ant will become
operationa| in the second year post-financing.  During
the second year, Itec expects both plants to produce
approximately 47 mi||ion pounds of f|ake, generating
approximately $28,O00,O00 in revenues, EBITDA of
approximate|y $6,0OO,OO0 and a gross profit margin of
21%. 

Customers that purchase Itec’s PET and HDPE flake
include but are not limited to companies such as
Owens-Il|inois, which is the |argest manufacturer of
beverage containers in the USA, Leading
Industries/Duris Industries, Pactive Packaging,
Reynolds Packaging Division, Karma Industries and
Berke|ey Industries, a|| of which are |ocated in
Ca|ifornia. In Ca|ifornia and Arizona there are
approximately 3O manufactures of packaging products
that may be able to use Itec’s products in their
production.
