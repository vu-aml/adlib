Today we opened the valve to the Farmer's Ag Hancock, Minnesota corn dryer. It is on the Benson Branchline, POI 78110. The procedure on this facility is as follows: When we approach our minimum pressure at Benson (350 psi or less), we will call the two people listed below, day or night, and let them know we are shutting the valve. We should not re-open again until we are comfortable with the pressures. This facility is 100% interruptible and should be shut-in any time we are concerned about the Benson Pressure. As you can see, this is a Utilicorp customer, not a Minneagasco customer, so you should not communicate with Minnegasco concerning the operation of this plant. Be SURE to log all activities concerning the valve operation and who you communicated with when you shut or open the valve. As always, we also need to work with Minnegasco as well when pressure problems occur, about cutting back their load as well, but this corn dryer should be in the first call. thanks. sj

FYI.

A contact at Farmer's Ag if we need to shut in the point this fall is:  

Chad Lozinski
Office:  320-392-5927
Cell:     320-808-3824
Home:  320-392-7321

I would suggest we also contact Eric Rodenburg at UCU if possible:
Phone:  402-926-5266
24 hr:    888-337-6134

Status:

Talked to Mitch Olsen, NNG field tech, today.  Mitch indicated he is to meet a UCU representative at the site on 9/10 to test the communications.  Mitch will let me know how that goes.  Told Mitch we cannot turn on the valve until everything is a go.
