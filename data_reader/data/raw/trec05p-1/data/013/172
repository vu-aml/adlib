NLRB 4-0 APPROVES CROWN CORK'S USE OF SEVEN EMPLOYEE
COMMITTEES

Crown Cork & Seal's use of four production teams and three
other employee participation committees at its aluminum can
manufacturing plant in Texas does not violate federal labor
law, the National Labor Relations Board rules unanimously
("Crown Cork & Seal Co., "334 N.L.R.B. No. 92, 7/20/01
[released 7/25/01]).

Chairman Hurtgen and Members Liebman, Truesdale, and Walsh
agree with an administrative law judge's findings that the
seven committees are not employer-dominated labor
organizations. Rather than "dealing with" management in a
bilateral fashion of making proposals that are accepted or
rejected by management, the committees exercise authority,
delegated by management, to operate the plant within certain
parameters, the board decides.

Since the opening of Crown Cork's plant in 1984, the company
has used an employee management system called the
"socio-tech system" designed to delegate substantial
authority to employees to operate the plant through
participation on permanent and temporary teams, boards, and
committees that reach decision through discussion and
consensus. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-1

COURT SAYS LESBIANS HAVE NO TITLE VII SUIT AGAINST
CHILDREN'S HOME

Two workers denied employment at the Kentucky Baptist Home
for Children Inc. because of their homosexuality failed to
establish that the employer violated Title VII of the 1964
Civil Rights Act's prohibition against religious
discrimination, the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Kentucky rules ("Pedreira v. Ky. Baptist Homes
for Children,  "W.D. Ky.,  No. 3:00CV-210-S,  7/23/01).

Granting summary judgment to KBHC on the Title VII claim,
Judge Simpson rules that Alicia Pedreira's and Karen Vance's
religious freedom was not intruded upon by the employer
because there was no evidence that their homosexuality was
premised on their religious beliefs or lack thereof.
However, the court finds that the two plaintiffs, joined by
seven others, may proceed with their lawsuit challenging on
constitutional grounds Kentucky's granting of public funds
to the home. . . . Page A-2

 KENNEDY TO ADDRESS GENETIC BIAS BILL'S OVERLAP OF ADA,
PRIVACY RULES

Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee
Chairman Kennedy (D-Mass.) says he will examine how current
law addresses genetic bias as the committee considers a bill
(S. 318) that would prohibit employers and health insurers
from discriminating against individuals based on their
genetic information.

At a committee hearing on genetic discrimination, several
Republican lawmakers express concern that the bill,
sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Daschle (D-S.D.), is not
consistent with current civil rights laws. Kennedy calls
those concerns "legitimate" and says most lawmakers agree
that legislation barring genetic discrimination should not
duplicate existing law. Kennedy says he expects Congress to
pass further legislation barring genetic bias, even after
taking into account the protections in current law.

Daschle says his bill would prohibit employers from making
employment decisions based on predictive genetic
information. The measure also would prohibit employers from
requesting, requiring, or disclosing a person's genetic
information without his or her informed consent, he says. .

UNION-REPRESENTED EMPLOYEE CANNOT SUE FOR WRONGFUL DISCHARGE

A union-represented employee who was fired after filing a
workers' compensation claim cannot sue his employer for
wrongful discharge, a federal judge in Philadelphia rules,
dismissing the claim of a former American Red Cross employee
("Harper v. American Red Cross Blood Services, "E.D. Pa.,
No. 01-1676, 7/17/01).

"[W]e agree with other courts that the Labor Management
Relations Act would be frustrated if a plaintiff like [Gary]
Harper could 'end-run the grievance procedure outlined in
his collective bargaining agreement by filing a wrongful
discharge claim in court,'" writes Judge Joyner of the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
Although a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision permitted
wrongful discharge suits in a similar situation, the
employees in that case were at-will workers who did not have
union representation. . . . Page A-3

NEW CONTRACTS RAISE MANUFACTURING PAY 3.1 PERCENT ON AVERAGE

Data compiled by BNA in the first 30 weeks of 2001 show
newly bargained contracts in the manufacturing industry
provided a weighted average first-year gain of 3.1, compared
with 3.5 percent in 2000, while agreements in the
nonmanufacturing sector (excluding construction) produced a
weighted average increase of 4.1 percent, unchanged from the
comparable period in 2000. The current median manufacturing
increase was 3 percent, the same increase as reported a year
ago, and the median nonmanufacturing increase was 3.9
percent, compared with 3.4 percent.

Among new settlements included in the latest biweekly wage
tabulation are: a three-year contract between Maytag Co. and
the United Auto Workers; a three-year agreement between Walt
Disney World Co. and the Service Trades Council; and a
five-year agreement between the Building Contractors
Association of New York and the Laborers' International
Union. . . . Page D-1
