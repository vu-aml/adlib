Jeff:

I am glad to see that you are finally working on getting educated!

I am also trying to finish my last three units.  I started in 1987...long
story.

Hope all is well with you.

Lee

P.S. I recently moved to AZ.

Greetings.  Thanks for the welcome back.

Couple things:

1) how many units do I need to graduate?
2) where can I go (other than scrounge up the pieces of paper I receive
in the mail at the end of every semester) to find out how many units
I've thus far accumulated?

Finally, I notice that you mentioned that Shelansky's class is full up,
even the waiting the list. Would I be ejected from the program if I
nonetheless tried to get in?

Look forward to seeing you soon.

Best,
Jeff

Hi Evening MBA Students,

Welcome back to school!  Here are a few updates regarding the Fall 2001
semester:

Continuing Students:
Classes begin the week of Monday, August 27.

Confirmed Class Schedule:
Please come by the Evening MBA office on the first night of classes
to review your confirmed class schedule.  We'd also like you to fill out
an
Address Update Form with current information on employer and other
contact
information.  Whether you have updates or not, please come by the office

and sign the form so we will be able to include your information in the
Fall 2001 student address directory.

Waitlists:
If you are on a waitlist for any course, I'll update the waitlist
status each Friday afternoon.  I'll let you know by e-mail as soon as
you are officially enrolled and will let you know when to pick up the
textbooks/readers.

Add/Drops:
If you plan to add or drop any courses, please come into the office and
fill out an add/drop form when classes begin.  If you are dropping a
course
and you received books and/or readers for the course, please return them

with the form.  This is required.  We'll order books for you when you
add a
class.  Please note that we are unable to return reading packets for
credit, so if you drop a course we will try to find another student who
wants to add the course and needs the reader.  However, if no other
student
is adding the course, you will be responsible for reimbursing us for the

cost of the reader.

Day Classes:
If you are interested in taking day classes, a list of Fall 2001 day
electives will be available in the Evening MBA office when classes
begin.  Please let me know the course number and title by e-mail.
Course
descriptions for day classes can be found at:
http://haas.berkeley.edu/Courses/courses.html.
If space is available in a day class, the full-time MBA Program staff
will
add you manually to the course.  Please don't add through
Telebears.  During the first three weeks of classes, I'll confirm the
availability of seats by e-mail on Fridays.  Please note that BA294
units
cannot be used toward your MBA degree requirements.

Textbooks and Readers:
You may pick up textbooks and reading/case packets by coming to the
Evening
MBA Program office.  We are open Monday-Thursday 9:00 a.m.-8:15 p.m and
Friday 9:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m..  Textbooks and readers will also be
available
to you the first week of classes Monday-Thursday 5:00-6:00 p.m. and
during
your break in room F621.

Health Insurance Waivers:
The deadline to submit your waiver was July 15, 2001, and a credit will
show up on your next statement if you submitted a form on time.  Please
call University Health Services at (510) 642-5700 if you have any
questions
or to see if it is possible to submit a late form.

Shuttle Buses:
The shuttle pick-up times will remain the same as last semester 4:15
p.m.  The South Bay Shuttle pick-up location remains the same, at Our
Lady's Way, not S3 Inc. parking lot.

Parking:
To obtain your parking permits and passes we ask that you:
(1) come by the office to pick up your permit and passes, or
(2) drive to the Kleeberger Field Lot where one of the student workers
will
have your permit and passes ready for you to pick up from 5:00 -6:00
p.m.
during the first week of classes.  Before and after the first week, you
may pick up your passes from the office.

Writing Requirement:
The last day for Fall 2000 students to submit writing samples for the
Writing Requirement is Monday, September 17.  Students who have not
fulfilled their writing requirements will not be able to pre-roll in
Spring
2002 courses.

Course Updates:
E264    High Tech Marketing:  first class meets Saturday, August 25,
9:00
a.m.-12:00 noon at Intel (directions e-mailed to registered students).

E228 Taxes & Firm Strategy, Suneel Udpa has been cancelled.

New Class:
E296-3 Technology Sector Literacy, Sarah Tasker, 2 units, Tuesdays 6:00
p.m.-9:30 p.m.  ABSTRACT:  This course is a beta test of a new course
under
development.  The new course will be aimed exclusively at students with
zero technical background, and will provide an overview of the
technologies
and companies that comprise the IT (information technology)
industry.  Enrollment in Fall 2001 is by permission of the instructor
only.  Interested students should contact Sarah Tasker at
tasker@haas.berkeley.edu and cc: tj@haas.berkeley.edu.  See
http://haas.berkeley.edu/Courses/courses.html.
