<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Quintek Technologies, through its wholly-owned 
subsidiary Quintek Services, Inc. (QSI), delivers 21st-century Business Process 
Outsourcing (BPO) services and solutions that enable organizations of any size 
to secure and manage their key data processing demands with optimal efficiency 
and minimal costs. As a next-generation technology company, Quintek is 
unhindered by outdated information technology systems, and thus is able to 
deploy best-of-breed solutions in all aspects of BPO computer applications and 
Information Lifecycle Management (ILM). Quintek provides a range of 
mission-critical information and document-management solutions to organizations 
in document-intensive industries, including government, public utilities, 
healthcare, insurance, financial, legal, telecommunications and manufacturing. 
The Company has built steady growth on a strategy of providing superior services 
and solutions, and continues to exploit the steadily increasing growth in BPO 
and ILM marketplaces; the Aberdeen Group, a provider of IT market intelligence, 
forecasts 13% annual growth for the BPO industry through 2005, when the market 
is projected to reach $248 billion.</FONT></P>
