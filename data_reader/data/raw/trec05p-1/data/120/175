Gentlemen. I am writing to let you know that I have recently been appointed
as president and COO of all of GPC's operations ouside of Canada and the US.
So please let me know if I can help in any foreign markets at all. You will
recall my/GPC's work for Enron on Project Stanley here in Canada.

On another matter, If in anyway we can help you on the current situation
regarding market confidence let me know. I would be more than willing to put
together of our  best people in GPC Fleishman Hillard or Omnicom to come
down and brain storm about media relations, investor communications or
anything else.

Good luck.


Tom McLaren
President and COO, International
