Jeff, I was talking to Mike Etringer yesterday regarding this subject and he gave me the name of the CFO Ted Craver. I understand that you guys were dealing with John Fielder.  
 
For sure we want to know what they are up to.  I think like all deals in California we are going to run into issues with credit, and probably paper but that would pretty much depend on the counterparty. ( is it edison), or DWR? 
 
It is VERY important that trading and marketing are aware of the hedging activities in a very timely fashion so however we need to ensure that happens will be my plan. 
 
Do you know the CFO ? 
 
regards, BT

FYI.  Edison's filing for approval to hedge power up to $250MM.  If you'd like to get in front of Edison's CFO on this. Let me know.
 
Best,
Jeff
