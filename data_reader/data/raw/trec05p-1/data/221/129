LEADING TODAY'S ISSUE:
DOE REQUEST PUMPS UP NNSA, TRIMS CLEANUP, FOSSIL FUEL ACCOUNTS

to the homeland security theme espoused by President Bush during his State 
of the Union. Cuts were reserved for non-defense environmental cleanup and 
fossil fuel energy research and development, with a targeted 6 percent 
increase set aside for the National Nuclear Security Administration.
