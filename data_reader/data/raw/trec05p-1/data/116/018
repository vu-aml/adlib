Dear Sara: please kindly forward your response to my email of 15 March which
attached the "marked-up" Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement. Your prompt
response would be greatly appreciated as our credit department is extremely
keen that these agreements are executed immediately.
I thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Kind regards
Anita
