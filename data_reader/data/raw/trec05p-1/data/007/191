Judy,

I am in process of finalizing the basic GISB Contract to prepare it for
execution....
However, I need to get a response back from you regarding OUR Special
Provisions I sent you....Most likely, we will have to COMBINE both of the
YOURS & OUR Special Provisions into one document....At that time, I will
forward it to our Legal Dept. for final review as they have to approve it...

I will await your response...Thanks!
