We have begun working on our first deliverables for the Risk Management
Simulation project. The first thing we need your sign-off on is the Target
Audience Analysis. We have defined the key characteristics of our target
audience in order to help us maintain focus as we design the simulation.

I would appreciate it if you could review the attached document and respond
by end of day Monday, the 10th, with either your revisions or your
sign-off. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you.
Mery
