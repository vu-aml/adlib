Carrie,

I've been speaking with Sara Shackleton in Legal and she would prefer if you view the requested contracts in her office (she keeps the files there).  That would avoid duplication of effort (from Laurel Adams and me) and Sara can answer any contract questions better than I can.

Thanks,
SBR x30569

Sorry, I've got one more request.  I also need the Enron entity on each

   Stacey,

   Please see attached revised contract request list.  I have inserted a
   column identifying the Global Counterparty ID#s and have changed the
   counterparty name to how it appears in Global Counterparty.  Please let
   me
   know if this is useful.  I appreciate all of your help.

   Thank you,
   Carrie
