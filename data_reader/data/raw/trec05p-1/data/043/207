ABX2 2 (Corbett) - (windfall profits) was just amended on the Assembly
floor.  The amendments make the bill revenue neutral, among other things,
which makes it a simple majority vote bill. The bill could be heard by the
full Assembly as early as Thursday.

ABX2 65 (Cardoza) - (market manipulation) was just amended on the Assembly
floor.  The amendments remove the opposition of every entity except the
generators and marketers.  The bill could be heard by the full Assembly as
early as Thursday.
