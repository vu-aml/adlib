I am Mr. Chow Wong , Bank Manager Wing Hang Bank,
Stubbs Road Branch, Hong Kong.  I have urgent and very
confidential business proposition for you.  Mr Guy
Gelinas a Canadian businessman and longtime business
associate of erstwhile Hong Kong business tycoon James
Ting , made a numbered time (Fixed)Deposit for twelve
calendar month, valued at US$38,500,000.00 (Thirty
Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my
branch. Upon maturity, I sent routine notification to
his forwarding address but get no reply. After a
month, we send a reminder and finally we discover from
his contract employer, (Abitibi - Consolidated Paper)
that Mr.Guy Gelinas died in plane crash along with
many others in EgyptAir Flight 990,1999 air crash (for
more information about said funds and this crash you
can go to the links:

Since i get this information about his death and
on further investigation, I find out that he died
without making a WILL, and all attempt to traced his
next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore make further
investigation and discovered that Mr.Guy Gelinas did
not declare any kin or relations in all his official
documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my
Bank, and Mr. James Ting is no longer factor in this
transaction. This sum of US$38,500,000.00 is still
sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled
over with the principal sum at the end of each year.
No one will ever come forward to claim it. According
to Laws of Hong Kong, at the expiration of 7
(seven)years, the money will revert to the ownership
of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim
the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will
like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin
to Mr.Guy Gelinas so that the fruits of this man's
labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt
government officials. This is simple, I will like you
to provide immediately your full names and address so
that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents
and affidavits that will put you in place as the next
of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney
for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to
obtain the necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.
A bank account in any part of the world that you will
provide will then facilitate the transfer of this
money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money
will be paid into your account for us to share in the
ratio of 85% for me and 15% for you. There is no risk
at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will
be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch
Manager guarantees the successful execution of this
transaction. If you are interested, please reply
immediately via the private email address above. Upon
your response, I shall then provide you with more
details and relevant documents that will help you
understand the transaction. Please send me your
confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy
communication. Please observe utmost confidentiality,
and rest assured that this transaction would be most
profitable for both of us because I shall require your
assistance to invest my share in your country. 
Awaiting your urgent reply to my e-mail address:
chow_lee@ozu.es
 Regards, 
 Chow Wong
