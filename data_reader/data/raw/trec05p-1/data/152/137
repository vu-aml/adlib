I received a call from Portland General Electric (PGE) asking for assistance in posting an open season for them in regards to their Kelso-Beaver Pipeline.  The reason they are asking for assistance is that they currently do not have an electronic bulletin board.  I have attached a draft version of their open season.  The plan would be to utilize the Hot Tap platform for their posting.
 
Please advise if you have any comments regarding this issue.
 
Thank you.
