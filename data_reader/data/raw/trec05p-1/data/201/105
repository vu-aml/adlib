Crude Oil Futures Continue Downward Spiral

Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX tumbled $0.89 to 
$17.97 per barrel yesterday, settling below $18.00 per barrel for the 
first time since November of 1999. The session low of $17.80 per 
barrel was the lowest level for front month crude since it hit an 
intraday low of $17.29 per barrel last November. The last 9 sessions 
have seen February crude futures plunge by $3.51 per barrel with an 
unusually mild winter slicing demand and swelling oil and products 
stockpiles, which were already far higher than normal as air travel 
nose-dived and a recession set in after the September 11th attacks. 
Already down 30% lower since the September attacks, prices have 
dropped further after the API report showed total crude and product 
inventories rising to their highest level since August 1999. Many 
doubt OPEC's ability to maintain its modest level of quota discipline 
after it and rival exporters agreed to cut almost 2 million bpd from 
the worlds supplies. Traders are concerned that if January supply 
figures showed that producers have not cut back as much as they 
promised, confidence in the agreement could quickly disintegrate. 
Heating oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX fell $0.0176 
to $0.5145 per gallon. February gasoline futures on the NYMEX lost 
$0.0224 to $0.5361 per gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for 
March delivery were down $0.62 to $18.41 per barrel.

New Trinidad Oil Field

     Trinidad and Tobago will receive between $2.6 billion and $3.5 
billion from a major oil find there by BHP Billiton. When the oil 
field comes on stream in 2004, BHP hopes to double current local oil 
production of 100,000 bpd over its life cycle which he estimates at 
17 years. Minimum reserves are around 300 million barrels. BHP plans 
to invest $500 million over the next few years to develop the Greater 
Angostura field off the northeast coast.

Unions Urge Senate to Pass Energy Bill 

    Several major trade unions have joined the president in urging 
the Senate to pass an energy bill that allows drilling in the Arctic 
National Wildlife Refuge. The unions favor the bill because of the 
large number of jobs it will create for their workers. The Senate 
majority leader has said the chamber, which is controlled by 
Democrats, will take up energy legislation later this month. 
Democrats favor another plan to triple the amount renewable power in 
use and outlaw the use of the additive MTBE in gasoline within 4 
years. Some Democratic senators have vowed to prevent the bill from 
passing. One senator has suggested the use parliamentary procedures 
to prevent the Senate from even considering ANWR exploration. The 
presidents of the Teamsters Union and United Brotherhood of 
Carpenters are pushing senate leaders to pass the presidents bill in 
the first week of February, and have criticized the Senate for 
politicizing the energy legislation. A 10-year old study by the API 
concluded that ANWR drilling could create up to 700,000 new jobs. 
However, critics of drilling in the refuge put the number at a much 
lower 46,000 jobs and called the API study bogus. Foreign oil imports 
accounts for 57% of the nations supply. The 16 billion barrels of oil 
the Arctic refuge may hold would be enough crude to replace Iraqi 
exports for 70 years, according to Republicans. The energy bill 
passed by the Republican-controlled House would also give $33.5 
billion in tax breaks and incentives to oil and coal companies.

Suncor 4th Quarter Profits Drop
  

    Suncor Energy has reported that earnings dropped by 77% in profit 
for the 4th quarter, citing higher than expected start-up costs for 
its oil sands expansion and falling oil and natural gas prices. 
Suncor's report led off what is expected to be the industry's weakest 
Canadian quarter in about two years. Fourth quarter profits were C$26 
million, or C$0.09 per share, falling from C$111 million, or C$0.46 
per share a year earlier. Cash flow fell 38% to C$133 million, from 
C$216 million in the 4th quarter of 2000. Revenues of C$883 million, 
were down 5% from C$927 million. Suncor is known for its oil sands 
mining and synthetic crude processing operation in Alberta. The 
company completed its 4-year, C$3.4 billion Project Millennium, which 
almost doubled production to 225,000 bpd at the end of last year. 
Suncor says that with Project Millennium completed, it can now focus 
on getting back to basics in 2002. Results were also affected by a 
36% drop in refining margins, which erased net earnings at its Sunoco 
gasoline station division. Last week Suncor warned of a dip in profit 
because of cost overruns associated with its oil sand expansion. Oil 
sands production averaged 153,000 bpd in the 4th quarter, up from 
110,000 a year ago. The company expects average first-quarter output 
of about 200,000 bpd and full-year production of 210,000 bpd. Suncor 
also expects cash operating costs for 2002 of C$10 to C$10.50 per 
barrel, it said. For 2001, net earnings rose 3% to C$388 million, or 
C$1.63 per share, from C$377 million, or C$1.58 per share, due to an 
increase in production, and higher natural gas prices and retail 
margins earlier in the year.

Kinder Morgan Beats 4th Quarter and Yearly Estimates

    Kinder Morgan has posted a 4th quarter net income of $72.4 
million, or $0.60 per share, beating the forecast for earnings of 
$0.55 per share. In 2000, it had earnings of $55.3 million, or $0.43 
per share. However, total operating profits slid to $288.6 million 
from $905.7 million in the 4th quarter of 2000. The company said 
earnings were due to KMI's ownership of the general partner of Kinder 
Morgan Energy Partners, which reported 4th-quarter earnings of $120.7 
million, or $0.40 per unit, easily beating the forecast for earnings 
of $0.39 per unit The partnership made $77.1 million, or $0.34  per 
unit, a year ago. KMPs net income for last year was $251.9 million 
pretax compared to $113.3 million a year ago.

Enterprise Acquires Diamond-Koch's Liquid Storage Business

    Enterprise Products Partners has acquired a natural gas liquids 
and petrochemical liquids storage business from Diamond-Koch for $129 
million in cash. The storage facilities consist of 30 salt dome 
storage caverns with a total permitted capacity of 77 million 
barrels. The facilities provide storage services for mixed natural 
gas liquids, ethane, propane, butanes, natural gasoline and olefins, 
such as ethylene, polymer grade propylene, chemical grade propylene 
and refinery grade propylene. The caverns are located in Mont 
Belvieu, Texas. The acquisition should provide annual cash accretion 
to our partners of $0.12 per unit on a fully diluted basis.
