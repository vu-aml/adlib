Today's FT (page 6 of the European edition) reports fully and faithfully about
the debt management via swaps of the Italian Treasury, and about the Yen
transaction that was apparently singled out in the ISMA study. Eurostat has
always been aware of the transactions, that have been specifically approved. I
attach a Bloomberg release on the issue. It is interesting that the ISMA study
is no longer available on ISMA web site. Also, I don't see in today's news any
trace of the press conference announced in the ISMA press release.

    (ANSA) - Rome, November 6 - Italy's State Auditor General                   
Andrea Monorchio today said he was "deeply offended" by                         
allegations in the foreign press that Italy had "juggled the                    
books" in order to qualify for European Monetary Union (EMU)at                  
the end of the 1990s.                                                           
     The allegations, appearing in Britain's Financial Times and                
The Guardian, as well as the Wall Street Journal, involved                      
Italy's use of a currency swap to "disguise" the exact amount of                
its deficit in order to meet the parameters to join the euro.                   
  According to Monorchio, these allegations were "mental                        
masturbation."                                                                  
     Yesterday's press reports were based on a report by the                    
International Securities Market Association (ISMA), a                           
self-regulatory organization, and the Council on Foreign                        
Relations, an independent US-research group, in which a case was                
outlined where a European country appeared to have used the                     
derivatives market to hide the exact size of its budget deficit.                
     Although Italy was never named in the report, the FT said,                 
the report cited a case in which a 1995 bond issue was used in a                
1997 currency swap aimed at temporarily reducing a country's                    
budget deficit. This example, the FT said, coincided exactly                    
with what happened with Italy's 1995 200 billion yen bond issue.                
     Italy's qualification for EMU was orchestrated by                          
then-Premier Romano Prodi, now president of the European                        
Commission, and then-Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi,                    
Italy's current head of state.                                                  
     "I am deeply offended," Monorchio said on the sidelines of                 
a meeting here with the Industrialists Union, "I worked very                    
long and hard with Ciampi. We closed 1997 with a spending                       
deficit of 2.7% (of GDP) because the European Union would not                   
allow us to calculate nine trillion lire in revenue from the                    
sale of gold reserves. Otherwise our budget deficit would have                  
been, according to Eurostat, 2.4-2.5%."                                         
     After recalling that the EU yesterday was quick to deny                    
that Italy had in any way juggled its books, Monorchio added                    
"Can anyone seriously imagine someone like President Ciampi                     
involved in such skulduggery?"                                                  
     "I myself am just a simple accountant and intend to remain                 
one," he concluded.
