>Tax Cuts Are the Best Stimulus
>
>
>By R. Glenn Hubbard
>
>Washington Post
>Friday, November 16, 2001; Page A47
>
>
>With most indicators of economic production, such as employment and 
>purchasing, showing further decline in October, some have argued that 
>President Bush's growth plan would have little stimulative effect. They 
>prefer the Senate Democrats' plan, on the grounds that spending is a better 
>way to revive the economy.
>
>Permit me to differ. The president's plan, included in the stimulus plan 
>passed by the House, addresses the nation's underlying economic problems. 
>If enacted, the tax cuts will quickly deliver a boost to move the economy 
>back toward its long-run growth path. The plan, it is estimated, would 
>result in 300,000 more jobs and add half a percentage point to the 2002 
>growth rate.
>
>Here's how tax cuts help stimulate the economy. Tax cuts for individuals 
>give them more money to spend and invest. Tax cuts for business for three 
>years -- long enough to have a serious effect -- would make investment less 
>expensive, so businesses would be encouraged to buy equipment, increase 
>production and expand employment.
>
>It is a major fallacy to praise new spending plans as "stimulus." This 
>ignores the fact that a dollar spent by the government is one fewer that 
>can be spent by private businesses. Furthermore, new spending programs 
>almost never go away, and they lead to more inflexible regulation of the 
>economy. New spending programs are not only unlikely to make the economy 
>grow, they also are an undesirable response to terrorism risks.
>
>Instead, it is important to take advantage of the flexibility and 
>innovation of the private sector. This will reduce the negative effects on 
>job growth as part of our necessary response to terrorism.
>
>The real underlying economic problem is that the terrorist attacks took a 
>direct toll on the economy and, more important, on the confidence of 
>American households and firms. The combined effect tipped a fragile rate of 
>economic growth into negative territory. But the attacks did not undermine 
>long-term productivity growth, so economic fundamentals remain strong.
>
>The challenge is simply to restore the health of the economy quickly. And 
>Congress needs to do so in the way that will be most beneficial. Assistance 
>for dislocated workers is important, and the president has already proposed 
>an aggressive package to provide it. But spending should not be confused 
>with economic stimulus.
>
>The basic source of uncertainty and loss of consumer confidence is fear 
>over job loss, and the fact is that additional spending, even on 
>unemployment insurance won't give people jobs. Indeed, the excessive 
>expansion of unemployment insurance proposed by the Senate would actually 
>increase unemployment, because it would discourage job applicants from 
>accepting new positions. Moreover, the Senate bill would err by raising 
>taxes on employers -- exactly the wrong thing to do at this moment.
>
>Until one addresses the underlying source of the uncertainty, there will be 
>no guarantee that hemorrhaging federal dollars will do any good. Lower tax 
>rates are the best way to create jobs and make large and small businesses 
>grow. Acceleration of future tax cuts, which Congress has already chosen, 
>will help the economy.
>
>Despite the repeated claim that only poor households will spend additional 
>income, evidence indicates almost all households spend about the same 
>percentage of their tax cuts. Business tax relief is essential because it 
>encourages firms to expand investment and employment. With tax cuts, firms 
>would be able to replace existing machines with more productive ones, 
>precisely the kind of change that frees up funds to hire more workers.
>
>The economy needs help now. The president wants to create more jobs, while 
>the Senate proposes new entitlements. If you were unemployed, which would 
>you prefer?
>
