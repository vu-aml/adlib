Dear all,

Commodities Now Magazine would like your help!!

To acknowledge the development of the role of women in industry, Commodities
Now, in association with Linda Rader and sponsors Accenture and Jacobs
Consultancy, is honouring women in the energy industry who have made an
exceptional contribution to their marketplace. Commodities Now will host a
survey and awards ceremony to honour the women YOU nominate. Winners and
honourees are not selected based on the number of votes they receive but
instead on the strength of the nomination. So, each one counts.

The awards ceremony will be held at the E-World of Energy conference in
Essen in February 2002. The results will also be published in the December
issue of Commodities Now.

Nominations can be for women working in ANY sector of the energy industry
globally, in any job, with honours being given for the display of particular
characteristics or skills in their work.

To nominate a candidate, fill in the form at www.commodities-now.com
Alternatively, print out the attached PDF file and complete the 5 steps
listed. Return the form as instructed.

Make sure we receive your nomination by October 31st.

Thank you for your support.

Regards,
Charlotte James
