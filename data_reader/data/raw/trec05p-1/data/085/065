Chris,

When Mary matched up the names & P numbers on the license list with the ETS roster you ran as of 10/9/01, 344 names fell out as not matching.  Can you run an ETS roster for me that is as of 9/17?  This presumably will have fewer fall outs since they "match in time."  There will be other situations to deal with but this would help.  If you cannot get the data as of a certain date I will review the list for the names I know and assign them to a company.  Then Mary will distribute the others based on the distribution of the larger population.

Thanks,
Greg

Unfortunately, I didn't keep track of the run date, but the date on the reports is probably reflective of the run date.

Mary,

Chris Schlaudraff with the ISC gathered the statistics and developed the calculations.  The supporting data for the documents and master data I believe is as of 8/14/01 and the users/licenses are as of 9/17/01 (is this correct Chris?).  This is the "snapshot" that was used in calculating ETS' share of the support costs.  The ETS roster which Chris ran for us and I mailed you yesterday is as of 10/9/01.  That is, it indicates who is in what company as of 10/9/01.  Is that correct Chris?

	Greg,
	Several of the legal entities you have used in calculating the ETS allocation for ISC costs are no longer active companies.  All the employees are with another company.  You will need to refigure your matrix when I have gone through the list and identified which company the users work for.
