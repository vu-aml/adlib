Neartown neighbors,

Now talking w/ Reliant-HL&P folks. Pushing for a community meeting w/ a presentation of their plans in Montrose. Will be this month, will know more this week.

Want to avoid pre-packaged p.r. put-offs, I prefer an open give & take session w/ them and the community in one room.

  1.. What I need from you in anticipation of this event are questions. What information do we want? What do we need to know? What do we want them to do? 
  2.. Call, e-mail, fax or snail-mail me or your community leader now!
With too many fish to fry on one burner, I cannot think of everything, and need your help in making the most of this opportunity.

What I've heard from other sources........
.....Reliant-HL&P is progressing through a 10 year plan that's in place now.
My question...Where's the community imput?

.....Haven't seen it yet, but this is from a highly credible & sober source....the big poles already in place along Dunlavy. Follow the lines & poles south of the SW Freeway, then the lines go underground at North & South Blvds, then come back up again. My question....How come there, and not Montrose?

Respond to the #1 and #2 now. Be nice.
