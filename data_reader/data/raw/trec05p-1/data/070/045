David,
Legal reviewed your concern with referencing the upstream contract; and
they came up with the following paragraph.  One additional change, let's
use the word "discount" versus "credit"...this works better with our
tariff.  Let me know if this will work.  Thanks.

For the term of this Amendment, Transwestern agrees to provide an
additional discount 
to the Shipper for quantities that could not be scheduled hereunder due
to an event of Force Majeure, as reasonably determined by Transwestern,
rendering the supplies unavailable.  The additional discount will be an
amount equal to any quantities made unavailable multiplied by the
Discounted Rate.

David,
Here is Legal's spin on the amendment...can you guys work with this?  Do
you know the upstream contract number?  Thanks.

For the term of this Amendment, Transwestern agrees to provide a credit
to the Shipper for quantities that could not be scheduled hereunder due
to an event of Force Majeure, as reasonably determined by Transwestern,
on Contract No. ___ (upstream contract) rendering the supplies
unavailable.  The amount of the credit will be calculated by multiplying
the quantities made unavailable by the Discounted Rate.

Michelle,

Here is a quick paragraph that I think addresses the Force Majuere
issue.  Joe 
is out this afternoon and may inject his thoughts so let's touch base on

Monday.  Have a good weekend, I hope the dentist was kind!

Best Regards
David


7.	For the term of this Amendment, Transwestern agrees to provide a
credit 
to the Shipper for quantities made unavailable due to an event of Force
Majuere 
declared solely by Transwestern.  The amount of the credit will be
calculated 
by multiplying the quantities made unavailable by the Discounted Rate.
