The greatest education in the world is watching the masters at work.
Nor mourn the unalterable Days That Genius goes and Folly stays
Thou must be emptied of that wherewith thou art full, that thou mayest be filled with that whereof thou art empty.

The tragedy of life is what dies inside a man while he lives.
The great questions of the day will not be settled by means of speeches and majority decisions but by iron and blood.
Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored.Man is made by his belief. As he believes, so he is.
Speak the affirmative; emphasize your choice by utter ignoring of all that you reject
