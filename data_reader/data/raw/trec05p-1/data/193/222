Shelley, Dynegy will be here on Monday to meet with the commercial group, and will need the conference room on 42 all day.  I'm looking for a location to have your staff meeting from 11:00 until 12:00 and will let you know if I'm successful.

The group is too large to have this meeting in your office.  Do you have any problem having this meeting off the floor?

Thank you, Ricki
