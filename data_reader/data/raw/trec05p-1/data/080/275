Dear Jeff,

How are you? Hope you had a nice weekend. Will you be kind enough to give me some idea of the schedule after you talk to the head of Japan today? I can assure you I will do a good job there. 

Will you please go to the Wharton undergrad reception next Monday? They will love to have you there. I am going too, let's have more fun!

All the best!

Li
