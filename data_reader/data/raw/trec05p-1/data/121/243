A revised model of the project is in the shared driver. Please check "Iteration" (under Tools-Options-Calculation in Excel) and put Max Interation at 200 before you open the file. 

For "Cost of Service" page, we now have $0.70 for traditional rate and $0.59 for levelized rate. We are still $0.16 away from Foothills $0.43 but we believe we know what accounts for $0.11 difference; if we use Foothills assumptions, the levelized rate would go down to $0.48. However, Foothills pro forma model has some questionable assumptions (e.g. 0% Opex and Capex escalation). I will send you (Mary Kay) assumptions comparison sheet in separate mail. I still couldn't reconcile the $0.05 difference.

If anyone has any comments or questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

JB
