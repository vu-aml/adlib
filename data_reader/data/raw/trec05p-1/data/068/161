The list looks good.  Let me just make sure my understanding of the titles is correct...

Lara,

We are finalizing a Broker Client deal with the referenced companies.  We are giving them access to European Gas, European Power, European Weather, European Bandwidth, European Coal and Brent Crude.  Is it appropriate to use the following as the exhibit for this transaction?  

UK and European Gas
UK and European Power [McKinney, Lara]   - In this case 'European Power' does NOT include Nordic Power? 
European Coal [McKinney, Lara]   - Do you mean ONLY European Coal and do not want to include US as well?  
European Weather [McKinney, Lara]   In this case 'European Weather' does NOT included Nordic Weather? 
European Bandwidth [McKinney, Lara]   There is an initiative to launch Asian Bandwidth products.  This is a ways from launch yet, but do you want it included? 
Brent Crude [McKinney, Lara]   This one is pretty broad - since you have not listed a country, can I assume that you mean US, UK, and Asian Brent products?
