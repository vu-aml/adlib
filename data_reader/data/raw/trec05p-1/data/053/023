No, Alliant only agreed to pay for the commodity and cashout imbalance invoices for the previous 6 months (which they did).  They sent Northern a letter stating they disputed our collection beyond the 6 month GISB window.  I had worked with Kathy Washington and Dan Fancler to make sure the $932,585 would be placed in suspense versus showing up as a receivable on our books.

I am still working with Dari and Shelly on a letter to be sent to Alliant which addresses the GISB standards and the fact Northern believes they are responsible for the invoices.

Lynn, regarding the letters that you asked me to look over, I thought that they had agreed to pay these invoices.  We currently have on IES's accounts receivable an amount of $932,585.91 which represents $25,342.30 for commodity invoices and $907,243.61 for imbalance invoices.  We have already waived the DDVC invoices of $23,697.36.  If you have any further questions, just let me know.

Thanks,

Raetta
