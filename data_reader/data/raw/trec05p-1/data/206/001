Okay, team, here's our first chance to rally for the 2002 tour.  Come join us at Memorial Park (picnic loop area) on Saturday, January 26, from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM.  This is the MS150 Training Program Kick-Off and Bike Demo Day.

Team Sun & Ski will have a booth at the event.  Please come and visit us.  You can register, ask questions, or just say hi.  I know you have lots of questions about the new team, and this will be your chance to meet those individuals from Sun & Ski Sports who have made it possible for our team to stay together this year.  

We will have some trainers available, and would like some volunteers to do some stationary riding in the area of our booth.  If you'd like to do this, please come equipped.  We'll probably have some bikes also, but if you could throw your own in, that would be helpful.  You can get a free safety check-up on your current bike, or shop for a new bike or the latest cycling gear.  Official MS150 Health Clubs will be on hand to give training tips and advice.

I'm looking forward to seeing you there!
