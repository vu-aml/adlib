THE GRIDIRON GURU

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions 
about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We 
invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on 
players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance 
to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like 
yourself! 

Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI: I am stuck on my last starter. 
Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty 
Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he 
is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should 
be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the 
season.

G.G.: Alexander has been a revelation in his first two 
starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to 
him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not 
be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and 
Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who 
may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker 
will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not 
destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a 
great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score 
a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a 
Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.

Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA: Should I start Rod Gardner or 
Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is 
looking better each week.

G.G.: Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains 
instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be 
geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The 
Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of 
the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is 
quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants' 
No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing 
Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week. 
Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with 
Hilliard because of his experience and continuing 
improvement.

John Kersey, Denver, CO: I have already decided to start 
LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB - 
Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?

G.G: Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but 
the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in 
him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas 
after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a 
respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a 
Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against 
the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with 
the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.

TIP OF THE WEEK:

Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is 
a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions 
override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in 
the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the 
Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle. 
And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be 
surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.
