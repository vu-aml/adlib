Please get together and make sure that the deferred taxes are moved to the correct entities, reflecting where the reserves are.

Patty,  The $20 MM Sales Tax Accrual was originally recorded to 986, acct 30113000.  We transferred $5 MM in January 2001 for the PX Credit Reserve.  This month (Sept 2001) we moved $10 MM from this acct to the Bonus Accrual on 985.  I don't know the status of the remaining $4.5 MM left in the Taxes Payable -Other acct.

I think we have found the account - but it looks like this has been transferred to 985 from 986.  Can you provide us with the entries for both companies and let me know when you plan on taking this to the income statement - if you plan on doing this?

Thanks,

Patty

Todd,
Can you please provide Patty with the company and account number where the yearend sales tax accrual is recorded.  They are going to start making payments against the accrual.  Is the balance still at the original $15MM?
