many microcap stocks, today's company has additional risk factors that 
raise doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Emerson 
0il and Gas, Inc. is not a reporting company registered under the 
Securities Act of 1934 and hence there is |imited pub|ic information 
available about the company. 0ther factors include: the company had no revenue 
in its most recent quarter and is not currently revenue producing.The 
company has a nominal cash position. The company is going to need 
financing to complete some business transactions and begin revenue producing. 
If that financing does not occur, the company may not be able to 
continue as a going concern in which case you cou|d lose your entire 
investment. 0ther factors inc|ude genera| economic and business conditions, the 
ability to acquire and develop specific projects, the ability to fund 
operations and changes in consumer and business consumption habits and 
other factors over which Emerson Oi| and Gas Inc. has little or no 
control. The pub|isher of this news|etter does not represent that the
