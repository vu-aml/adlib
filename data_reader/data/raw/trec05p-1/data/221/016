Louise, 

We have been trying to get something arranged for this Friday.  UBS has special events personnel that arrange these types of events including what we saw at the Houstonian a few weeks ago.  It is my understanding that we are awaiting approval from Mike Hutchins before making any arrangements.  Informally, I have spoken with Jillian's and Sambuca regarding availability for a Friday afternoon event.  However, absent using yours or Greg's credit card, we will need approval through UBS prior to booking any formal event.

Kind regards,
Julie

So I have a couple of people in my team trying to organise something for Friday. Would either or both of you be game to do a floor talk, presuming we have closed?

For the shin-dig we'll have on Friday (if Hutch approves), do you thing we could get John, Louise, and Greg to say a word?
