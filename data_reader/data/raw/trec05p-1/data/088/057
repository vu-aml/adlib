        Jeanne,  I understand from Keith Melville that you were looking for 
various pieces of SDG&E's May 18, 2001 filing in our Revenue Shortfall 
Surcharge Application (A.00-10-045/A.01-01-044).  I have included in the 
attached note the entire SDG&E filing.  Hopefully, you will be able to find 
in the package the information/data you are seeking.  Recognize that there 
were some corrections made on the stand by some of the witnesses.  I would 
recommend that you check the transcript for those corrections. 

        Also, Keith tells me you also wanted a copy of Exhibit #38.  Jim Hay

will send it to you in a separate e-mail. 

        Please let us know, if you need further documents in this 
proceeding.  Have a great day!

Attached is the first of three emails with SDG&E's filing  updating the DWR
revenue requirements.   The following is an excerpt from our pleading.  In
the next email are scenarios that show DWR surcharge (cents per kWh for
system, large customers, and small customers)  under assumptions requested
by the ALJ.    

Thanks especially to Ed Fong, Mohamed Derbas, Bill Saxe, Mike Strong, Keith
Melville, and Jeff Parrot for key assistance in getting this filing out in
one-day. 

Based on this filing,  the Commission may (we have no Proposed Decision yet)
rule as soon as August 23 on an increase to SDG&E rates of approximately
3-cents to recover the updated DWR revenue requirements.  

If you have questions, please contact me, Lynn Van Wagenen, or Keith
Melville. 

Excerpt of SDG&E pleading: 

	On August 15, 2001, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Wetzell issued an
"ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE'S RULING ON THE AUGUST 7, 2001 REVENUE REQUIREMENT
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES" directing San Diego Gas & Electric
Company (SDG&E) to produce updated estimates, including supporting analyses,
of the system average electric rate increases required based on the revised
revenue requirements determined by the Department of Water Resources' (DWR),
as set forth in the August 7, 2001 DWR communication to the California
Public Utilities Commission.

This and the following two e-mails contain the updated information requested
by ALJ Wetzell in his Ruling dated August 15, 2001.  The documents are
spread out over three e-mails because they consist primarily of
spreadsheets.   In this first e-mail SDG&E attaches its pleading responding
to ALJ Wetzell's Ruling along with two documents providing the assumptions
SDG&E used for its updates to Exhibits 14 and 18 and  a document providing a
summary of all of SDG&E's updated analyses.  In the second e-mail SDG&E will
provide its updates to Exhibit 14 and in the third e-mail SDG&E will provide
its updates to Exhibit 18.

Subject:        FW: Reply of SDG&E to ALJ Wetzell's Ruling of August 15,
2001 in A.00-10-045/A.01-01-044 

Attached is the first of three emails with SDG&E's filing  updating the DWR
revenue requirements.   The following is an excerpt from our pleading.  In
the next email are scenarios that show DWR surcharge (cents per kWh for
system, large customers, and small customers)  under assumptions requested
by the ALJ.    

Thanks especially to Ed Fong, Mohamed Derbas, Bill Saxe, Mike Strong, Keith
Melville, and Jeff Parrot for key assistance in getting this filing out in
one-day. 

Based on this filing,  the Commission may (we have no Proposed Decision yet)
rule as soon as August 23 on an increase to SDG&E rates of approximately
3-cents to recover the updated DWR revenue requirements.  

If you have questions, please contact me, Lynn Van Wagenen, or Keith
Melville. 

Excerpt of SDG&E pleading: 

	On August 15, 2001, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Wetzell issued an
"ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE'S RULING ON THE AUGUST 7, 2001 REVENUE REQUIREMENT
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES" directing San Diego Gas & Electric
Company (SDG&E) to produce updated estimates, including supporting analyses,
of the system average electric rate increases required based on the revised
revenue requirements determined by the Department of Water Resources' (DWR),
as set forth in the August 7, 2001 DWR communication to the California
Public Utilities Commission.

This and the following two e-mails contain the updated information requested
by ALJ Wetzell in his Ruling dated August 15, 2001.  The documents are
spread out over three e-mails because they consist primarily of
spreadsheets.   In this first e-mail SDG&E attaches its pleading responding
to ALJ Wetzell's Ruling along with two documents providing the assumptions
SDG&E used for its updates to Exhibits 14 and 18 and  a document providing a
summary of all of SDG&E's updated analyses.  In the second e-mail SDG&E will
provide its updates to Exhibit 14 and in the third e-mail SDG&E will provide
its updates to Exhibit 18.
