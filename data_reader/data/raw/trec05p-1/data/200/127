Hi Folks,

Took a Power Nap after sending out our last update in week 17 and just woke
up... :)    Actually, I've been pouring myself into the "other" job (the one
that pays the bills and makes this one possible) getting ready for the boat
show season (www.bryantboats.com)  Also reintroduced myself to my wife and
kids.

I know you're busy with your own stuff but wanted to drop one more email in
your box this season and say thanks for letting us serve you this year at
Footballguys.com.  It's truly been a blast.  I can remember one night this
Summer as David and I were "discussing" (a nice word for "yelling at each
other") the VBD App on a Tuesday night about 4 am.  I looked at the clock
and said, "We've got to be the dumbest guys in the world staying up all
night to do this".  He paused and said, "Yeah, but it's FUN, isn't it?"   I
had to agree it is.

I won't get sappy, but looking back on our season, it's pretty clear a lot
has happened since last Spring when we started mailing these updates.  In a
weird way, we sort of came through some of that stuff together.   That's
cool.

David and I have said all along that the strength of the site lies in the
people that visit and support it and we truly believe that.   Feedback from
you folks helped shape the site significantly.  Input / comments / death
threats from you greatly helped us in creating the VBD Draft App.  A large
number of our Breaking News Updates were stories that one of you sent me and
I'd in turn pass along to the 33,000+ people on the email list.  I tried to
operate on the philosophy of "You'll Know What I Know" sending you the
stories usually seconds after I received them.   Our message boards on the
site were another invaluable source for information and community.

Very simply: The site rocked because you guys rocked.

And for that, we wanted to say thanks for allowing us to be a small part of
your Fantasy Football Season.

Over the next several months, we'll be hammering out what improvements we
can make for 2002 and subscribers to this list will be the first to know
what's up.

Thanks again and we sincerely wish you and yours all the best in everything.

Joe and David
