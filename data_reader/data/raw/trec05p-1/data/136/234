Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Crédit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila
