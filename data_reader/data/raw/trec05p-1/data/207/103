In response to where to charge your time to for TW projects, Jim Saunders prefers that you charge directly if possible.  Let me know if we need to discuss.

this will allocate their charges to all tw projects...of course red rock dominates tw capital expenditures
a direct charge to a red rock w/o would be ideal

The TW commercial and regulatory team are charging to the TW overhead WO for their time related to TW projects including Red Rock.  Is this how you think we should be handling?
