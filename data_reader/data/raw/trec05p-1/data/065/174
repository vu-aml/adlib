Natural Gas Cash and Futures Continue to Slide Lower





    Natural gas for November delivery on the NYMEX closed down $0.009 Friday at $2.244 per MMBtu, trading between $2.205-2.28 after closing unchanged on Thursday and reaching a new contract low of $2.18 Wednesday. The December contract dipped $0.002 to $2.622 per MMBtu. The NYMEX will continue to trade in abbreviated session this week. Last week the AGA reported storage inventories rose by 91 Bcf for the prior week, well above the year-ago gain of 67 Bcf and the 5-year average injection of 77 Bcf. Total inventories of 2.848 Tcf are 446 Bcf, or 19% above last year, 264 Bcf above the 5-year average, and now stand at 86% full. The National Weather Service continues to call for below normal temperatures for the Eastern half of the nation and above normal in most of the West this week. Anticipated first-of-month cash indexes for October are $0.70 - $0.90 below September's indexes at the pipelines. Spreads between cash and futures widen considerably with much more incremental demand expected next month as some utilities switch to natural gas from fuel oil and a number of nuclear energy sites go off-line for maintenance. Currently, there is about $0.50 per MMBtu difference between October cash and November futures. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally down $0.05 - $0.10 Friday, except out West where spot prices traded higher. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub dropped $0.07 to $1.82 per MMBtu.

Exelon Cuts 3rd Quarter Forecast



    Exelon says 3rd quarter profit will be about a 25% less than forecast because the company misjudged demand for electricity. Exelon's shares fell 12% Friday. Exelon expects to earn $1.10 - $1.20 per share, instead of $1.57 forecast by Wall Sreet. Exelon originally said it would earn $1.35 -$1.80. Electricity use by manufacturers has slowed along with the economy, and a milder-than-expected summer reduced demand.

FERC Wants to Increase Industry Monitoring





    The new chairman of the FERC wants to increase the Commission's ability to monitor energy sales in order to prevent abuses rather than just react to complaints. The commission has asked Congress to approve over $1.3 million for the addition of 10 senior level officials to monitor energy sales and actively look for market abuses. The agency currently has 50 people assigned to enforcement. The chairman says that even though the market has been moving towards deregulation for 10 years, the commission has not adjusted its examinations. The FERC is asking Congress to give it more authority to impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation, per day. Violators could lose the ability to base rates on market prices and be forced to charge only approved rates. The Electric Power Supply Association says members aren't afraid of additional market monitoring so long as it doesn't cross the line into political interventions every time there is a market fluctuation. High prices don't necessarily mean markets aren't working and can provide signals the market needs more power supply or a demand response.

Midwest Utilities Combine into Transmission Entity



     Six Midwest power companies have applied with the FERC to form a new entity to merge their electric transmission systems. The new transmission company will be called Translink Transmission. It will be a for-profit company set up as part of FERC's 1999 order that investor-owned utilities join a RTO by the end of this year. The FERC has made RTOs a top priority since the California power crisis.  RTOs establish common rules that allow utilities to smoothly trade bulk power across the borders of their own local transmission systems. Applicants for Translink Transmission consist of IES Utilities and Iowa and Interstate Power; Iowa's Corn Belt Power Cooperative; MidAmerican Energy; Nebraska Public Power District; Omaha Public Power District; and Xcel Energy. The utilities will participate in Translink through a combination of divestiture, leases and operating agreements.  Translink will manage 26,000 miles of transmission lines and about 35,500 MW to about 6.9 million utility customers in 14 states. It expects to be in business by the end of next year. The new transmission company will also contract with the Midwest ISO for RTO services.  Separately, a Canada's Manitoba Hydro has joined Midwest ISO. The agreement is the first international extension of a US based ISO. Manitoba Hydro has 5,200 MW of mostly hydroelectric power generation and provides energy to all of Manitoba except central Winnipeg. The coordination agreement allows the utility to participate in the ISO without violating Canadian law, which prevents Manitoba Hydro from signing the Midwest ISO's transmission owners' agreement. Manitoba and the Midwest ISO are both part of Mid-Continent Area Power Pool.

California Generators Want Payment Plan 



    Five large power generators have contacted Southern California Edison in an attempt to find out how much, when and if they will be paid for electricity sold to the utility. Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy, Enron and Puget Sound Energy say they have received little assurance that the SCE intends to work out a payment plan with its creditors if the California legislature fails to pass a rescue plan. State senators adjourned last month without approving a $2.9 billion rescue package. The governor has called special session later this month to consider a bail-out, however it is unlikely the lawmakers will pass the measure in its present form. The current version of the plan does not allow SCE to use bonds sold under the measure to pay the generators. Since SCE supported that version of the plan, the generators want to know how they will be paid. An attorney for the companies says they want a simple yes or no to whether or not SCE is interested in negotiating a forbearance agreement. The generators contend that SCE can take steps to ensure that all creditor classes are treated equally, and payments can be made from existing funds or from a sale of secured bonds.
