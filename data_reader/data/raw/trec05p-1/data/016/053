Hello, 
Listen, I know you don't know me directly but you recently submitted a =
request, letting me know that you are interested in receiving information =
about working from home.
I think this might appeal to you.
So, if I could show you a way to build your business from home on the =
Internet regardless of your experience, would it be worth 7 minutes to check =
it out? 
This is a completely turnkey marketing system that does 90% of the work for =
you; it's totally set up ready to go to work for you right now.
This company is Inc 500 ranked, and they've thought of everything. 
You've got to see this:

Just set aside just 7 minutes of your time to really give this your full =
attention, then reply to this email and let me know what you think!
I'll be here to answer any questions you have.
All the best.

Steve Wilson

PS - I'll be honest with you, I was skeptical at first, but that quickly =
changed. 
You'll see why soon! You can evaluate this entire opportunity and have access =
to everything, FREE for a week.
