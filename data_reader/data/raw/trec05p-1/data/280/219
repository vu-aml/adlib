DR PAUL KAZIM
GENERAL HOSPITAL
JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA 
 
ATTENTION; MANAGING DIRECTOR/C.E.O,
 
Forgive me if this comes to you as a surprise because we do
not know each other in person. I got your address from a
friend of mine working at the South Africa chamber of
commerce who assure me that you are a person of
respectable character,
 
I am DR PAUL KAZIM, a general practitioner attached at the
Johannesburg General Hospital, South Africa. I have very
important information I wish to share with you. On the
24th of MARCH 2004, we admitted a patient with terminal
stage of brain cancer. It was found on examination that
the cancer has metastasized extensively and that the woman
had no chances of survival. Thus our medical team informed
the patient that her death would be a matter of weeks. I
was assigned to manage this patient and I was able to have
her history and eventually developed friendship with her.
 It was then that I learnt from the woman that she was
married to MOBUTO SESE SEKO, the former president of ZAIRE,
who was the richest man in Africa before he died. Her name
is MRS AGNES SESE SEKO, the fourth wife of the late
president of Zaire. 
 
Since the death of her husband, she came to South Africa
with her only son where they were granted political asylum
by the government of South Africa few days before MRS
 SESE SEKO dies, she informed me of the money her late
husband deposited for her in a private security company
here in South Africa. He begged me to collect this money
and transfer it to a trust account overseas for her only
son who is only 10 years now. She told me how she has no
living relation capable of taking care of her only son and
how she would not want her son to live in Africa. She
therefore begged me to do something within my powers to
 send her son to an Overseas country where he will live a
safe life and have a quality education as well as Where
his Muslim faith will be preserved. She told me that the
amount of money involved is US$ 30,000,000.00 (THIRTY
MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS). The money is currently
deposited as diplomatic consignment in a private security
company here in Johannesburg, South Africa. Before she
died, MRS SESE SEKOO handed me over all the documents to
collect the money from the Security Company. She also
signed a transfer of ownership transferring the ownership
of the money to me. I have cross ? checked with the
security company and have confirmed that the money is
intact and safe in the security company. MRS SESE SEKO
then agreed that her son and me will share the money after
the death If I agree to help her.
 
This is why I am contacting you. I shall want you to
assist me transfer this money to an overseas country where
we can deposit this money for her son in a safe bank
account according to MRS SESE SEKO?S desires. I shall
also want you to assist me to relocate the little boy to
your country even if it means that I will join him with my
family to settle in your country. As of now, the son is
living with my family here in Johannesburg. I beg you to
treat this transaction with high confidentiality. 

The medical board of South Africa will subject me to a
hectic interrogation if they get hold of this information,
which may lead to the money being confiscated. But I must
assure you that this business bears no risk whatsoever. I
have perfected every arrangement to bring about a very
successful transfer in the most legal way. All I require
from you is your co operation. I suggest that when this
money successfully transferred to your account, that we
share the money as follows:
1) 40% OF THE MONEY TO BE KEPT IN BANK ACCOUNTS FOR THE SON
OF MRS SESE SEKO.
2) 25% WILL BE FOR ME.
3) 25% WILL BE FORYOU.
4) 10% TO BE MARKED OUT FOR ANY UNFORSEEN EXPENSES,
On your request, I shall also send you all the documents
relating to this transaction as well as my identification I
shall therefore want you to contact me immediately by phone
or e mail so that all details about this transaction will
be discussed.
Thanks and regards,
