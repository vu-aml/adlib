 Not completely,  it means that we are not going to sign any agreements until we get the nod from appropriate management folks.  We should continue low key development of the agreements as usual, but not execute new docs.  Let's talk about it at our upcoming legal-credit luncheon. ----cgy

I reviewed the version of the USG Coversheet you faxed me (which
originated from USG) and it appears to be in order.  

Were you able to get confirmation from Tonya/Lisa about adding Party B
Affiliates and Parent Entity to the Minimum Cash clause?
