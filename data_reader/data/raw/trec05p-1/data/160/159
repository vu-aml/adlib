Getting setup for TMS Model Office and Production and PLE Production can now be done through ERequest.  You might want to look at it to know what your "customer" will see.  Login to ERequest and select the "Update Account Access" button.  Then select "Applications".  Be sure the Region is set to "ETS".  You can find the TMS and PLE options after you hit the "Show All" button.

Here is how the ERequest is setup to work:
1.  The user makes the request
2.  An email is sent to their manager for approval.  The manager then approves or denies the request.
3.  If the manager approves the request, an email is sent to the security approvers.  The security approvers are:
	for TMS - Maggie (primary), Ramona (secondary)
	for PLE - LInda (primary), Karen (secondary)
Once you click on the link in the email, you will be able to see what company and level of access this person is requesting.  You can also either approve or deny the request.  If you are adding comments (the solution center asks that you please do), be sure the hit the "Add Comments" button.
Please note:  once you click on the request link in the email it is assigned to you.  Please do not click on the link in the email unless you are going to follow through with the entire request.
4.  If the security approver approves the request, an email will be sent to the network team to give the user access.  The security approver above is expected to setup the access within the application.
5.  Once the request is finished, an email will be sent to the user.  If approved, the user will see the application on their start menu the next time he/she reboots.

There may be a few kinks in this process at first, but rest assured it is very easy to make changes.

This new process will be mentioned in tomorrow's ETS Solution Center Change Control items email.  Feel free to contact Lupita Cantu, Glenda Wagner, or Patti Dennis with questions.
