China’s New Economic Model

China's success since it began its transition to a market economy has been
based on adaptable strategies and policies: as each set of problems are
solved, new problems arise, for which new policies and strategies must be
devised.

This process includes social innovation. China recognized that it could not
simply transfer economic institutions that had worked in other countries;
at the least, what succeeded elsewhere had to be adapted to the unique
problems confronting China. Today, China is discussing a "new economic
model." Of course, the old economic model has been a resounding success,
producing almost 10 percent annual growth for 30 years and lifting hundreds
of millions of Chinese out of poverty. The changes are apparent not only in
the statistics, but even more so in the faces of the people that one sees
around the country.

I recently visited a remote Dong village in the mountains of Quizho, one of
China's poorest provinces, miles away from the nearest paved road; yet it
had electricity, and with electricity had come not just television, but the
internet. While some rising incomes came from remittances from family
members who had migrated to coastal cities, the farmers, too, were better
off, with new crops and better seeds: the government was selling, on
credit, high-grade seeds with a guaranteed rate of germination.

China knows that it must change if it is to have sustainable growth. At
every level, there is a consciousness of environmental limits and the
realization that the resource-intensive consumption patterns now accepted
in the United States would be a disaster for China - and for the world. As
an increasing share of China's population moves to cities, those cities
will have to be made livable, which will require careful planning,
including public transportation systems and parks.

Equally interesting, China is attempting to move away from the export-led
growth strategy that it and other East Asian countries have pursued. That
strategy supported technology transfer, helping to close the knowledge gap
and rapidly improving the quality of manufactured goods. Export-led growth
meant that China could produce without worrying about developing the
domestic market.

But a global backlash has already developed. Even countries seemingly
committed to competitive markets don't like being beaten at their own game,
and often trump up charges of "unfair competition." More importantly, even
if markets are not fully saturated in many areas, it will be hard to
maintain double-digit growth rates for exports.

So something has to change. China has been engaged in what might be called
"vendor finance," providing the money that helps finance the huge US fiscal
and trade deficits, allowing Americans to buy more goods than they sell.
But this is a peculiar arrangement: a relatively poor country is helping to
finance America's War on Iraq, as well as a massive tax cut for the richest
people in the world's richest country, while huge needs at home imply ample
room for expansion of both consumption and investment.

In fact, to meet the challenge of restructuring China's economy away from
exports and resource-intensive goods, China must stimulate consumption.
While the rest of the world struggles to raise savings, China, with a
savings rate in excess of 40%, struggles to get its people to consume more.

Providing better social services (public health care, education, and
nation-wide retirement programs) would reduce the need for "precautionary"
savings. More access to finance for small and medium sized businesses would
help, too. And "green taxes" - such as on carbon emissions - would shift
consumption patterns while discouraging energy-intensive exports. As China
moves away from export-led growth, it will have to look for new sources of
dynamism in its growing entrepreneurial ranks, which requires a commitment
to creating an independent innovation system. China has long invested
heavily in higher education and technology; now it is striving to create
world-class institutions.

But if China wants a dynamic innovation system, it should resist pressure
by Western governments to adopt the kind of unbalanced intellectual
property laws that are being demanded.  Instead, it should pursue a
"balanced" intellectual property regime: because knowledge itself is the
most important input in the production of knowledge, a badly designed
intellectual property regime can stifle innovation - as has been the case
in America in some areas.

Western technological innovation has focused too little on reducing the
adverse environmental impact of growth, and too much on saving labor -
something that China has in abundance. So it makes sense for China to focus
its scientific prowess on new technologies that use fewer resources. But it
is important to have an innovation system (including an intellectual
property regime) that ensures that advances in knowledge are widely used.
That may require innovative approaches, quite different from intellectual
property regimes based on privatization and monopolization of knowledge,
with the high prices and restricted benefits that follow.

Too many people think of economics as a zero-sum game, and that China's
success is coming at the expense of the rest of the world. Yes, China's
rapid growth poses challenges to the West. Competition will force some to
work harder, to become more efficient, or to accept lower profits.

But economics is really a positive-sum game. An increasingly prosperous
China has not only expanded imports from other countries, but is also
providing goods that have kept prices lower in the West, despite sharply
higher oil prices in recent years. This downward pressure on prices has
allowed Western central banks to follow expansionary monetary policies,
underpinning higher employment and growth.

We should all hope that China's new economic model succeeds. If it does,
all of us will have much to gain.
