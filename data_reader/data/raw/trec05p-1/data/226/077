DEAR FRIEND,

BEFORE I START, I MUST FIRST APOLOGISE FOR THIS UNSOLICITED MAIL TO 
YOU. I AM AWARE THAT THIS IS CERTAINLY AN UNCONVENTIONAL APPROACH TO 
STARTING A RELATIONSHIP.
 THOUGH YOU MAY HAVE RECIEVED SIMILAR MAIL LIKE THIS, I WOULD WANT YOU 
TO GIVE THIS ONE A GOOD THOUGHT. I CRAVE YOUR MOSTDESIRED INDULGENCE.

I am Dr.Richard Maduka, the Director-General of Nigeria-Delta 
Development Commission(NDDC), constitutionally mandated with the 
responsibility of managing of Niger-Delta Development Fund for the 
development of the region.
Niger Delta is the south-south geographical area of Federal Republic of 
Nigeria. The region is endorsed with natural resources which constitute 
about 95% of our national income. Consequently to the exploration of 
Oil and Gas, there has been ecological and environmental pollution in 
this region. Rather unfortunate, the region lacks most social 
amenities. These and much more have necessitated the establishment of 
Niger-Delta Development Commission, immediately after the inception of 
this present democratic government in Nigeria.
Sequel to the passing of bill by the National House of Assembly (the 
legislative organ of the Government) and dully accented to by the 
President, legitimising the operations of the Commission by an act of 
law. The commission has, therefore, been constitutionally empowered to 
implement a policy which will relatively address the long standing 
neglect of the region.
Encouragingly, the commission having successfully inherited the fine 
accruing from the violation of the Associated Gas Ejection Act of 1979, 
the oil companies operational in the region have also been mandated to 
pay 2% of their taxable profit to Niger Delta Development Fund, kept in 
NDDC's account in Central Bank of Nigeria - with my commission having 
jurisdiction over the fund. The account has well over hundred million 
dollar.
The commission having performed its duties deligently indentifying, 
negotiating and awarding people-oriented contracts worth millions of 
dollar, myself and colleagues want to have fifteen million US dollar 
(USD15,000,000.00) transferred abroad. 
 
upon your acceptance to collaborate with us, we will front you to have 
performed a contract with the commission, therefore, the beneficiary of 
the fund. Every document in respect of the contract,legitimising you as 
the true beneficiary of the fund authorising its immediate remittance 
into your nominated account shall be obtained and perfected.
You are hereby required to furnish me with the following information:
 1. Bank name and address
 2. Particulars of your bank account
 3. Your private telephone and fax numbers
NOTE, YOU CAN OPEN A VIRGIN ACCOUNT FOR THE FUND
.
On the receipt of the above information, the fund shall be remitted 
into your nominated account within 14 working days.
I must assure you that this transaction is safe in all its totality, 
however, absolute confidentiality is required even after the fund has 
been remitted into your nominated account. Note, for your assistance 
you shall be compensated with 20% of the fund while 5% is for any 
expenses incurred during the transaction.
Though you stand to benefit 20% of the fund for your assistance 
however, our essence of this transaction is purely humanitarian. Myself 
and colleagues have studied the ethnic, political and religious 
situation in the country, we believe, there could be military coup in 
Nigeria, therefore returning Niger-Deltans to black years of military 
rule. 
This is consequently to fact that Hausa dominated Nigerian military and 
their political class are insensitive to the plight of the Niger-
Deltans. It could be recalled during the rule of Hausa, Niger-Delta 
region recorded the highest child mortality in our generation; our 
rivers were polluted by the oil companies and fishing being our primary 
occupation, there was acute starvation across the region.
Myself and colleagues be native of this region, have decided to save 
for the raining days for the benefit of our people. On the demise of 
the present government in Nigeria and Niger-Delta Development 
Commission scrapped, we have pledged to establish  non-governmental 
organisation that is Niger-Deltans oriented to see to the needs of our 
people. It is in this NGO's account the fund shall be repatriated. 
I await your immediate response.
Yours faithfully, 
Dr.Richard Maduka.
