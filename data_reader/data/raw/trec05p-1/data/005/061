Gerald,

Per our earlier discussion, we need to prepare the assignment paperwork to move this contract from ENA to Upstream effective for July 1, 2001.  Please let me know if you need anything else from me in order to begin the process.

Thanks,
Judy Thorne

Debra,

Can you provide some insight as to why this deal has to remain under ENA; and why we will not "undo" this agreement?

Thanks,
Judy Thorne

FYI. It looks like this gas is going to be moved out of our book.  Please let me know if there is anything you need me to do.

  We have executed documents from the customer both a contract and confrim.  They will be fully exeucted by ENA and returned to the customer as such.  Confirmations regarding this contract must be confirmed under this agreement in the name of ENA.  We will not undo this agreement.

Ellen,

If we don't assign the ENA Master, the confirm will need to be a GTC Dedicated Reserves confirmation.

John - Can you provide the Meter Name, number and working interest?

John,

Do we need to send out Revised Master under ENA Upstream Company LLC ?
Otherwise we have to send out a revised Confirmation under GTC.

Please let me know.

Thanks,

The Stevens Oil & Gas deal (06/01/01 - 05/30/02 - Sitara # 892828)) was only entered in the system today. Mary (Terry) Franklin entered it, but under John Grass instructions they entered it under ENA Upstream Company LLC  -  we need to send out revised Confirmation.

The question is, do we need to revise the Master to ENA Upstream too  -  John ?

Regards,
Ellen
