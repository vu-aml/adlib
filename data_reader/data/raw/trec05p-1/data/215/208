Sorry, 
 
Incorrect date on User Test Doc (was Feb 3,4).  Correction is Mon/ Tue 4th and 5th.  No working on Superbowl Sunday!
 
Question for NetCo employees:
The new corp id's xfer to UBS is being considered for this Sunday.  Hence, no start menu access to estate.  You will still have access to NT estate drive data to copy.
Does anyone have the need to retain a estate id for support estate application during the last week?  Exceptions have to be authorized.
Wanted to get a preliminary need analysis.
 
Thanks,

We are planning the next NETCO test, a regression test next week for Netco.  Please review the names attached of who is scheduled to participate, and revise if necessary.
It will be based on EOL deals flowing, and a subset of EnPower/ SItara/ TDS deal entry with the new data (Intercompany, Gas Sale, Power Supply).
 
Monday - global setup, deal entry
Tuesday - downstream, Unify, SAP
 
In addition, please review the attached test schedules.   More detailed information to come, but wanted to get preliminary information back as to participants.
 
Thanks,
