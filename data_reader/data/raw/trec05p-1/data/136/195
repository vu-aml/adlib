Dear Michelle and Richard:
 
The answer is yes, she was an employee of Enron.
 
I will secure her PH file in order to secure her dates of employment.
 
Thanks.
 
Sharon

We need to know the employment status of one additional person.  Can you

let us know whether "Lea Fastow" was an Enron employee and what her dates

of employment are if she was?

Thanks

   Thanks for the information, however I have a question for the 14

   individuals in which we have "No record in SAP".   Do we know for

   certain

   that these individuals where not employed with Enron , or is it that

   there

   is no record of them in SAP HR.  Would a query out of the HR

   datawarehouse

   tell us more information?

   Thanks,

   Kevin
