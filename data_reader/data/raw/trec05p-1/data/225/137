Artie McCoy, VP Financial Surveillance with the NYMEX, 212/299-2928, is awaiting our decision as to whether it is our intention to withdraw from trading on the NYMEX.  Sara, as you may recall, I passed his name on to you about 10 days ago, before UBS surprised us when they walked in and said they were now rethinking wanting the seats again.  So I called Artie back at that time and said the situation was evolving, and once we knew what UBS wanted to do we would let him know.  That's where we left it.
