I've forwarded this to Joe, Rob,a nd MKM as there are some regulatory issues to be considered.  I thought all FERC-regulated electric utilities had to have "OASIS" electronic bulletin boards.  Doesn't PGE have one of those, and if so, can't they post the notice themselves?  Interesting.  DF

Subject: Open Season for expansion of the Kelso-Beaver Pipeline (the "KB Pipeline")


I received a call from Portland General Electric (PGE) asking for assistance in posting an open season for them in regards to their Kelso-Beaver Pipeline.  The reason they are asking for assistance is that they currently do not have an electronic bulletin board.  I have attached a draft version of their open season.  The plan would be to utilize the Hot Tap platform for their posting.
 
Please advise if you have any comments regarding this issue.
 
Thank you.
