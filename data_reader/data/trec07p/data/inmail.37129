If you want more support, you might want to consider rewording this piracy 
theme for one.

Also, even if artists do not make money from producion/copying/distribution, 
that does not leave them with no way to make money. (It may restrict their 
options, but it does not leave them with no options at all.) You don't need 
to overstate the case.

That is one option. Worth an experiment in my book.

Unless htis is for BY and BY-SA works, I am not too interested. To me the 
works are still mostly gonna be useless and pollution.

I have been thinking along similar lines for a few years now, issues down this 
way prevent me from moving as fast as I might like.

If you decide to restrict the game to only Free Works, I may have some ideas 
that could help make the plan better.
