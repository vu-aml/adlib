Attached is the spreadsheet for the Houston Commercial Admins.  Those in white are slated to recieve offers first.  Those in red will only recieve offers if someone on the primary list declines.  Please make sure you and the other desk heads are comfortable with the list as it is.  I will be at the Houstonian today but Amy Fitzpatrick will be here and can assist you if you need to have a meeting to discuss.  Thanks.
