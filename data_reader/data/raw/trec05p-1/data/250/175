Where do we stand on this?  Can we proceed with providing GSP a valuation of ENA's claim?

GSP terminated so ENA did not sign.  I am sending the termination letter to Sara Shackleton.

Cheryl, I thought we terminated the gas swap in the mad scramble before the GSP bankruptcy filing.  Do you have the documentation of who sighed for ENA?

Sara and Cheryl need to discuss this data request.  Please have Cheryl contact Sara so she can understand the exact nature of the request and any deadline issues.

Thanks.

This appears to be an open position since neither party has terminated on the Master Log.

(1)  Any reason why one party cannot terminate?
(2)  Is this a single swap or several?
(3)  I think PWC ought to reveiw our "valuation" (and Bob's curve) since it becomes a matter of public record when the claim is filed in the bankruptcy.  Any valuation ought to be documented.

Carlos Ruiz is asking for the value of the ENA/Garden State Paper (GSP) swap to be included as a creditor in the GSP bankruptcy.  GSP is a bankrupt affiliate and the purpose of the valuation is not to settle but merely to show the claim that ENA has against GSP.  Can I provide him a MTM on the position?  

The internal attorney involved is Cheryl Lindeman.

Thanks
