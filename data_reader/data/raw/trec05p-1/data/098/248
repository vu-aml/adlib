The Nebraska State Bar Association will e-mail frequently to keep you informed. E-mail allows members to receive timely notices and reduces postage and printing costs.  We will be judicious in use of the technology.  At the present time, we will e-mail the NELawExpress, legislative updates and CLE notices.  If you do not wish to receive e-mail from the NSBA, you may notify the NSBA office.  If you are removed from the e-mail system, you will also be removed from print notification of events.
