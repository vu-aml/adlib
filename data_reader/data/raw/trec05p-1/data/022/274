Michelle,  Will you know as soon as the funds have been received?  The EOG
guys in the field are ready to make this happen and the pad is ready for the
building, so please let me know when you get the $. 
	Also, we did tell EOG in the meeting that they would need to have an
Enron inspector to ensure that the station was built to Enron specs.  We
also told them that they would needs some programming time from our
operating team members and Measurement Services in order for the station to
communicate with the SCADA in Houston, etc.   So, there should be some $
somewhere for these things to happen.  The station will also need to be
as-built, etc., and EOG would not know the required information for the
as-builts either.

I just spoke with Mark Kraus from EOG.  He has received the SAP
spreadsheet itemizing the materials and is reviewing the information
with the folks from his field.  When the review is complete, a wire
transfer of funds will be sent to Transwestern.  Because Mark had been
expecting another invoice with the revised amount, he now anticipates
this review to take several days.  Once the funds are received, the
equipment will then be shipped.

Mark mentioned that he thought they were installing all the equipment
themselves and would not need our services.  What additional charges
could there be?
