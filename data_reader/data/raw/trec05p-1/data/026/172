COURT OKS SIX-MONTH LIMIT ON SUITS, REJECTS 10-DAY NOTICE
REQUIREMENT

A provision in an employment contract between a life
insurance company and its agents stating that the agents
would have only six months to bring any claims against the
employer after they left the company was enforceable under
California law, the Ninth Circuit rules, affirming summary
judgment for the employer on the claim ("Soltani v. Western
& Southern Life Ins. Co.,"9th Cir.,  No. 99-56612,  8/6/01).

However, Judge King finds unenforceable a second provision
requiring employees to give Western & Southern Life
Insurance Co. 10 days' written notice before filing a
lawsuit. Finding no valid justification for the provision,
the court strikes it down, finding it unconscionably
deprives employees of a judicial forum.  . . . Page AA-1

ELEVENTH CIRCUIT SPLITS ON VIEW OF FLSA EXEMPTION FOR
COMMISSION PLAN

A painter working for an automobile repair shop may be
entitled to overtime even though he was compensated under a
commission payment plan that is exempt from the requirements
of the Fair Labor Standards Act, a divided Eleventh Circuit
rules ("Klinedinst v. Swift Investments Inc., "11th Cir.,
No. 99-08913-CV-SH, 8/7/01). While agreeing that the
painter's wages constituted commissions, the court remands
the case for a determination of whether his regular rate of
pay was high enough for the FLSA exemption to apply.

Calling the majority's definition of commissions
"expansive," the dissent says there is "considerable doubt"
as to whether Congress intended to shield payment plans such
as the one at issue in this case from the FLSA's
requirements. It argues that the painter was not paid on a
commission basis simply because his compensation was linked
to the amount of time allotted to the job in an automobile
repair estimate. "By any ordinary understanding of the
meaning of commissions," the payments to the painter are not
commissions, the dissenting judge says. The painter "does
not generate sales or jobs for his employer," but rather is
"an ordinary wage-earning employee performing service work
in an automobile garage." . . . Page A-8

 PARTICIPANT HAS STANDING TO CHALLENGE PENSION PLAN
AMENDMENT

A participant in a collectively bargained pension plan has
constitutional standing to sue the plan's administrator
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act for
unilaterally amending the plan to grant the administrator
full discretion in determining benefits eligibility, the
Seventh Circuit rules ("Johnson v. Allsteel Inc., "7th Cir.,
No. 00-1504, 8/7/01).

Reversing a lower court's ruling that Charles Johnson did
not have standing to sue Allsteel Inc. for modifying the
pension plan, the Seventh Circuit finds that Johnson
experienced an "injury-in-fact" even though the plan
administrator had not yet adversely exercised its discretion
against him. The plan amendment adversely impacted Johnson
because it decreased his rights under the plan, the court
said.

 "By adding language that granted itself discretionary
authority to determine eligibility under and to construe the
Plan, Allsteel increased the likelihood that Johnson will,
at some point, be denied benefits under the Plan.  This
correspondingly decreased the certainty of his Plan
entitlements, causing him immediate injury, the court
explains. . . . Page A-2

STEEP ENERGY PRICE DROP PUSHES DOWN PPI

Steeply declining energy prices largely were responsible for
a 0.9 percent drop in producer prices for finished goods in
July, according to figures released by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. It was the largest monthly decline in the
finished goods PPI since August 1993, when the index fell by
1.0 percent.

Finished energy goods prices fell 5.8 percent in July, the
biggest drop since August 1989 when they dropped 7.8
percent. The lack of inflation pressures--apparent in both
the latest PPI data and consumer price figures through
June--takes pressure off the Federal Reserve as its
policymakers approach an Aug. 21 meeting where they must
decide whether to lower interest rates  again. . . . Page

FEMALE TRAINER BARRED FROM MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM CAN GO TO
TRIAL

A female head athletic trainer who was told she could not
work with the George Washington University men's basketball
team because "it was a gender issue" should be allowed to
take her employment discrimination claims to trial, a
District of Columbia trial court rules ("Jenkins v. George
Washington Univ., "D.C. Super. Ct., No. 00 ca 3755, 8/3/01).
Rejecting the university's motion for summary judgment,
Judge Zeldon of the District of Columbia Superior Court
finds that Jacquelin Jenkins has sufficient evidence to make
out a gender discrimination claim under the District of
Columbia Human Rights Act, as well as a constructive
discharge claim. The court finds Jenkins "presented direct
evidence of gender discrimination by citing to the alleged
statements" by the athletic director. It leaves for a jury
to decide, however, whether Jenkins experienced an adverse
action. . . . Page A-2
