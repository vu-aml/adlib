Last night was the game to catch.  Where your seats near where the homer
dropped?

I think the 330 is the better call.  You really don't want a BMW as a family
car anyway until the kids are much older.  I don't know what the prices are
but the 330ic is pretty sweet.

Thanks for the advice.  Much appreciated.  We plan on test driving
this weekend.  The BMW has a racing track in the back of the dealership
-
I heard it's pretty sweet.  I have a feeling we're going to lean toward
the 330i just b/c everything I've read rates it the best in its class.
I feel like the 5 series will be too big for us right now (w/o kids) but
we should get a better feel this weekend.  I'll keep you informed.

Thanks again.

Drive 'em both, but at least for the older one's the 8 cyl was MUCH
smoother.  It really comes down to what you want.   Unless you're really
pushing it you won't notice much of a difference.  However, what you
will
notice is that the 6cyl will be working a lot harder (i.e. louder).
Once
you jump into the 5 you're in the luxury market and you probably want a
smoother car with plenty of torque (8 cyl).  Especially the way you
drive
(not winding the engine out in every gear) you'll feel more low end
power in
the 540.  Again, it comes down to the pax.  If you're hauling 2 most of
the
time, the 530 is probably fine;. hauling 4 it will be sucking wind a
bit.
Remember when you're on a test drive the car isn't configured the way it
will be in real life.  The tires will be under inflated, the gas tank
(large
in that car, like 14 gal ~90 pounds) and no passengers so your
performance
will seem better.  My best advice when looking at cars in that price
range
is to insist on an extended (overnight or over a weekend) test drive of
both.  You don't want to buy and wish you had bought the other a couple
of
weeks later.  Finally, think about long term (kids, etc) if you plan on
hanging onto it as long as the Miata.  It's not uncommon for a bimmer to
go
2-300,000 miles without engine work so you can hang onto them for quite
a
while if you stay up on the maintenance.  Give me a buzz at home
(301.737.5366) tonight if you want to yap about it.

What do you think about the 530?  Isn't it basically the same thing
as the 330 except it's bigger?  If so, does it handle as well with the
added size and weight?

Kev,

Real quick on the cars.  The beamer is real tight in the back seat.
Think
about how often you might be hauling 3-4 people.  If you think it's a
factor, spend some time on an extended test drive sitting in the back.
I'd
still look at the Vovlvo S-60 twin turbo, it might surprise you.

I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section
154.
It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the
astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and
2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of
work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem
is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand
into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really
big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning
toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's
a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and
should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying
time???

That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend.  I don't expect him
to call
of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he
was 
working for 8 mos. in Dallas.

Later,

kevin

Some idiot lost a pair of pliers so I have to wait around to go fly.  I
guess it's just as well, I'd hate to find them at 3,000'.

Sorry to hear about the turbo Miata.  What happened to it?  Can't it be
fixed or are you just abandoning it?  Where are you leaning in terms of
a
new car?  On my end, the classic motorcycle is buzzing like  a champ and
a
complete blast to drive.

What's with the faggot Astro's walking your boy?  At least he pocketed
one
record.

I don't have TJ's email w/ me, but I'm sure he never expected you to
actually show up in the first place.

Conway,

Do you have T.J.'s new email address.  I want to let him know I
won't be out there in Oct.  Give me a shout.  How's everything going?

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be
that soon.  It looks like I'm forced to buy a new car.  I'm not 
looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

Talk to you soon.  

KR
