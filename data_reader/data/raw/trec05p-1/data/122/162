     The Bentley Arnage Red Label is a beautiful four sedan, but it's not for everyone.
http://www.bentleymotors.co.uk/bentley/picture_gallery/bentley_2.jpg
True though it may be that when ordering the Arnage one gets to specify burr walnut, burr oak, bird's eye maple or black lacquer veneer, most would still find the $200K+ sticker price out of reach. Even most of those in a position to do the deal would walk away in the face of a dubious value proposition. After all, burr oak veneer is still veneer.


WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH LEGAL RESEARCH?

     Lawyers from coast-to-coast complain that computer based legal research costs continue to spin out of control. Many, given their firm size, practice area or jurisdiction, simply can no longer justify these onerous annual contracts with West or Lexis. Others have concluded, as one guesses they might with the Bentley, that after peeling back the veneer, these highfalutin compusearchers simply cost more than they are worth. 


THEORY vs. REALITY

     As nice as it might be to own a Bentley, it would have been nicer still had they simply provided you with a shiny new Arnage for free while you were in law school, just as our competitors regularly hook law students with free unlimited access, only to yank the needle upon graduation.

     What percentage of attorneys in the real world enjoy unlimited access to WestLaw? Perhaps more to the point, what percentage enjoy unlimited access to those WestLaw resources that their practice truly demands? Are you one of the select few who wants for little or nothing, or are you in a pick-and-choose mode with the overwhelming majority of your colleagues? 

     --What do you do when you have to research across state lines?

     --What do you do with a Federal question that properly demands a national look across all thirteen Federal circuits?

     --How do you respond to a legal research industry that likes to market primary jurisdiction packages and thumbs its nose at the reality that you practice in a state like Vermont, for example, a jurisdiction that only issues about 100 new published opinions ANNUALLY, and not surprisingly has yet to consider anything remotely resembling your client's situation?

     Our subscribers snicker to themselves, click a checkbox to search ALL states and they pay not one thin additional dime for the privilege. (See covered jurisdictions listed below the signature line.)


"I AM IN MY SWEATS DOING BILLABLE RESEARCH. I LOVE IT!"

     And there you have our new favorite quote, from a new subscriber leaving a large firm to start her own thing. We have others; lots of them. See, http://www.thelaw.net/references.htm

     What's not to like?

--TheLaw.net is less than $1 a day for an individual annual subscription. Even less per day, per workgroup user. See, http://www.thelaw.net/susbcribe.htm

--Enter a statutory cite into the search engine, and pop up cases construing that item, in one mouse click. See, http://www.thelaw.net/statutes.htm

--Have a case citation you need to know more about? Find cases construing that item in one mouse click. Simple.

--Easy to use? Do you know how to operate a browser, shuttle through little windows folders and do electronic case law research? If so, you're on your way to being a guru using TheLaw.net. If you don't know how to perform these tasks, we will teach at no cost.

--PERFORM UNKNOWN ITEM SEARCHES: Use Boolean and, or, not, near, within, adjacent, nesting, truncation See, Sample Searches: http://www.thelaw.net/searchdemo/home.htm
     
--PERFORM KNOWN ITEM SEARCHES: Field search by cite, party, counsel, docket, author, date or panel.  See, http://www.thelaw.net/help/operators.htm


WHAT ABOUT WEST AND LEXIS?

     Pay them only when you have to. Will you still use Lexis or West from time to time? Sure. Probably. But perhaps you will get to the point where you use them on the web with your credit card, when you can't otherwise get the answer faster, cheaper elsewhere. Or maybe you like that West or Lexis Primary Jurisdiction Plan that you've been using all these years and you think TheLaw.net can provide a sort of meter insurance for those occasions where the circumstances call for a national look.
