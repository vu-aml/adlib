Dear ,

We are Stanley and Linda the children of Late General 
Malick Taboh the former Director of military inteligence 
and special acting General Manager of the Sieria Leone 
Diamond mining coperation( SLDMC ). We are contacting you 
to seek your good assistance to transfer and invest USD 
8.5 million belonging to our late father which is 
deposited in a bank here in Abidjan.

This money is revenues from solid minirals and dimonds 
sales which were under my fathers possession before the 
civil war broke out. Following the break out of the war, 
almost all government offices,coperations and parastatals 
were attacked and vandalized.

The SLDMC was loothed and burnt down to ashes,and diamonds 
worth millions of dollars was stolen by the rebel military 
forces who attacked our fathers office, many top 
government officials and senior army officers were 
assasinated and our father was a key target because of his 
very sensitive military possition and appointment in the 
SLDMC.Regreatably, our father was captured and murdered 
along with his brother in cool blood during a mid-night 
rebel shoot-out when our official residence in freetown 
was armbushed by Fordey Sanko the notorious rebel leader. 
Our mother sustainded very sever bullet injuries which 
resulted to her untimely and painful death in a private 
hospital here in Ivory Coast.

Now we are alone in a totally strange country without 
parents, relatives or any body to care for us at our 
tender ages. Before our mother died, she told us that our 
father deposited some money which he made from diamond 
sales and contracts in a bank here in Ivory Coast and that 
we should pray and find a trust worthy foreign business 
partner who would help us to transfer and invest this 
money in profitable business venture overseas.

She told us to do this quickly so that we can leave Ivory 
Coast and then settle down abroad. She gave us the bank 
document to prove the deposit and then told us that our 
father used my name as the only son to deposit the money 
in the bank.She told us that this is the reason why we 
came to Ivory Coast. My mother died after wards. May her 
spirit rest in perfect peace.

I have gone to the bank to make inquires about this money 
and I spoke with the Manager of International remittance 
who assured me that everything is intact and promised to 
help us transfer this money to my fathers foreign partners 
bank account as soon as we provide our fathers partners 
foreign bank account for them. However, the manager is 
very concerned because of our age. I am 23 years why my 
younger sister is 19 years and as such advised that we 
should look for a matured person that will represent me at 
the bank.

If you are willing to assist us, please let us know 
immediately so that you will arrange the transfer of the 
money to your account with the bank.Please note that we 
will offer you 10% of the total money as compensation for 
your noble assistance in accodiance
with my mothers advise. I am interested in any profitable 
commercial venture which you consider very good in your 
country and you would also get a school for me, my little 
sister so that we can finish our college education.

Please there is urgent need for the money to be 
transferred to your account because of the political 
crises they are having in Cote d'Ivoire now. We are hoping 
to hear your urgent response so that we can not look for 
another foreign partner.

Please reply to this email 
address(stanleytaboh3@katamail.com)

Thank you and may God bless you and your dear family.

Yours sincerely
Stanley and linda Taboh.
