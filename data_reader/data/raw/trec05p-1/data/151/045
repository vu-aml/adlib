Investment ideas 
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
Stimulus is the key going forward
Investors themselves, and not any single outside force, may 
generate a further market rally.

By Charles Payne, founder, CEO, and principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

With Thanksgiving smack dab in the middle of the week, it was hard determining 
what the market wanted to do or where investors' heads were at. After all, the 
market seemed to be running on empty until the holiday-shortened Friday 
session, when the market zoomed. Of course, sticking with the engine analogy, 
nay-sayers will say that the market was just rolling downhill, benefiting from an 
abbreviated session that saw lighter-than-normal volume. I would agree that 
Fridays session wasnt an apples-to-apples comparison with regular sessions--it 
was more like running a soapbox derby racer versus an open-wheel Indy-type 
car that the market typically runs during a full session. According to those folks 
that dont believe in the current market rally, Fridays results were amusing and 
even entertaining, but of no enduring value.

It would be easy to write the session off as a day-race that held little value in the 
grand scheme of things, but that would be a big mistake. In the soapbox derby, 
gravity draws the homemade racers down a modest hill. The same could have 
happened to stocks on Friday. Instead stocks climbed up that same modest hill. 
Stocks defied both gravity and the naysayers by trading higher and higher as the 
day went on. There is a message in that achievement: I think it tells us that when 
left to its own devices, the market wants to rally higher. Sure, when there are 
earnings reports, economic data, brokerage downgrades, wars, unemployment, 
fear, and warnings from corporate America, the race becomes akin to handling a 
high-performance race car and turning corners at 180 miles an hour. It isnt as 
easy as it looks.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Models of success?
Surviving Internet players have better business models, but share 
prices may still be too high for some.

By Dave Sterman

In a few weeks, 2001 will come to a close, putting the wraps on a forgettable year 
for the Internet sector. Many firms have already headed for bankruptcy, and other 
weaker players are also expected to shutter operations later in the winter. 

But investors are clearly focusing on the eventual winners in the Internet space, 
as share prices for healthier companies have been soaring in recent weeks. This 
week, we went looking for net stocks that are still growing and appear firmly in 
the "survivor" category.  

We specifically looked for Web-oriented companies that are boosting sales at a 
heady clip. As the accompanying table shows, these stocks have also seen their 
shares rise sharply, leading to the question: are they still a bargain?
