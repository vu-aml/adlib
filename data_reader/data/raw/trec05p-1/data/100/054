Player Updates NFL Reports  	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News 

Terrell Davis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/24/01 
Five weeks removed from arthroscopic knee surgery, the Denver Broncos running back was taken by surprise Wednesday when told of news reports saying he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the season. "At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday," Davis said. Davis admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks. He remained on the scout team Wednesday. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report. 

Amani Toomer  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 10/24/01 
According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/24/01 
Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL. 

Chris Sanders  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear. 

Bert Emanuel  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1186&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up. 

Hines Ward  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 10/24/01 
Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee. 

Germane Crowell  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12306&>, WR DET - Giggles Updated 10/24/01 
The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season. 

Santana Moss  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
The New York Daily News says there is still a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2. 

Brett Favre  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 10/24/01 
Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight. 

Marvin Minnis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still working with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which player will start on Thursday against the Colts. 

Larry Foster  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks. 

Marcus Robinson  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1676&>, WR CHI - Hunter Updated 10/24/01 
The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league. 

Neil Rackers  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=187627&>, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play. 

Todd Pinkston  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Hunter Updated 10/24/01 
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis. 

Ron Dixon  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week. 

Joe Jurevicius  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12484&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines. 

Reggie Swinton  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. "He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be available," said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence. 

Joey Galloway  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Giggles Updated 10/24/01 
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. "We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days," said head coach Dave Campo. 

Darrin Chiaverini  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=133247&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury. 

Raghib Ismail  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game. 

Ricky Watters  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again." If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch. 

Trent Dilfer  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point. 

Matt Hasselbeck  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams. 

Dedric Ward  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season. 

Lamar Smith  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week. 

Marvin Minnis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week. 

Jerome Pathon  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12612&>, WR IND - Tori Updated 10/23/01 
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week. 

Terrence Wilkins  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week. 

Terrell Davis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.

Giggles Player News 

Germane Crowell  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12306&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/24/01 
The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.

Joey Galloway  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1286&>, Active WR Updated 10/24/01 
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. "We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days," said head coach Dave Campo. 

Duce Staley  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1757&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/23/01 
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Trung Canidate  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=187503&>, Active RB Updated 10/23/01 
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. "I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game," coach Mike Martz said. "He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play." Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

Keyshawn Johnson  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1265&>, Active WR Updated 10/22/01 
Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice this week and could miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.

Jerome Bettis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1152&>, Active RB Updated 10/21/01 
Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against any defense.

Peter Warrick  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=187401&>, Active WR Updated 10/21/01 
Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not find the end zone often. 

Daunte Culpepper  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=133263&>, Active QB Updated 10/19/01 
Green Bay's defense has played well so far, but Culpepper won't be intimidated by the Packers. He has faced them many times before, and should fare well in an important divisional game in front of the home crowd.

Tyrone Wheatley  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1140&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/18/01 
The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.

Rob Johnson  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1033&>, Reserve QB Updated 10/16/01 
Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't use Johnson.

Raiders  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=21&>, Active DT Updated 10/02/01 
The Raiders have lost DE Trace Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore his Achilles' tendon in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery this week and be placed on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In other news, DT Roderick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys after sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is questionable for Sunday after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder. 

Deuce McAllister  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=235228&>, Reserve RB Updated 09/02/01 
McAllister rushed for 108 yards on 19 carries, all in the first half, had a 36-yard punt return in the second half, and caught four passes for 20 yards during Saturday's preseason finale. "That was probably the best he's run the whole year," Saints Head Coach Jim Haslett said. "I don't think he's where he should be yet, but we're just starting to see what he can do." While McAllister won't be the Saints' starting running back likely at all this season, he might be a good insurance policy for Ricky Williams owners in Fantasy leagues.

Mike Hollis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1387&>, Active K Updated 07/27/01 
Despite being angry with Jacksonville management, Hollis reported to training camp on time. Hollis, who is having a contractual dispute with the team, boycotted June workouts and doesn't expect to be with the team next year. In any event, Hollis is still a solid kicker and will be one of the first ten placekickers taken in most Fantasy drafts.
