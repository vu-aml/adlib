Lloyd, got this error message.  Is Kevin still around, if so could you forward it to him.  Hope you had a good new years and that 2002 is rewarding.  Must say i was pretty happy with the FERC order, it should still be meaningful for Enron if and when the trading operations are sold (i hear that a new owner may be revealed 1/10 and hope that that party is able to reharness the talent!!!). 

regards 

Mike

Finally have a couple of minutes to send a quick email.  I am sure that you

heard the FERC news on 12/19 about MidWest development.  Successful

conclusion to 8 months work for me and more for others...under different

circumstances it would have been the cause for celebrations in Houston

(seemed like the biggest win for Enron GA in 2001 to me but then i am

biased)!  I am happy that we got that win even if it was clouded by the

bigger issues facing the firm.  Looks like the MidWest will get one RTO and

congestion mgmt protocol....

While the news wasn't celebrated around here for obvious reasons, i also

believe that this outcome will be better for AEP in the long run.  I am

hopeful that the executives here see it the same way in time and look

forward to 2002.  Hope that things work out well for all of you, i enjoyed

the experience even if it was cut short.  Keep in touch.

regards
