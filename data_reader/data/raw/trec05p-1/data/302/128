The invoice for $3,151,4550.05 is on SAP 3000012785

I found a payment from Duke Energy Field Services to settle storage fees due post bankruptcy dated 3/229/02.  These funds are on SAP 3000006586 in the amount of $2,735,550.05 - short from the invoice of $416,000.00

I have screen prints on each and will bring them to you and turn over to the appropriate party.

Thanks

Larry

Priscilla was asking me if we ever paid for the Centanna storage that we sold to Duke Energy Field Services, LP.

I see that deal 1203368 was entered in Sitara on April 1, 2002 by Joe Parks.  The deal is a sale of 1,006,885 dth to Duke Energy Field Services at $3.13 on 3/30/02.  This is showing up in A/R as an outstanding receivable and Priscilla is wondering if the cash may be sitting in another account or different Duke entity.

Any ideas?
