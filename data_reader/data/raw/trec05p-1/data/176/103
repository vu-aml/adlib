Crude Oil Futures Rise Ahead of Extended Holiday Weekend

    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.34 
to $19.62 per barrel on Friday as the market traded on short-term 
technicals. Traders were squaring their books before the long 
Christmas hokiday. Expectations that OPEC would finally move ahead 
with a plan to remove 2 million bpd from the world market likely gave 
the pre-holiday market a boost. The cartel has agreed to chop 1.5 
million bpd from production if non-OPEC producers remove an 
additional 500,000 bpd between them. Last week, Omans raised its 
pledge to trim output from 25,000 to 40,000 bpd, which leaves the 
cartel only 37,500 bpd short of its goal. OPEC ministers plan to meet 
in Cairo on December 28th to weigh their options, but insiders say 
the cartel will move ahead with their plans, despite the relatively 
small shortfall. Petroleum inventories are 50 million barrels higher 
than a year ago, after a slumping economy whittled away at demand. 
But gasoline and heating oil stockpiles unexpectedly fell for the 
week ended December 14th and crude inventories rose less than 
predicted. The EIA said that the national average retail price for 
gasoline has fallen $0.036 to $1.06 per gallon, down $0.36 from a 
year ago. Gasoline futures for January delivery on the NYMEX climbed 
$0.0083 to $0.5586 per gallon. January heating oil futures on the 
NYMEX rose $0.0035 to $0.5484 per gallon after forecasts that 
temperatures in the Northeast would be near or below normal over the 
Christmas season. In London, Brent crude oil futures for February 
delivery on the IPE were up $0.23 to $19.36 per barrel.

Bad Weather in Russia Lowers Oil Exports

 
    Russia is set to announce crude exports in the 4th quarter were 
almost 150,000 bpd below what was planned due to bad weather. The 
fall, equal to what OPEC asked Russia to cut in exports in the 1st 
quarter of 2002, would be down from an initial 4th quarter schedule 
of 2.88 million bpd for Russian and transit oil. The 4th quarter 
figures will be released in early January. Predictions are that 
Russia will be short by 145,000  160,000 bpd if the weather does not 
take a turn for the worse. Third quarter exports came in around 3 
million bpd. Russia committed to trim exports by 150,000 bpd as part 
of OPEC's plan to have non-members contribute 500,000 bpd in export 
reductions before the cartel would lower its production by 1.5 
million bpd. Removal of the oil from the global market is aimed at 
lifting prices which have tumbled as an economic downturn has eaten 
away at demand. But, Russian oil exports were already hard hit by 
inclement weather in November when the key ports of Novorossiisk and 
Tuapse in Russia, Odessa in Ukraine and Ventspils in Latvia were 
closed for a total of 25 days. In December, Novorossiisk was shut-
down for over 10 days, while Lithuanian terminal Butinge was closed 
the entire month because of an oil leak. Russian crude output and 
export schedules are established every quarter and spread among the 
country's oil firms. OPEC has asked Russia to explain the statistics 
of its promised 1st quarter cut before the cartel meets on December 
28 in Cairo to set its own final reduction. Those close to the 
situation have reported that Russia will set exports at 2.6 million 
bpd, or about 144,000 bpd lower than the 4th quarter. Lukoil said 
that Russia needed to reduce output to prevent an already overloaded 
pipeline system from breaking down.

Saudi Arabia and Oil Majors Negotiating Natural Gas Agreements

    Saudi Arabia and 8 international oil companies, which are 
negotiating large natural gas investments in the country, have said 
that they expect to sign executive agreements by next March. The 
agreements center around 3 multi-billion dollar projects in the Saudi 
natural gas sector. ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell will take the 
lead in the kingdom's natural gas initiative. ExxonMobil has the lead 
role in the $15 billion South Ghawar development, core venture one, 
which includes Royal Dutch/Shell, BP and Phillips. ExxonMovil will 
also lead the $5 billion Red Sea development, core venture 2, which 
includes Occidental and Marathon. Royal Dutch/Shell has the leading 
role in the $5 billion Shaybah development, core venture three, with 
Conoco and TotalFinaElf. The natural gas initiative is expected to 
boost the Saudi economy and create jobs. The kingdom's natural gas 
upstream has been off-limits to foreign companies for the past 25 
years.

EIA 2002 Energy Outlook 

    Average world oil prices will gradually move higher from 2002 
through the year 2020 as demand rises by 56%, according to the EIA in 
its Annual Energy Outlook 2002 report, but natural gas and 
electricity prices will likely fall. The EIA expects world oil demand 
to rise to 118.9 million bpd in 2020. World demand stood at 76 
million bpd seen in 2000. World oil prices will also average $22.48 a 
barrel in 2001, down from $27.72 in 2000, before starting a gradual 
increase after 2002, the report predicted. The price in 2020 will 
reach $24.68 per barrel, largely due to higher projected world 
demand. The EIA also forecasted that OPEC oil production will reach 
57.5 million bpd in 2020, almost twice the 30.9 million bpd produced 
last year. Average wellhead prices for natural gas will likely be at 
$4 per Mcf in 2001, up from $3.60 in 2000, but then decline sharply 
by 2020, the EIA report said. It predicted a price of $3.26 per Mcf 
for 2020, even though demand that year will likely be 1 Tcf lower 
than was projected in 2001, because of a less optimistic assessment 
of natural gas reserves discovered by exploratory drilling. 
Electricity prices are also predicted to decline to $0.065 per kWh in 
2020, down from $0.069 in 2000. But the new 2020 price level is 
higher than the $0.061 projected last year because of higher than 
previously expected electricity demand. The accuracy of 20-year 
forecast is not only severely limited but also does not account for 
the volatility during the period. To see the full report, please go

Antitrust Lawsuit Reinstated Against Major Oil Companies
  
    An appeals court has strengthened the claims of a 1997 lawsuit 
that alleges oil and petrochemical companies used shared salary 
information to unlawfully keep workers' pay at artificially low 
levels. The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals tossed out a lower court 
ruling dismissing the lawsuit, brought against 14 major companies 
that employ about 80% - 90% percent of the industry's work force. The 
defendants previously denied the allegations. The case was sent back 
to the lower court for further proceedings. The lawsuit was brought 
by a former Exxon worker on behalf of herself and other Exxon 
employees alleging the companies violated federal antitrust law by 
regularly sharing detailed information about compensation paid to 
nonunion managerial, professional and technical employees agreeing 
that they would use the data to set salaries. In addition to Exxon, 
the other defendants include: Mobil, Texaco and Chevron.
