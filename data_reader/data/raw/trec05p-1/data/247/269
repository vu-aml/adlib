Neartown neighbors,

1....The community e-mail response to Reliant- HL&P's (R-H) press release on the installation of the big poles has been significant. More so than anything else to date.  

A busy afternoon and evening kept me from seeing Channel 11's Saturday afternoon news item filmed earlier that day on Peden. Did you see it? Did anybody? Was it even aired at all?

I will continue to follow-up w/ R-H on one aspect that C.11 found very nteresting. Described best by an excerpt from my written response to R-H's no-community-meeting decision...."Of the various items we discussed on the phone that could position R-H in a better light, two merit your consideration. To reduce or deflect the visual intrusion of the large metal battleship gray poles, I suggested that the civic associations involved be allowed to paint, decorate or disguise the poles. 

The civic associations, working with guidelines established by your company, would determine through a publicized competition, which designs the community wants to see or live with on their streets.

The other idea is the installation of wood poles along the freeway side of the Dunlavy park baseball field. The Neartown Little League would then hang netting on the poles to prevent foul balls from falling into freeway traffic."


2....Last week I reported something that turns out to be an error. The metal poles and lines along Dunlavy as they cross the freeway bridge going south, do NOT go underground at North or South Blvds or under any street in that area. A few of you let me knows about that, and I finally went to see for myself. The power lines and poles turn west along the freeway after the bridge. Should have checked that sooner before beating the R-H guy silly with that "fact." 

3...This is the week to submit Capital Improvement Plans (CIP) for District D at either a Tuesday or Thursday evening meeting. 

Neartown-Montrose Super Neighborhood Council ....will submit five super neighborhood action plans that include the reconstruction of three major east-west traffic corridors and plans for two area parks. 

Neartown Association will submit two requests...A. asking the mayor to declare all of Montrose a neighborhood to Standards area so that all streets can be placed in the Street Overlay Program and to address widespread storm drainage problems.
B....Requesting that 4-way stop signs be placed around all parks and public, private and parochial schools. Not exactly a CIP item, but we are taking advantage of the moment to present this anyway. 

Cherryhurst Park, North Cherryhurst, Vermont Commons, First Montrose Commons and East Montrose are submitting CIP proposals.It's not to late for you as an individual, block face, street, neighborhood or community association to participate in submitting a proposal for the COH to place on next year's budget to turn that proposal into a project. Call me and I'll fax you a CIP form and/or discuss what you have in mind.

4.....Neartown Little league's first game is in a few weeks and there's still time for your kids to participate. Call me or NLL president, Will Weber at 713-527-8685.

Thanks
