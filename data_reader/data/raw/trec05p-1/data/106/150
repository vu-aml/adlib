Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI 

I am stuck on my last starter. Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the season. 

Answer - GG 

Alexander has been a revelation in his first two starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems. 


Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA 

Should I start Rod Gardner or Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is looking better each week. 

Answer - GG 

Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants' No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week. Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with Hilliard because of his experience and continuing improvement. 


Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO 

I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB - Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson? 

Answer - GG 

Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.

Tip of the Week 

Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle. And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.
