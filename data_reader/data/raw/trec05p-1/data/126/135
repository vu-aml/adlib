I agree with her to some extent from an IT standpoint  -- we are having trouble getting Anthony to focus on some of the smaller issues when he is so focused on the Power and Genesys sytems, but he has been accommodating today

Need to update you on our offsite yesterday  -- and some good "ah -ha's " that Anthony finally had.  He is a hard IT person to work with (similar to Beth ) in that they think they know exactly what you do and what you need, and it is very hard to convince them of anything else.  We made some good progress yesterday.

Will update you on this RAC situation at our meeting this afternoon

RAC does not have all the facts here (not surprising) although we produce a pathetic little report around this which probably does not explain all of the facts

A 5000 backlog can crop up in a matter of 1 week

I will call Bill Bradford as soon as I have assembled all of the facts

SInce your name was not on the original list, I am forwarding this to you.  

Molly's comment that "many lack the clear understanding ..." in the third paragraph below - to whom does this apply and do you agree with her?  --Sally

Bill

This problem is stemming from the volume in Mass Market as you know.  As a result, significantly more new transactions are being booked to "New Counterpart"  than can be cleaned up from historical deals.  As Credit has been emphasizing for some months now, this is not acceptable for this business, is not maintainable (proof in the attached report) and IT resources are required to automate current manual processes.

Global Counterparty is testing their new process to automate the set up of new counterparts in GCP such that the GCP ID may also be returned to EES in conjunction with our credit response prior to booking (expected delivery next Monday0.   However, the risk system batch process specifically for RPS must be enhanced to automatically create the counterpart and accept the GCP ID.  Efforts are finally underway to this end and are expected to be tested within the week.  Then, downstream processing through to billing may benefit.

Many lack the clear understanding that it has taken not only GCP to set up the counterpart in Global Counterpart but also Deal Capture to establish and map the counterpart in RPS and RGS (both have been manual procesess, the latter severly under resourced).  

Once this is implemented, EES has over 20,000 Mass Market transactions executed now, so efforts need to continue to clean up this backlog.  More importantly, three companies have already filed bankruptcy.  We must complete these efforts to manage the portfolio and respond to these events.

Molly

This is totally unacceptable.  Is there any focus on cleaning this up?
