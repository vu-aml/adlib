Latest NFL Player News

Shannon Sharpe <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1329&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Sharpe (leg) practiced on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week. 

Drew Brees <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=235197&>, QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
There still seems to be a chance Brees might play this week or before the season ends, says the San Diego Union-Tribune . He has been taking snaps with the first team in practice. "I'm not going to say that he will play, (but) could he play? Yes," Mike Riley. "But I'm not going to say he will for sure. 

Kevan Barlow <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 12/20/01
Despite scoring on two short TD runs last week, Barlow is not offically the Niners' goal-line back, says the Contra-Costa Times. "It's a coincidence," Barlow said. "It was my turn in the rotation to be in there." The two backs will continue to split carries. 

Terrell Owens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 12/20/01

Ike Hilliard <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Russell Updated 12/20/01
The New York Daily News says the pain in Hilliard's toe has worsened. He aggravated the injury in Week 14, but he is expected to play against Seattle. 

Santana Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Moss (quadriceps) has returned to practice. He might be able to play this week.

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
McNair has missed some practice time this week because of a back injury. He is still expected to start. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Bouman (thumb) missed practice on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week, although the Minneapolis Star-Tribune says he might have to throw in pain. "We think he'll be practicing full speed on Thursday and Friday," Dennis Green said. "I think he'll get accustomed to how he's got to throw the ball and I think he will be effective."

Terrence Wilkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Wilkins will sit out again this week with a hamstring injury. Reggie Wayne will be the No. 2 receiver against the Jets. 

James McKnight <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
McKnight is listed as probable for this week's game with a back injury. He is expected to play against New England. 

Larry Foster <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Foster (thigh) might not be able to play this week. Bert Emanuel may take his place as Detroit's No. 2 receiver. 

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 12/20/01

Bert Emanuel <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1186&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Emanuel returned to practice on Wednesday. If his knee shows no sign of swelling, he should play this week, says the Detroit Free Press. 

Aaron Shea <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=187642&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Shea did not participate in team drills on Wednesday. He is not expected to play this week, and O.J. Santiago will start in his place. 

Scott Mitchell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1025&> , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Mitchell strained his right rib cage on Wednesday. He is doubtful for Sunday's game, and now Kevin Thompson will back up Jon Kitna, who is expected to start although he still has a finger injury. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Walls (ankle) particpated in some drills on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable, and Kris Mangum will start in Walls' place if he cannot play. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/20/01

Allen is ready to assume a larger workload, says the Baltimore Sun. He may start against the Bengals this week. "I expect to see more time but I'm still not 100 percent," Allen said. "My hand is going to bother me but I need to be out there on the field to help this team."

Elvis Grbac <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Don't expect to see Grbac benched this year, or anytime soon, Brian Billick told the Baltimore Sun. "He's my quarterback now, he's going to be my quarterback next year, hopefully the year after that and the year after that," Billick said. "The only thing that would change that is if he chooses to retire or God forbid, he'd get a career-ending injury." 

Chris Chandler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Chandler won't have too look over his shoulder this week. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution says Michael Vick will not see action unless Chandler is injured. 

MarTay Jenkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=133322&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 12/20/01
Jenkins (ankle) did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. 

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Watters has placed on injured reserve. He will not play again this season. Shaun Alexander will be the starter for Seattle's final three games. 

Brian Griese <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Matty Updated 12/19/01
Griese should be able to return from a concussion after the bye week. Jarious Jackson will be Denver's No. 2 QB. 

Joe Jurevicius <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=12484&>, WR NYG - Giggles Updated 12/19/01
Jurevicius (hamstring) is expected to return to action on Sunday. He may be able to catch a deep ball or two against the erratic Seattle secondary. 

Travis Henry <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=235216&>, RB BUF - Martin Updated 12/19/01
Henry will miss Sunday's game with a sprained right knee. Shawn Bryson will start in his place.

Dwight (fluid in lung) is not expected to play this week. He has not produced very much this year when healthy.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 12/19/01
Wheatley, who was not used last week, is expected to see some playing time in Week 15. He will probably not be used enough, however, to help most Fantasy teams. 

Derrick Mason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1816&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
