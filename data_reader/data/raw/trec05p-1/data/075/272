I agree.  I think we should go for it.  However, expect Brulte and Cox to push us for another 75K.  Apparently that is what Reliant gave to the R's.  This is probably the trip to Houston we were expecting back in August.

It seems that since we've already contributed, we're invited.  Given where Davis' numbers have gone recently, Riordan's imminent announcement and potential, and the fact that the Rs have played it about as well as could be expected under the circumstances (save for Morrow, who we may want to bring up with Brulte if the lunch is attended, this could be a useful gathering.  And it doesn't require crossing the border into California, to boot.

Best,
Jeff

Enron gave $50k to the Rep party at Brulte and Cox's request.  If Enron
is participating, please let us know.  Also, this is a reminder that
Scott will be back in early Nov. and I will return Nov. 12th.  Behave
yourselves.  Fondly,  Hedy
