Scouting Report Special Edition---Where technology hits home.

Every year, the worlds most innovative electronics companies meet in Las Vegas to unveil their newest creations. The Consumer Electronics Show features thousands of new products and is attended by every major retailer in the world. Unfortunately, most of these retailers are limited by a lack of shelf space and convoluted distribution systems. By the time the newest technology makes it to their stores, it is not so new. That is not the case at TechnoScout.com, where you can find the latest, greatest, neatest and coolest products, often before they are available in stores. Here is one of our favorite products from this years show.

Your radio just got 5,000 new stations 

The iRhythm Wireless Remote Tuner makes it easy to listen to the best programs in the world in high fidelity without hard-wired connections.

If you believe you have been missing something great from your PC and Internet connection, you may be right. It is radio from stations throughout North America and around the world in high fidelity. If you know about Net radio, you realize that hundreds of radio stations from everywhere in the world are broadcast over the Internet. The trouble is, you have to surf the Web to find them (that can take hours). Then you have to listen to them in front of your PC over small speakers. The iRhythm Wireless Internet Remote Tuner from Sonicbox solves both of these problems effortlessly. The system gives you the software and components to turn your stereo into a high fidelity receiver of Best of Planet TM Internet radio stations. Even more, you do not need a high-speed Internet connection, and there is no wiring necessary between your PC and stereo. Once you set up the iRhythm Remote Tuner you can dial up any station on the Internet without touching your computer as long as it is turn! ed on. A handheld RF remote control lets you switch stations from anywhere in your house up to 100 feet away from your computer (through walls and floors), using the same kind of 900 MHz frequency used on cordless telephones.
