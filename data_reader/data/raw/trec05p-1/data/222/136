With the Enron debacle dominating not just the business page, but the front page, it seems like a good opportunity to look at two recent books that speak to the problems of corporate accountability (or lack thereof), Corporate Irresponsibility <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300090234/ref=mk_del_256931_39> and The Divine Right of Capital <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1576751252/ref=mk_del_256931_40>. Also, Joseph Badaracco's Leading Quietly <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1578514878/ref=mk_del_256931_41> gets on my shortlist of candidates for best business book of the year. This is a leadership book that takes its cue not from the boardrooms of corporate America, but from the more mundane situations and decisions that most of us face in business every day. Also featured in this mailing is a list of the top 10 business books of 2001 as selected by the editors of Harvard Business Review <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005U5EB/ref=mk_del_256931_42>.

by Joseph L. Badaracco 
Most books on business leadership tend to focus on the high-profile Fortune 500 types--the Jack Welches, the Bill Gateses, and the Michael Dells. According to Joseph Badaracco, however, this view of leadership is incredibly narrow because it ignores the fact that "the vast majority of problems calling for leadership are everyday situations" faced by managers up and down the corporate hierarchy. In Leading Quietly <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1578514878/ref=mk_del_256931_45> Badaracco uses real-life examples to illustrate eight guidelines of what quiet leadership means.

Bill Jensen turns the tables on corporate management and asks, "Why should we work for you?" For Jensen, the answer goes way beyond compensation and benefits. In Work 2.0 <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738205699/ref=mk_del_256931_50>, he lays out a new contract based on the realization that in this networked and knowledge-based economy, employees are a company's number-one asset and its most important investor.

by Jagdish Sheth, Rajendra Sisodia 
McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's; Bank of America, Chase Manhattan, and Bank One; American, United, and Delta. What do these companies have in common? In The Rule of Three <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/074320560X/ref=mk_del_256931_55> Jagdish Sheth and Rajendra Sisodia show why every market is dominated by three big players, and those companies who aren't specialists serving well-defined niches will either be swallowed up or destroyed. Here's a well-researched and original study of market dynamics that offers a new perspective on how markets really work.

Rob Adams is not one to mince words. In A Good Hard Kick in the Ass <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609609505/ref=mk_del_256931_60> the Texas-based venture capitalist aims to smash the illusions and wishful thinking that drive so many entrepreneurs. The gist of Adams's book is this: building a successful business is not about great ideas; it's about execution of business fundamentals.

In the Wake of Enron 	
  <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/delivers/horizi.gif>
  <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/delivers/shadow.gif>

In the future, the Enron debacle may be seen as a fitting epitaph to the stock boom and bust of the last few years. Enron's maniacal focus on pumping up the bottom line to lift its stock price has left many investors wondering whether or not other companies have "Enroned" their financial results. For others, the Enron collapse is yet another confirmation of what's wrong with corporate America's preoccupation with enhancing shareholder value at the expense of social and ethical obligations. This selection of books not only considers the role of corporations, but offers help in evaluating what companies actually disclose about themselves and their business.

by Lawrence E. Mitchell 
In Corporate Irresponsibility <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300090234/ref=mk_del_256931_86> Lawrence Mitchell believes that the focus on short-term results and the legal system that supports them have blinded companies from acting in responsible ways toward their employees, the environment, and the political system--ultimately undermining those companies' long-term survival. Mitchell's suggestions for reform include annual, rather than quarterly, earning reports; increasing incentives for long-term stockholding; and separating corporate management from stockholder pressure.

The Divine Right of Capital: Dethroning the Corporate Aristocracy <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1576751252/ref=mk_del_256931_90>     Icon <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/icon-books.gif>
by Marjorie Kelly 
Marjorie Kelly takes a radical view of the modern corporation. She believes that the mandate to maximize shareholder returns has created an aristocracy in which shareholders own corporations, but "contribute very little, and take quite a lot." In her view, employees--who are responsible for creating the wealth of the corporation--don't receive a fair reward for their labor, and are in fact "not citizens of corporate society, but subjects" (something former Enron employees might identify with). While I doubt many corporate leaders will be lining up to support Kelly's call for a truly "democratic capitalist system," her views in the wake of the Enron case will surely get a second hearing.

With the Enron debacle dominating not just the business page, but the front page, it seems like a good opportunity to look at two recent books that speak to the problems of corporate accountability (or lack thereof), Corporate Irresponsibility <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300090234/ref=mk_del_256931_39> and The Divine Right of Capital <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1576751252/ref=mk_del_256931_40>. Also, Joseph Badaracco's Leading Quietly <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1578514878/ref=mk_del_256931_41> gets on my shortlist of candidates for best business book of the year. This is a leadership book that takes its cue not from the boardrooms of corporate America, but from the more mundane situations and decisions that most of us face in business every day. Also featured in this mailing is a list of the top 10 business books of 2001 as selected by the editors of Harvard Business Review <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005U5EB/ref=mk_del_256931_42>.

by Joseph L. Badaracco 
Most books on business leadership tend to focus on the high-profile Fortune 500 types--the Jack Welches, the Bill Gateses, and the Michael Dells. According to Joseph Badaracco, however, this view of leadership is incredibly narrow because it ignores the fact that "the vast majority of problems calling for leadership are everyday situations" faced by managers up and down the corporate hierarchy. In Leading Quietly <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1578514878/ref=mk_del_256931_45> Badaracco uses real-life examples to illustrate eight guidelines of what quiet leadership means.

Bill Jensen turns the tables on corporate management and asks, "Why should we work for you?" For Jensen, the answer goes way beyond compensation and benefits. In Work 2.0 <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738205699/ref=mk_del_256931_50>, he lays out a new contract based on the realization that in this networked and knowledge-based economy, employees are a company's number-one asset and its most important investor.

by Jagdish Sheth, Rajendra Sisodia 
McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's; Bank of America, Chase Manhattan, and Bank One; American, United, and Delta. What do these companies have in common? In The Rule of Three <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/074320560X/ref=mk_del_256931_55> Jagdish Sheth and Rajendra Sisodia show why every market is dominated by three big players, and those companies who aren't specialists serving well-defined niches will either be swallowed up or destroyed. Here's a well-researched and original study of market dynamics that offers a new perspective on how markets really work.

Rob Adams is not one to mince words. In A Good Hard Kick in the Ass <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609609505/ref=mk_del_256931_60> the Texas-based venture capitalist aims to smash the illusions and wishful thinking that drive so many entrepreneurs. The gist of Adams's book is this: building a successful business is not about great ideas; it's about execution of business fundamentals.

In the Wake of Enron 	
  <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/delivers/horizi.gif>
  <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/delivers/shadow.gif>

In the future, the Enron debacle may be seen as a fitting epitaph to the stock boom and bust of the last few years. Enron's maniacal focus on pumping up the bottom line to lift its stock price has left many investors wondering whether or not other companies have "Enroned" their financial results. For others, the Enron collapse is yet another confirmation of what's wrong with corporate America's preoccupation with enhancing shareholder value at the expense of social and ethical obligations. This selection of books not only considers the role of corporations, but offers help in evaluating what companies actually disclose about themselves and their business.

Corporate Irresponsibility: America`s Newest Export <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300090234/ref=mk_del_256931_85>     Icon <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/icon-books.gif>
by Lawrence E. Mitchell 
In Corporate Irresponsibility <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300090234/ref=mk_del_256931_86> Lawrence Mitchell believes that the focus on short-term results and the legal system that supports them have blinded companies from acting in responsible ways toward their employees, the environment, and the political system--ultimately undermining those companies' long-term survival. Mitchell's suggestions for reform include annual, rather than quarterly, earning reports; increasing incentives for long-term stockholding; and separating corporate management from stockholder pressure.

The Divine Right of Capital: Dethroning the Corporate Aristocracy <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1576751252/ref=mk_del_256931_90>     Icon <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/icon-books.gif>
by Marjorie Kelly 
Marjorie Kelly takes a radical view of the modern corporation. She believes that the mandate to maximize shareholder returns has created an aristocracy in which shareholders own corporations, but "contribute very little, and take quite a lot." In her view, employees--who are responsible for creating the wealth of the corporation--don't receive a fair reward for their labor, and are in fact "not citizens of corporate society, but subjects" (something former Enron employees might identify with). While I doubt many corporate leaders will be lining up to support Kelly's call for a truly "democratic capitalist system," her views in the wake of the Enron case will surely get a second hearing.
