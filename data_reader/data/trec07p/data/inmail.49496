Log:
Dropped : from all listop contextualizers, whether sigil and typename.
The @@ contextualizer is now also named "slice".
Consistent with that, we have regularized slice nomenclature:
* A "slice" now always refers to the whole multidimensional subscript,
    or the list of lists corresponding to that.
* We now try to avoid calling the individual sublists "slices".
* The parameter to a subscript is *@@slice, not *@@slices.
* The term "multislice" is now deemed redundant.

 routine, array, or hash.  The long forms are as follows:
 
     method postcircumfix:<( )> (|$capture) {...}
-    method postcircumfix:<[ ]> (*@@slices) {...}
-    method postcircumfix:<{ }> (*@@slices) {...}
+    method postcircumfix:<[ ]> (*@@slice) {...}
+    method postcircumfix:<{ }> (*@@slice) {...}
 
 Those are a bit unwieldy, so you may also use these short forms:
 
     method &.( |$capture ) {...}
-    method @.[ *@@slices ] {...}
-    method %.{ *@@slices } {...}
+    method @.[ *@@slice ] {...}
+    method %.{ *@@slice } {...}
 
 The sigil-dot sequence in these short forms autogenerates the
 corresponding public operators, in exactly the same way that
