How are you doing? Still with us in the little boat? :)

Have you and Jim talked about setting up the infrastructure?

I won't be able to attend the meeting on Friday.   I have an eye doctor's appointment at 9:30, so it is also unlikely that I will be able to call in, unless I am pleasantly surprised and he is running on time!  I will take the dial in number with me to the appointment in the event that I am somewhere in the process that allows me to dial in.  --Sally
