Geoff  - While I was reading the newspaper on Sunday, I saw the article about your father.  I was so shocked to learn of your loss.  You and your family are in our prayers.  After I lost my father, I went through a very difficult period.  But my faith and my family certainly did help me get through that time in my life more than 5 years ago.
 
Again, my deepest sympathy to you and your family.  You are definitely in my thoughts and prayers.
