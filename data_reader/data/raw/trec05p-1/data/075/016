Hello and welcome back to Weekly Career Update! 

This week, we're trying to shed a tiny bit of light on the decision to get an MBA. According to a recent Vault poll, over half of Vault readers were considering going back to school to ride out the enfeebled economy - with 36 percent indicating that they wouldn't mind giving the MBA a try. But is this the best decision for you? MBAs cost upwards of $60,000, not to mention two years of prime earning potential. Read on and see what you think. 

Have you ever thought about writing for Weekly Career Update? Drop us a line! 

And have a good week. Take care,

Are you stagnating in your career, envious of the big bucks your friends are making now that they've won the right to add those coveted three letters to their resumes, or simply looking to make a change? The decision to go to business school can be prompted by many different reasons. Not all of them are worth giving up two years of salary, putting a career on hold, and assuming substantial debt, not to mention the personal sacrifices an MBA program requires. Yet many people make the plunge before fully considering the implications and risks of their decision. So if you're contemplating getting an MBA, ask yourself some questions before you enroll. 

It is critically important to have a clear idea of what you hope to accomplish in getting an MBA. Is your decision driven by a need to compete on a level playing field with your colleagues, advance to the next level in your career, expand the range of available career options and maximize your earnings potential, or do you simply hope to "change your life"? Your answers to these questions should help you to decide whether an MBA is for you and if so, what type of program makes the most sense (i.e., full time, part time, or executive). Alternatively, maybe your needs could be met with individual courses or a certificate program through the continuing education departments many universities maintain.

A Vault member writes:

I am now interviewing for a position abroad (Asia) and the process is going well. However, today I suddenly realized that I submitted an old draft of my resume to the employer. It states that I was at ABC Company for an entire year. In actual fact I was there for only 5 months and worked for another similiar company before that for 7 months (both of these were contract work). I'm concerned that if I change this now on my resume, they will view it as something I was misrepresenting. However, if I don't set the record straight now, I'm concerned that my reference (he has written me a recommendation letter) at ABC Company(the 5 month previous employer) will bring this to light when he is questioned about my work history and my chances at this job will be blown. What do you recommend?

Want to work for the CIA?

Who said CIA agents were secretive? Insiders at the CIA give helpful advice about how to learn more about the agency and where potential applicants might find their talents best served. It all happens on Vault's CIA message board <http://www.vault.com/community/mb/mb_main.jsp?forum_id=5443>.

Risky Business

Quit your day job. That's right, quit your day job. Just think of the possibilities: waking up at the crack of noon, lounging with a cup of coffee and The View, reading the paper, rearranging your spice rack, and, oh yeah, meeting strict deadlines and being constantly harassed by overworked editors who have no qualms about calling at all hours of the day to see how you're progressing on that article on the stamp collecting trade in Hungary. 

Although many people possess the ability to weave cogent prose in order to move product or to get you to read the entire backside of a box of cereal, not nearly as many are cut out for the world of freelance writing. It's a wide-open proposition - one day you can write a brilliant treatise on the effect Voltaire's Candide has had on modern satire and the next you'll be knee-deep in product write-ups for pet chew toys. 

Read on to see if you're cut out for the life of a freelance writer. Head for Vault <http://www.vault.com/go/to.jsp?place=15505>.

Hello and welcome back to Weekly Career Update! 

This week, we're trying to shed a tiny bit of light on the decision to get an MBA. According to a recent Vault poll, over half of Vault readers were considering going back to school to ride out the enfeebled economy - with 36 percent indicating that they wouldn't mind giving the MBA a try. But is this the best decision for you? MBAs cost upwards of $60,000, not to mention two years of prime earning potential. Read on and see what you think. 

Have you ever thought about writing for Weekly Career Update? Drop us a line! 

And have a good week. Take care,

Are you stagnating in your career, envious of the big bucks your friends are making now that they've won the right to add those coveted three letters to their resumes, or simply looking to make a change? The decision to go to business school can be prompted by many different reasons. Not all of them are worth giving up two years of salary, putting a career on hold, and assuming substantial debt, not to mention the personal sacrifices an MBA program requires. Yet many people make the plunge before fully considering the implications and risks of their decision. So if you're contemplating getting an MBA, ask yourself some questions before you enroll. 

It is critically important to have a clear idea of what you hope to accomplish in getting an MBA. Is your decision driven by a need to compete on a level playing field with your colleagues, advance to the next level in your career, expand the range of available career options and maximize your earnings potential, or do you simply hope to "change your life"? Your answers to these questions should help you to decide whether an MBA is for you and if so, what type of program makes the most sense (i.e., full time, part time, or executive). Alternatively, maybe your needs could be met with individual courses or a certificate program through the continuing education departments many universities maintain.

A Vault member writes:

I am now interviewing for a position abroad (Asia) and the process is going well. However, today I suddenly realized that I submitted an old draft of my resume to the employer. It states that I was at ABC Company for an entire year. In actual fact I was there for only 5 months and worked for another similiar company before that for 7 months (both of these were contract work). I'm concerned that if I change this now on my resume, they will view it as something I was misrepresenting. However, if I don't set the record straight now, I'm concerned that my reference (he has written me a recommendation letter) at ABC Company(the 5 month previous employer) will bring this to light when he is questioned about my work history and my chances at this job will be blown. What do you recommend?

Want to work for the CIA?

Who said CIA agents were secretive? Insiders at the CIA give helpful advice about how to learn more about the agency and where potential applicants might find their talents best served. It all happens on Vault's CIA message board <http://www.vault.com/community/mb/mb_main.jsp?forum_id=5443>.

Risky Business

Quit your day job. That's right, quit your day job. Just think of the possibilities: waking up at the crack of noon, lounging with a cup of coffee and The View, reading the paper, rearranging your spice rack, and, oh yeah, meeting strict deadlines and being constantly harassed by overworked editors who have no qualms about calling at all hours of the day to see how you're progressing on that article on the stamp collecting trade in Hungary. 

Although many people possess the ability to weave cogent prose in order to move product or to get you to read the entire backside of a box of cereal, not nearly as many are cut out for the world of freelance writing. It's a wide-open proposition - one day you can write a brilliant treatise on the effect Voltaire's Candide has had on modern satire and the next you'll be knee-deep in product write-ups for pet chew toys. 

Read on to see if you're cut out for the life of a freelance writer. Head for Vault <http://www.vault.com/go/to.jsp?place=15505>.
