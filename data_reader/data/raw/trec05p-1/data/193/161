IN THE NEWS...
Diabetes Care Not Linked to Learning Problems
Researchers at the University of Iowa have good news for children with type 1 diabetes.  A recent study conducted there found that children with type 1 diabetes do not experience any learning problems from their diabetes treatments.  The findings, which counter earlier research linking diabetes treatment to learning troubles, appear in the January issue of the journal Pediatrics.

Managing Stress Could Help Control Blood Sugar
Stress has often been associated with elevated blood sugar in people with diabetes, but until now, there have been no large clinical studies exploring how stress management therapy might help people with the disease control their blood sugar.  New research reported by Richard Surwit, PhD., and a team from the Duke University Medical Center, found that people with type 2 diabetes that incorporate stress management into their daily lives can significantly improve blood sugar control.  The study was published in the January, 2002 issue of Diabetes Care.

Mothers Who Smoke Could Create Diabetes Risk
Recent research from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden finds another reason for people not to smoke.  The children of women who smoke during pregnancy could be at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes and obesity later in life, according to the new study published in this month's British Medical Journal.

Florida Newborns Offered Diabetes Screening
Florida will soon be the first U.S. state to offer every newborn a chance to be screened for risk of type 1 diabetes.  A voluntary program funded by a $10 million endowment created by the American Diabetes Association, the new initiative will identify babies at high risk for the disease and continue to monitor them throughout their lives.  The program will be based at the University of Florida College of Medicine and become available within 1 1/2 years.

NEWLY SCHEDULED! Healthcare Financing in the 21st Century: Cost Implications for Employers, Insurers and Policy Makers, co-sponsored by the American Diabetes Association
Considerable attention and emphasis is given to medical decision-making that addresses the impact of disease on the direct costs of treatment; however, most current decision-making paradigms ignore the patient and family costs and the impacts of disease and treatment on worker productivity.  Indirect costs constitute more than half of total health care costs for most diseases. This conference aims to focus on three specific actions plans to address these indirect costs.
