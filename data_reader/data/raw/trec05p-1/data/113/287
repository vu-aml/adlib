Tracy,

I'm sure you have no time for this now, but I wanted to get this information to you as soon as I had it.  I am very concerned to learn that only a part (approximately 1/3 or $680,000) was allocated out to EGS units as part of Steve Kean's budget.  (A disproportionately high $600,000 was allocated to EGM and the remaining $738,000 was retained at corp.)  It is my understanding that $470,000 was budgeted for the ETS communications group.  

Recognizing that my proposed corp. budget already reflected a decrease of approximately $ 1 million from the 2001 budget and $5 million from its 2000 budgets, it will be tight, but we could do our work as an EGS group if we were able to get the EGS allocations ($680,000), ETS communications budget ($470,000) and the portion that was unallocated corp. ($738,000), for a total of $1,888,000.  

I presume the problem with this is that it includes $738,000, which was not allocated to EGS entities.  Do you think this can be accommodated or should we look at keeping the budget at corp., with a reporting line to Stan?  (I have not broached this with Stan.)  I've attached spreadsheets with my corp. budget and Gina Taylor's ETS budget.  When you have time, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this with you.

Thanks,

John

Have the Steve Kean numbers been included in his budget and allocated out for 2002?

Thanks

Tracy,

Thank you!  These meetings are very helpful in better understanding the business.  I'm currently scheduled to be in Korea, but may change plans and will let you know.  

By the way, Rod had suggested that I hold off on bothering you about my group's budget until after you complete this enormous endeavor.  However, FYI, I had submitted an approximately $2 million budget through Steve Kean's group and about $300,000 was submitted for Gina Taylor's group in the ETS budget.  I'm probably going to identify some reductions in these numbers.  Please let me know when you need details.

Thanks,

John
