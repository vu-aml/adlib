Carl:

This will confirm the agreement of PG&E not to take any action for 48 hours
with respect to our ongoing disputes with Enron.  We will meet with you and
your client tomorrow in an effort to formulate a process for resolution of
outstanding issues.

Obviously, this is without prejudice to anyone's rights.
