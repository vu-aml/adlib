Hi Jeff,

I'm looking at your transcript and you've already completed 30 
units.  You're taking 7 units this semester for a total of 37 units.  You 
need 40 units to graduate.

You may want to consider adding a 3-unit this semester.  Or next semester 3 
units will cost about half, $6000.  4 or more units full price.  Just let 
me know if you want to add another class, but you may not have the time!

Just ask at our front desk, and we'll make you a copy of your latest 
transcript.

You can go to the Deals class tonight, even though you're #17 on the 
waiting list.  I'll update the status on Friday.  You may want to have a 
back-up!

See you,
TJ
