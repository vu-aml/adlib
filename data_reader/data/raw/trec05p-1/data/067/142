below.&nbsp; I<BR>&gt; Added many of my own statements, as I have been
asked the

some of

writing.<BR>&gt;
<BR>&gt; How many of us have heard that question "Where was your GOD
when
the<BR>&gt; World Trade Center and the Pentagon was attacked?"&nbsp;
Well I know
where <BR>my<BR>&gt; GOD was the morning of September 11, 2001, and He
was very
busy!<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; He was trying to discourage anyone from taking
these
flights. Those <BR>four<BR>&gt; flights together held over 1000
passengers and
there were only 266<BR>&gt; aboard.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; He was on 4
commercial
flights giving terrified passengers the <BR>ability<BR>&gt; to stay
calm. Not
one of the family members who were called by a <BR>loved<BR>&gt; one on
one of
the high-jacked planes said that passengers were <BR>screaming<BR>&gt;
in the
background.&nbsp; On one of the flights he was giving strength
to<BR>&gt;
passengers to try to overtake the hijackers.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; He was
busy trying
to create obstacles for employees at the World <BR>Trade<BR>&gt; Center.
After
all, only around 20,000 were at the towers when the <BR>first<BR>&gt;
jet hit.
Since the buildings held over 50,000 workers, this was a
<BR>Miracle<BR>&gt; in
itself. How many of the people who were employed at the World
<BR>Trade<BR>&gt;
Center told the media that they were late for work or they had
<BR>traffic<BR>&gt; delays.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; He was holding up two
110-story
buildings so that 2/3 of the workers<BR>&gt; Could get out. I was so
amazed that
the top of the towers didn't <BR>topple<BR>&gt; when the jets
impacted.&nbsp;
And when they did fall, they fell inward.&nbsp; <BR>GOD<BR>&gt; didn't
allow
them to topple over, as many more lives would have been
<BR>lost.<BR>&gt;
<BR>&gt; And when the buildings went down, my GOD picked up almost 6,000
of
<BR>his<BR>&gt; children and carried them home with him.&nbsp;
Reassuring his
frightened<BR>&gt; children that the worst was over and the best was yet
to
come.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; He sat down and cried that 19 of his children
could have
so much hate<BR>&gt; in their hearts.&nbsp; That they didn't choose him,
but
another god that<BR>&gt; doesn't exist, and now they are lost
forever.<BR>&gt;
<BR>&gt; He sent his children that are best trained for this disaster
and
had<BR>&gt; them save the few that were still alive, but unable to help
<BR>themselves.<BR>&gt; And then sent many others to help in any way
they were
needed.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; He still wasn't finished though. He held the
loved ones
that were <BR>left<BR>&gt; behind in his arms.&nbsp; He comforts them
daily.&nbsp; His other children are<BR>&gt; given the strength to reach
out to
them and help them in any way they <BR>can.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; And I
believe he
will continue to help us with what is to come.&nbsp; He <BR>will<BR>&gt;
give
the people in charge of this great nation the strength and the
