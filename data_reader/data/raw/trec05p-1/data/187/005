Some of you are still alive and playing in your Championship this 
week.  Some of you completed their seasons last week or before.  For 
those still alive, here is the news that you need to know:

General News:

Tampa Bay is expected to rest a lot of players in this game.  They do 
not need the game and will likely sit Warrick Dunn.  Brad Johnson and 
Keyshawn Johnson may play only a half.  Doug Brien will also give 
Martin Gramatica another week to heal.  

Pittsburgh will likely rest some of their players this week  Jerome 
Bettis could start, but probably will not.  Hines Ward and Kordell 
Stewart may only play a half.  Don't expect Kordell to take off
on many runs this week either.

Philadelphia is expected to rest the majority of their stars.  Chad 
Lewis and James Thrash are not expected to play.  Duce Staley may 
play.  Donovan McNabb is likely to only to play a half.

The Rams will either be full throttle or resting their stars.  If 
Chicago wins, expect Warner and Faulk to be huge.  If Chicago loses, 
both could be spelled this week.

And now onto the individual players:


Quarterbacks in the News:

Chris Chandler (Atl) missed practice on Friday and isn't expected
to play.  He appears on the injury report as doubtful with a sore 
elbow.  Michael Vick will start in his place.

ankle.

Tony Martin (Atl) was released by the Falcons this week.  Shawn

questionable to play at receiver.  He may return kicks.  He appears

on Thursday and are expected to play on Sunday despite various 
injuries.  Oronde Gadsden appears on the injury report as 
questionable with a sore hamstring.  James McKnight also appears as 
questionable with a bruised face.  Chris Chambers is probable with an 
ankle injury.  

Cris Carter (Min) has missed practice all week with a cracked rib.  
He is very questionable to play and will likely be a gametime 
decision.  If he cannot go, Jake Reed will start opposite of Randy 
Moss.

Randy Moss (Min) hasn't done anything stupid this week…yet.

Terry Glenn (NE) was given Wednesday off for personal reasons.  I am 
guessing he needs a lot more days off.  Glenn practiced on Thursday 
and will play as the #3 WR this week.

Jerry Rice (Oak) is away from the team to be with his ailing father.  
It is unclear whether he will make it to the game on Sunday.  If he 
does not play, Jerry Porter and James Jett would split time opposite 
of Tim Brown.

sprained ankle and appears on the injury report as doubtful.

Koren Robinson (Sea) has been benched in favor of James Williams.  
James will start opposite of Darrell Jackson this week.

Keyshawn Johnson (TB) may be held out this week to get healthy for 
the playoffs.  His status will likely not be known until gametime.  
He appears on the injury report as questionable with a bad ankle.  If 
he does play, it will likely not be an entire game.

Reidell Anthony (TB) appears on the injury report as probable, but is 
expected to play.  

Michael Westbrook (Was) was unable to practice on Thursday and may 
not be able to go on Sunday.  He appears on the injury report as 
questionable with a sore ankle. Kevin Lockett would start in his 
place if he cannot go.

like he will play on Sunday.  He appears on the injury report as 
doubtful with bruised ribs.

Greg Clark (SF) is out again this week.  He also is not expected to 
play in the playoffs either.

Dave Moore (TB) appears on the injury report as questionable with a 
thigh bruise.  He is not likely to make a big contribution since the 
game means little to the Bucs.

expected to start on Sunday.  He appears on the injury report as 
questionable with a thigh bruise.  


***************************************************
