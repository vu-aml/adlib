"What I like best is a book that's at least funny once in a while... what really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it.  That doesn't happen much, though.  -- J.D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye",
