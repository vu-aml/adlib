Mr. Li Shi Ju
Hokkaido Bank,
Kita 7 Jou Branch,
North 7 West 4, Sapporo,
Hokkaido 060-8628,Japan.

Dear Sir,

Please do not be embarrased by this unusual email with the request I am 
about to make. Before going further let me introduce myself, I am Mr. Li Shi 
Ju credit officer of the Hokkaido Bank in Japan and accounts officer to 
General. Anderson Ernest Elwood  , the subject of my request to you.

Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Anderson Ernest Elwood  who 
was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a fixed deposit for 270 
days, with a value of ($18.5 M)Eighteen million Five Hundred Thousand United 
State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notices were sent to 
him, even during the war early Last year.

Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response 
came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been 
killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.

After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Elwood did not 
declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of 
his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my 
office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, $18.5 
Million is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim 
it.

What is most disturbing is that according to the  laws of my country at the 
expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Japanese 
Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my 
suggestion to you is that I will like you as
a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Elwood so that you will be 
able to receive his funds.

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall 
come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the 
necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen.Elwood, 
all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with 
your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After 
you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in for 
claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of 
probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be 
provided by you.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank 
account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for you .

Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax
numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details
of this operation.

Please reply through this EMAIL: credit_officer@hokkaido-bank-jp.com

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards

Mr. Li Shi Ju
