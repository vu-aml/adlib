Aaron,

Please find attached our proposed futures and options commission schedule for Enron Corporation. Although you will be trading mainly European interest rate futures, I have included an exhaustive list of contracts and exchanges in Europe, N America and Asia Pacific. Take note that all proposed clearing rates include exchange fees. This explains why Eurex is cheaper than both LIFFE and US exchanges as they charge lower exchange fees. In the columns moving across the spreadsheet from left to right, you will see our proposed execution fee, and clearing fee followed by a full service rate. We have provided a discount on the full service rate to encourage you to use Deutsche Bank for both execution and clearing of exchange traded products. Finally you will find a column headed Ex-Link FS. This represents the full service rate if you use our electronic execution platform (Exchange Link).

I hope this proposal meets your approval. If you have any questions or comments please do not hesitate to contact me

                                                  (See attached file: C07sept2001.xls)

I invite you to get back to me at your earliest convenience to tell me how (or if) you would like to take this forward.


Regards

Kelly McKenney
