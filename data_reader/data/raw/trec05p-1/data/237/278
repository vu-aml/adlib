     A  physician  warned  him  his  health  was  precarious, so

     ambitions  and  searched  for a salubrious climate where he
     might try farming.
     --"Teeing  Off  Into  the  Past  At  Oakhurst," [1]New York
     Times, May 2, 1999

     For years, her mother has maintained that the sea air has a
     salubrious effect on both her spirits and her vocal cords.
     --Anita Shreve, [2]Fortune's Rocks

     Uptown,  however,  the  tanners' less salubrious quarter is

     --"Byzantium," [3]Toronto Star, February 7, 1999
