Spie,
In perhaps similar situations where there are clusters of measurements
due to repeated time or space on an individual subject or experimental
unit, I have used the survreg() function from the survival library. 

You can specify left, right, and/or interval censoring within a data set
through Surv(), and so I have used left censoring for the LOD
observations. I was just focused on marginal or population-averaged
estimation, so the use of cluster() in the argument for survreg() and
the robust option in survreg() to get sandwich error estimates was
sufficient for me. Depending on your needs to evaluate random effects,
frailty() in the survival package -- which can be used with survreg() or
coxph() --- is another alternative to explore, I believe.

Hope that helps,
Bill
