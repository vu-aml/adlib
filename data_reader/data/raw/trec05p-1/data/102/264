 Regarding the GISB,  issues remaining are Section 3.2 Performance Obl. and their Guaranty.

We prefer Spot Standard for Section 3.2 however, they argue the Cilco city gate does not have a "Spot Market" .  If the city gate is their end user I will give on this point.  Tammy is checking on this.  The only other issue is their Guaranty to Enron.  I have no problem with amending the gty or putting a new one in place.  Having said that, I would prefer they draft the amendment.  This of course is contingent on credits ok with the change in the gty amount.

FYI, I will be out to the office tomorrow afternoon for meetings. If you need me leave a message with my assistant and I will call you back.
