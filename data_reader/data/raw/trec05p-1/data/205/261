Kevin,
 
It was good to talk with you this morning.  As mentioned to you yesterday, following is some information on a project that I've been working on.  I'd appreciate your assitance in getting the word out regarding this project.   

As you are aware, there are many families that have been affected by the recent layoffs at Enron.  I along with two other ex-employees (Karen Cutler and Sue Nix) have been working on a project which will provide assistance to ex-employees of Enron. We wanted to do something to help our fellow employees and also provide a tool that others could use to provide assistance to ex-Enron employees.   Just think, if 100 people donated $50 each that would be $5000 that we could give to ex-employees for assistance as needed for basic necessities (such as money for food, to pay their rent/mortgage, or utilites).  I know the ex-employees would really appreciate this assistance.  I've already started getting e-mails at eerfarequest@surfmk.com <mailto:eerfarequest@surfmk.com> requesting assistance.  We've set up guidelines on how we'll be distributing the funds. This week, we've been working with an attorney and a local bank. An account has been set up where people can make contributions. All the money will be given back to ex-Enron employees that need assistance with basic necessities, such as money for food, rent/mortgage payments, and utilities. We've contacted the local media with the information so that the community can be made aware of what we're doing. Our ability to provide assistance will be based on the response we receive.  As you can see, we're using our values from Enron to help others, and would appreciate your assistance with communicating this information to the current Enron employees.  

Please send this information in a general announcement to the current Enron employees so they can be aware of a way to help their fellow ex-employees.  If you need to speak with me or have any questions, I can be reached at 281-812-2466.  

Contributions can be made to: 

Humble Community Bank 
1515 FM 1960 Bypass East 
Humble, Texas 77338 
281-540-1414 
Account name: E.E.R.F.A. (stands for Enron Ex-Employee Relief Fund Account) 

Assistance requests for basic needs from ex-employees of Enron can be sent to: 
e-mail: eerfarequest@surfmk.com <mailto:eerfarequest@surfmk.com> 
fax: 281-812-2543

Thank you in advance for assisting with getting this information out.  I hope that you and your family have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

Rebekah Rushing
