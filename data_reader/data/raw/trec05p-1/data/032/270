Here is my proposal for a definition of Delivery Point to address the risk that RTO-West will change the existing delivery points to a zonal system:


Delivery Point:  Mid-C or, if the Delivery Point of Mid-C ceases to exist or is modified by RTO-West or similar entity, the zone, physical location, or bus that reasonably resembles Mid-C in terms of liquidity, homogeneity, and physical location. 

Any suggestions?

Steve
