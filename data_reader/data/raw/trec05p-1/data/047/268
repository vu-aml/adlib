As soon as I saw the problem (early Sunday morning), I left a Voice message
on Jeff's phone, Prentice's phone and also a live message with the paging
service for Jeff.  When it was time to determine what to do (i.e., the games
were about to start),  I looked at the scores on Tennessee and Seattle and
both were fairly high in the picks - Tenn ave. of 10.  so I figured that you
must have meant to put 11 on one of your #12 teams.  I put the #12 on the
team that alphabetically came first, put 11 on Tennessee, and lowered all
remaining numbers to come back to 1.  (You did not have a 1 pick in what you
sent.)  I honestly did what I thought you were trying to do, so I'm sorry if
it wasn't the right thing.

Donna had come over to watch the game, so I couldn't really talk when you
called the last time and even though you were trying to give me what you
meant, the Seattle game was already over, so I don't think it would have
been fair to change it at that point.  

Did you have a marvelous time???  Did they like the tomatoes?
