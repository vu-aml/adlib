Fred, sorry for not getting back to you sooner, but I understand you were in communication with Mark Taylor.  Thanks for the quick turn around and excellent and thorough analysis.  I have both read and understand the analysis.  I am somewhat concerned regarding the final comment regarding ASC's scrutiny of EOL, but other than being careful, I am not sure what we can do.

With respect to transactions with counterparties who are not "Qualified Parties", it is almost inconceivable given the breadth of the "commercial user" exemption and the representations obtained in our contract that we would ever transact with a counterparty which is not a Qualified Party.

Regards, Peter
