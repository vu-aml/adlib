John -- Couple comments
Transmission (Federal and State Jurisdiction:)-- I did not fully understand "States have no jurisdiction over transmission facilities, and this provision prevents large industrial customers from tying directly into the transmission grid and avoiding state charges."  There is bypass to the interstate pipelines now.  It seems that industrials should be able to connect to the interstate grid, especially when they have onsite generation that they want to sell into the grid.

Market Power -- Market Monitoring: In the SE RTO mediation, I raised this possibility about FERC having regional offices and being the market monitor instead of establishing these elaborate MM structures.  Everyone thought that this is a Day 5 or 6 possibility and many of the munis and coops really want the elaborate structures (separate MM company, etc.), at least initially.

Electricity Supply: Interconnection Standard:  "pay direct costs"  -- direct costs should not include network upgrades that benefit other customers of the grid.  FERC recently issued an order in a Consumers case that said interconnection customers do not have to pay the network upgrades (they are rolled into rates).  This is something Enron encounters on most every interconnection we attempt -- the utilities typically put in all kinds of costs and try to direct bill us.

Federal Electric Utilies:  TVA power sales:  "Limit TVA wholesale power sales outside the region to sales of excess power..."  Under the current scheduling rules (day ahead balanced schedule requirement), TVA could have alot of latitude and discretion in what it calls "excess".  If we get the congestion management we want, this would be less of a problem.

	Regulation of TVA trans. system:  "(TVA has argued Federal law prevents..."  I thought TVA was saying it is difficult for TVA to join an RTO, not impossible under current law (they raised the letter that BPA apparently received encouraging it to join an RTO).

Real time pricing is good. 
Thanks.

The attached from EPSA is reportedly the detailed outline of the Administration's electricity bill that hit the street late yesterday and today.  I am awaiting confirmation that this is it, but it appears to be.  One more proposal to crank into the mix.
