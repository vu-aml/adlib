well.
now that i've got your interest....

hello and hi and i'm still unemployed but working as
location scout (for free) on a short independant film
that my friend joe bini is directing... and we need a
couple of interior shots that would take one day to
film...

would you be interested in letting us taking over your
place for one day? it's a rather invasive thing,
having a movie shot in one's home, but it would only
be for one day, and everything would be cleaned up
afterwards just like new and fancy....

also, it will probably be a cool little film, as
werner herzog is doing the voice over (for sure) and
may (good possibility) play the lead.

there would be no payment for your graciousness, but
you would get a copy of the film and an invite to the
premier! it will hopefully enter some film
festivals...

thanks for letting me know if you're interested,
and kisses to both of you!!!

colleen
