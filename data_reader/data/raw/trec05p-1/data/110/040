Well, I did get all of my laundry done.  I went and picked up the uniform
and then went to a couple parties, they were fun.  I has my soccer game and
it sucked.  I think everyone on my team was hung over, and we lost.  I went
out to lunch and then to the mall, I bought some new jeans.  Later, I went
out to dinner and then to Fred Meyer.  It was very exciting.  Is there day
light savings time there?  I'm glad you had fun with your friend.  Did you
sleep in the same bed?  I only have a four day work week.  I am taking
Friday off for the surgury.  I am not yet freaking out, but I probably will
later.  I am tired and out of it today...moving a little slow.

Let's see...I worked a little on Sunday, but wasn't too motivated
because of all of the turmoil at the company.  Weather was really nice,
so Mark and I went to a bar that's half outside to watch some football.
Only thing is, the one game we wanted to watch, wasn't on.  At least
there was plenty of beer.  Then we went home and grilled some steaks.  I
like steak.  That's about it.  How about you?  Did you get all of your
laundry done.  I didn't.
