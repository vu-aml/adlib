COURT SEES NO DUTY TO BARGAIN FOR SUBSIDIARIES OPERATING
"NEW YORK POST"

Two companies that successively operated the "New York Post
" were not required to recognize and bargain with the
Newspaper Guild of New York, the Second Circuit rules
("Newspaper Guild of N.Y. v. NLRB,  "2d Cir.,  No. 00-4222,
8/10/01).

Affirming the National Labor Relations Board's ruling in
favor of NYP Acquisition Corp. and NYP Holdings Inc., Judge
Jacobs holds that the board was reasonable in finding that
NYP Acquisition--launched in 1993 to manage the
then-bankrupt newspaper--and NYP Holdings--later launched to
buy the paper--were not alter egos because they played
different transactional roles and had different financial
and strategic purposes. Nor were the two subsidiaries of
Rupert Murdoch's News American Publishing Inc. a single
employer, the court holds, because they did not operate
concurrently. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-21

TEXAS COURT UPSETS $5.8 MILLION VERDICT FOR FORMER AMERICAN
EAGLE PILOT

The Texas Court of Appeals overturns a more than $5.8
million judgment for a former American Eagle pilot who
claimed he was fired for refusing to fly in an ice storm
("Simmons Airlines d/b/a American Eagle v. Lagrotte, "Tex.
Ct. App., No. 05-00-00656-CV, 8/3/01). The appeals court
decides the trial court should not have allowed Michael
Lagrotte to bring a wrongful discharge tort claim when he
was covered by a collective bargaining contract that
specified he could only be fired for "just cause," and he
had access to grievance/arbitration procedures to challenge
his discharge. Lagrotte filed a grievance but withdrew it,
opting instead to go to court.

A jury in the Dallas County District Court found American
Eagle acted with malice in terminating Lagrotte for the sole
reason that he refused to perform an illegal act. The jury
awarded $2,354,504 in actual damages and $7 million in
exemplary damages, but the trial judge reduced the exemplary
damages to $3,459,008. The trial judge denied the company's
motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a
new trial. . . . Page A-1

FIRM NOT LIABLE FOR OVERTIME DESPITE POLICY OF CUTTING PAY
FOR SICK LEAVE

An office manager and bookkeeper fails to convince the Tenth
Circuit that because of her employer's policy of reducing
pay for sick leave under certain circumstances she was
eligible for overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act
("Gagnon v. Resource Tech. Inc., "10th Cir., No. 00-2410,
8/13/01). The court rejects Gloria Gagnon's contention that
she did not meet the conditions of the salary test used to
determine if she was employed in an administrative capacity
and therefore exempt from the overtime requirements of the
FLSA.

 The employer's sick leave policy did not defeat the salary
test because Gagnon failed to show that a "reduction in pay
for less than one day of sick leave would have been applied"
to employees such as herself, the court says. The Supreme
Court has held that the salary test denies exempt status
when employees are covered by a policy that permits
deductions in pay for certain reasons, such as use of sick
leave for absences of less than one day. However, Gagnon
"does not allege that any deductions were made" or that her
employer "had a policy or practice of deductions, nor does
the record suggest any reason to infer such a policy," the
court says. . . . Page A-7

JUDGE RULES DIAL CASE CAN PROCEED AS PATTERN-OR-PRACTICE
CLAIM

A federal judge rules that the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission may proceed to trial with charges of sexual
harassment at Dial Corp.'s  Aurora, Ill., soap production
plant and denies most of the company's petition for summary
judgment ("EEOC v. Dial Corp., "N.D. Ill., No. 99 C 3356,
8/9/01).

In a 46-page decision, Judge Urbom rejects the bulk of
Dial's arguments for disposal of the EEOC's lawsuit alleging
that Dial Corp. tolerated a pattern or practice of sexual
harassment and sex discrimination at the Aurora facility
dating back to July 1988. The decision paves the way for a
trial in a sexual harassment case that an EEOC official
predicts could be EEOC's biggest since its landmark
litigation against Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing of
America Inc. . . . Page A-2,  Text E-1

COURT ALLOWS CLAIMS THAT UNITED HEALTHCARE USED FAULTY
UCR-CHARGE DATA

The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York rules that claims can proceed alleging that United
Healthcare breached its Employee Retirement Income Security
Act fiduciary duties by knowingly relying on inaccurate data
for establishing usual, customary, and reasonable charges in
determining benefits ("American Med. Ass'n v. United
Healthcare Corp., "S.D.N.Y., No. 00 Civ. 2800 (LMM),
7/31/01).

The suit was brought against United Healthcare and its
affiliates by health plan participants, including
participants in American Airlines' employee health plan, the
American Medical Association, the Medical Society of the
State of New York, the Missouri State Medical Association,
and two medical care providers who treated plan participants
as "out-of-network providers."

The suit alleged that although United Healthcare is
obligated to collect and maintain "usual, customary, and
reasonable" data to support its decision to reimburse
out-of-network physicians, it "does not in fact possess UCR
data to substantiate its claims that certain fees are
greater than the usual and customary charge for such
treatment and cannot justify reimbursement at the lower
rates that United Healthcare had been reimbursing
out-of-network physicians." The court finds the allegations
sufficient to state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.
However, it dismisses a claim for relief and says the
plaintiffs cannot seek the recalculation of their benefits.
