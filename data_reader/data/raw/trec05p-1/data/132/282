Bob, Jean, Scott, and I drafted this up. They are intended to be the front and back for 3 laminated cards. They provide
the plan for responding to a very short notice or no notice evacuation of the Enron Building. The first card is for what 
I have called (we can rename the group) the BCP 1st Responders. This would include the BCP Directors and Coordinators, 
ETS Business and IT Team Leads, Mgrs, Dirs, VPs, and key staff, and ENW Contacts. The second card is for the OCC. 
The third card is for the remainder of the ETS BCP Team members, both Business and IT staff. 

Jean is touching up the OCC ETS BCP defined call burst groups and messages to match this process. Bob and I will
be completing the Hangar Offsite layout, setup process, teams, and other documentation on Monday. We will get the
documentation mounted and stored at the Hangar for use during an activation. We will also get the equipment stored 
at the Hangar. 

There is a meeting planned for Tuesday, at which we should be able to finalize the initial process, and schedule the
first test. 

Get us your comments on the attachments. We tried to keep it short and simple, but with enough detail to avoid 
confusion during such an event. 

Thanks, Gary
