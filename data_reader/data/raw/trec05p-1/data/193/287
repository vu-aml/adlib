Dear Debra,

What's on your wish list? You know that list of destinations you've 
been meaning to check out "someday." With airfares lower than they've 
been in a long time, and hotel deals abounding, now's a great time to 
try something a little different, whether that's a U.S. city you've 
never visited or someplace more exotic. So what are you waiting for? 
Try something new in 2002!
