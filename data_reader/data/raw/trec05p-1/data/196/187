Good evening Sons:
 
Okay, have rented  Ford Expedition. It has 2 front bucket seats and 2 bench seats. I am assured it will comfortable seat 8. 
 
I suggest we all meet @ 5. The drive is probably only 1-1 1/2 hours, but the ship leaves @ 7 whether we are there or not. Boarding starts @ 6:30.
 
I was thinking about all meeting in the  AMC theater parking lot on the north side, @ Sam Houston Tollroad and Richmond. Plenty of lighted parking and kinda centrally located. But, I am flexible.
 
What do you guys think?-Dad
