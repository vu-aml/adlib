To:  NAM Directors & Director-Nominees:


Wanted you to know that everything is on track for the NAM Fall Board
Meeting at the Monarch Hotel in Washington, DC, October 30-31, 2001.

We have confirmations from our speakers: Secretary of State Powell,
Secretary of Treasury O'Neill, Secretary of Commerce Evans, EPA
Administrator Whitman and Senator Kennedy (D-MA).  We continue to work with
the White House, hoping for an address by the President, and that appears
quite likely.  If so, there is also a high
probability that we will go to The White House complex  for that address.
Unfortunately, because of space limitations, only NAM Directors and their
spouses will be included in that group.

With the threat of recession on everyone's mind, we will focus much of our
attention on the economy - as well as on security issues and life after
Sept. 11 - during our plenary and regional breakout sessions.  We look
forward to your active participation in these discussions about how to
achieve economic recovery and improve homeland security.

In addition to the security that is automatic with Administration officials
when they
appear before a group, we have secured the assistance of a professional firm
to assure
that our directors and guests feel safe and secure during our meeting.  

We are returning to normalcy within the city as far as air and rail travel
are concerned.  A few delays can be expected as you enter and exit the
security gates.  But I encourage you to feel confident that you will enjoy
your visit to Washington, D.C. and that we will have a great meeting!

I look forward to seeing you soon.
