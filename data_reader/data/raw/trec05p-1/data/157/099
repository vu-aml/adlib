That is not a pitfall - the package variations that our firm prop=
ose are OEM - Original Equipment Manufacturer. A retail interpret=
ation comes at a fancy box,  OEM doesn't.<BR>
How come must you give hundreds of dollars more than if you could=
 have incisively the similar merchandise only more cheaply? <BR>
You don't have to spend that much for the fancy box and manuals.<=
