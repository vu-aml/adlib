MR CHEUNG PUI
Hang Seng Bank Ltd
Sai Wan Ho Branch
171 Shaukiwan Road
Hong Kong.

Good Day,
Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Cheung
Pui director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
I have a obscured business suggestion for you.
Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi
Bassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business
man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar
months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five
Hundred Thousand United State
Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several
notice was sent to him, even during the war early this
year. Again after the war another notification was
sent and still no response came from him. We later
find out that the Major and his family had been killed
during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.
After further investigation it was also discovered
that Major Fadi Bassem did not declare any next of
kin in his official papers including the paper work of
his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last
time he was at my office that no one except me knew of
his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five
Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying
in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim
it. What bothers me most is
that according to the to the laws of my country at the
expiration 3 and half years (3yrs, 6months) the funds
will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong
Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.
Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is
that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the
next of kin to Major Fadi Bassem so that you will be
able to receive his funds.
WHAT IS TO BE DONE:
I want you to know that I have had everything planned
out so that we shall come out successful. I have
contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary
document that will back you up as the next of kin to
Major Fadi Bassem ,all that is required from you at
this stage is for you to
provide me with your Full Names and Address so that
the attorney can commence his job. After you have been
made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in
for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary
approval and letter of probate in your favor for the
move of the funds to an account that will be provided
by you.
There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we
are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney
will prepare all the necessary documents. Please
endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters
concerning this issue. Once the funds have been
transferred to your nominated bank account we shall
negotiate our sharing percentage and agreed on it.
Should you be interested please send me your full
names and current residential address and I will
prefers you to reach me on the email address below
(cheunghipu@primposta.com ) and finally after that
i shall provide you with more details of this
operation.
Your earliest response to this letter will be
appreciated.
Kind Regards
Mr. Cheung Pui
