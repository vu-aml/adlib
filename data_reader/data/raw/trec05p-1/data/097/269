Just to clarify,

PWRTESTN   points to GBLPARA  (which is a replicated database from GDB production).

PWRDEVN 	points to GBLTEST.

Tantra.

    After talking to our DBA Tantra, we found out that TESTN points to GBL PARA which
    is actually production global data.
    In that case we can not enter test global data in TESTN where we want to test.
    Tantra said that we can use DEVN for global test data, my impression is that we need 
    to use TESTN however

Sorry -- one more request.

I know a few of the Global users have tested this week.  Please provide me an update on the following. 

To all Global users:  If you have tested this week -- have you been sending your test scripts to your Unify users so they can verify the information has been replicated?  Also, give me an update if the scripts were run for Financial, Gas or Power.

To all Unify users:  If you have received test scripts (this week) have you verified the information was replicated?  If so, is it there?

If you are unaware what you are to be testing -- please let me know and I will send you the spreadsheet again.

Regards,
Melissa

These counterparties are not showing up in Enpower testn environment, which is where we are testing drivetrain.  I will enter test deals this morning under regular counterparty names in testn.

Please contact Elsie Lew, Vivien Pham or I to discuss testing between GCP and Unify. I will be in class on Tuesday morning and Thursday midday. Elsie Lew and Vivien Pham are assisting with testing the replication to Unify-Power. 

Thanks,

Rhonda

UAT (week of 10/22) is mandatory!  Please supply me with the times/dates you are available to test for the next two weeks, as well as the blackout times ASAP.

We are in the process of stress testing the system.  To ensure that we are free of errors and duplicate data -- I need new data to be entered into "ALL" scripts this week (preferably Monday thru Wednesday).   I know you are all extremely busy but the data entered prior to noon today cannot be used.  We have resolved a few issues and need new data sent across in order to verify the resolution is complete.

To prepare you in advance -- I will need you to re-run all test scripts again next week.

If you have question, concerns or run into any problems -- please call or email me immediately (x54889).  

Regards,
Melissa

DON'T FORGET:
Ensure that each team is communicating with each other.  The following process must be followed each and every time the test script is executed in order to track test script results:

The Result section of all test scripts must be filled out by the Global Users.  
Global users will email the completed test scripts to their Unify teammate.  
Once the Unify tester has completed verification, he/she will fill in the remainder of the Result information.  
After the Unify tester has verified and updated all test scripts, the Unify testers will forward the test scripts, along with all results to me.  

For example: When Marlene is finished entering all Global Facilities test scripts -> Chris, Wade and Richard should receive an email containing the test scripts and Result information needed for Unify verification (i.e. Pipeline, rate schedule, deal category, etc).  Richard, Wade and Chris will verify Unify information and fill in additional Result information.  Once that is complete -- I should receive 3 emails (one from each person) containing the test scripts and Result information.


Also, remember: you do not have to follow the scripts verbatim.  Under the Script Execution section of each script -- Required Actions are mandatory.  However, you can add additional information if you so choose.  The more information -- the better the test.  On the other hand, the Expected Results column may vary per user.  

NOTE:  The 18th floor testing lab is available for your use.  Please refer to the email I sent out for lab time availability.
