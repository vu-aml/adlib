Investment ideas

1. INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
Advent Software (ADVS)
What can you say about a tech stock that analysts tout even while estimates 
drop? How about: Nice!

By Marc Gerstein
   
Usually analysts like stocks when earnings are growing, and they are most 
bullish on shares of companies whose earnings growth is especially strong. 
That's a major reason why tech stocks have been in the doghouse lately. 
Earnings have been heading south. Whether or not you want to invest in tech 
now generally depends on how patient you are. If you're willing to get in early and 
wait until earnings recover and estimates get revised upward (something that will 
probably be occurring around mid-2002), this is a great time to jump in. If you're 
not so patient, you have to agonize trying to guess the timing of recovery.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
From Russia with love
A troika of telecom stocks that are well-positioned for current trends and gaining 
analyst esteem.

by Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist

When shares of Russian-based telecom companies start earning a measure of 
analyst esteem, savvy investors owe it to themselves to take a further look.

To be sure, these three Russian telcos haven't yet attained analysts' highest 
rating, but quite surprisingly--and seemingly out of nowhere--each has an 
average rating better than a neutral 3, and one of them has moved up to an 
average rating of 2 ("buy"). What gives?
