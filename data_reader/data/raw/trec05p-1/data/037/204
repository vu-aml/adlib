Dear Jeffrey:

Three key companies, led by three practiced and successful entrepreneurs, have been added to the roster for Internet Outlook's Private Equity Platform on September 10 and 11 at the San Francisco Airport Marriott. They've presented at Technologic Partners conferences in the past, and we're delighted they're participating once again. Specifically:

- Frank Moss, who took Tivoli Systems from a $50-million startup into a $743-million IBM acquisition, on the progress of Bowstreet's plans to take Web services from buzzword to profitable business model

- Steve Kirsch, founder of Mouse Systems and Infoseek, on how Propel is off to a fast start building scalable e-business applications

- Mike Homer, formerly of Apple, Netscape, and GO, and a board member at Palm and Tivo, on the recent launch of Kontiki, which aims to make the Web faster for us all

We reviewed over 400 companies delivering technologies and services that improve the functionality and ROI of corporate Web and data operations for this year's event. Assessing each company's market opportunity, momentum, and management plans, we whittled them down to the 100 or so we believe offer the best investment and alliance prospects out there today. Companies in such "hot" areas as Web services, Web site analysis/support, and Web performance are featured at this year's conference. To see a complete list of Private Equity Platform companies, visit: www.internetoutlook.net/docs/mmlist.asp <http://www.internetoutlook.net/docs/mmlist.asp>

Don't miss out on this opportunity to hear and see firsthand who is driving the online world and offering the best investment and partnership potential. Register today for Internet Outlook at: <https://secure.technologicpartners.com/IOregister.asp>

Only two weeks to go - I hope to see you there. It promises to be yet another great event.

All the best,
