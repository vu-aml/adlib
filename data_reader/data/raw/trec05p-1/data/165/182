I'm feeling better about the situation but still don't have the warm fuzzies.  Sounds as if we may be ok but I think planning should still run some numbers just in case.

Morris, 

Just wanted to give you an update on the electrical supply for the ENA/Hubbard Agreement.  I spoke with Bill Rapp and he informed me that at this point we can not negotiate a backup contract with Midland Power until ENA terminates their agreement.  Bill prepared a letter to send Midland Power covering the bankruptcy which Midland Power now has in their hands.  

I also spoke with Charlie Gramm and Mark Knippa.  Mark stated that ENA is in the process of getting the past due bills current and wish to continue providing electrical power for the compression.  Mark said this payment should happen in the next couple of days.  Mark did talk to Midland Power last week and explained the situation and felt confident that they would not shut off power.  Mark also stated that by contract that if ENA can not meet their obligations that gives NNG that right to purchase power directly from Midland Power.  Mark indicated at this point ENA wants to continue with the contract.

Charlie spoke with Midland Power today and was assured that they would not cut off power prior to Dec. 15th and being that the 15th was on a weekend that they would not shut off power over the weekend.  Charlie stated that the individual he talked with at Midland Power wanted to review some information that he had just received and that they would touch base later today or no later than in the morning.

To sum it all up we should have power to at least Monday and should have some additional information later today or early tomorrow on the long term solution.

I will keep you updated and let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks 

Jeff
