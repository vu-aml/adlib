   >>I walked into the grocery store not particularly interested in
   >>buying groceries.  I wasn't hungry.
   >>
   >>The pain of losing my husband of 37 years was still too raw.  And
   >>this grocery store held so many sweet memories.
   >>
   >>Rudy often came with me and almost every time he'd pretend to go
   >>off and look for something special.
   >>
   >>I knew what he was up to.  I'd always spot him walking down the
   >>aisle with the three yellow roses in his hands.  Rudy knew I loved
   yellow
   >>roses.  With a heart filled with grief, I only wanted to buy my few
   >>items and leave, but even grocery shopping was different since Rudy
   >>had  passed on.  Shopping for one took time, a little more thought
   than
   >>it
   >>had for two.
   >>
   >>Standing by the meat, I searched for the perfect small steak and
   >>remembered how Rudy had loved his steak.
   >>
   >>Suddenly a woman came beside me.  She was blond, slim and lovely in
   >>a soft green pantsuit.  I watched as she picked up a large pack of
   >>T-bones, dropped them  in her basket, hesitated, and then put them
   back.
   >>She
   >>turned to go and once again reached for the pack of steaks.
   >>
   >>She saw me watching her and she smiled.  "My husband loves T-bones,
   >>but honestly, at these prices, I don't know."
   >>I swallowed the emotion down my throat and met her pale blue eyes.
   >>"My  husband passed away eight days ago," I told her.  Glancing at
the
   >>package in her hands, I fought to control the tremble in my voice.
   >>"Buy him the steaks.  And cherish every moment you have together."
   >>
   >>She shook her head and I saw the emotion in her eyes as she placed
   >>the package in her basket and wheeled away.
   >>
   >>I turned and pushed my cart across the length of the store to the
   >>dairy products.  There I stood, trying to decide which size milk I
   should
   >>buy.  A quart, I finally decided and moved on to the ice cream
   >>section near the front of the store.  If nothing else, I could
   >>always fix myself an ice cream cone.  I placed the ice cream in my
   cart
   >>and looked down the aisle toward the front.
   >>
   >>I saw first the green suit, then recognized the pretty lady coming
   >>towards me.  In her arms she carried a package.
   >>On her face was the brightest smile I had ever seen.  I
   >>would swear a soft halo encircled her blond hair as she kept
   >>walking toward me, her eyes holding mine.  As she came closer, I saw
   what
   >>she held and tears began misting in my eyes.
   >>"These are for you," she said and placed three beautiful long
   >>stemmed yellow roses in my arms.  "When you go through the line, they
   >>will
   >>know these are paid for." She leaned over and placed a gentle kiss on
   my
   >>cheek, then
   >>smiled again.
   >>
   >>I wanted to tell her what she'd done, what the roses meant, but
   >>still unable to speak, I watched as she walked away as tears clouded
   my
   >>vision.  I looked down at the beautiful roses nestled in the green
   >>tissue wrapping and found it almost unreal.  How did she know?
   >>Suddenly  the answer seemed so clear.  I wasn't alone.
   >>"Oh, Rudy, you haven't forgotten me, have you?  I whispered, with
   >>tears in my eyes.  He was still with me, and she was his angel.
   >>
   >>Everyday be thankful for what you have and who you are.
   >>[Please read all of this, it is really nice]
   >>This is a simple request.  If you appreciate life, send this to
   >>your friends, including the person that sent it to you.
   >>
   >>Even though I clutch my blanket and growl when the alarm
   >>rings,thank you, Lord, that I can hear.
   >>There are many who are deaf.
   >>
   >>Even though I keep my eyes closed against the morning light as long
   >>as possible, thank you, Lord, that I can see.
   >>Many are blind.
   >>
   >>Even though I huddle in my bed and put off rising, thank you, Lord,
   >>that I have the strength to rise.
   >>There are many who are bedridden.
   >>
   >>Even though the first hour of my day is hectic, when socks are
   >>lost, toast is burned and tempers are short, my children are so loud,
   >>thank you, Lord, for my family.
   >>There are many who are lonely.
   >>
   >>Even though our breakfast table never looks like the pictures in
   >>magazines and the menu is at times unbalanced, thank you,Lord, for
   >>the food we have.
   >>There are many who are hungry.
   >>
   >>Even though the routine of my job often is monotonous,
   >>thank you, Lord, for the opportunity to work.
   >>There are many who have no job.
   >>
   >>Even though I grumble and bemoan my fate from day to day and wish
   >>my circumstances were not so modest, thank you, Lord, for life.
   >>
   >>Pass this on to the friends you know, it might help a bit to make
   >>this world a better place to live, right?
   >>PASS IT ON....
   >>A friend is someone we turn to when our spirits need a lift.
   >>A friend is someone to treasure.  For friendship is a gift.
   >>A friend is someone who fills our lives with Beauty, Joy and Grace
   >>And makes the world we live in a better and happier place.
   >>YOU ARE MY FRIEND AND I AM HONORED!
   >>
   >>Now send this to every friend you have.
   >>this was sent to me by a friend, and is now passed on to YOU, my
   >>friend
