ENERGY UPDATES

Deadline Extended for Higher Cool Roof Rebate Amount

In order to maximize opportunities to reduce electricity demand this year, the California Energy Commission (CEC) has extended the deadline for the higher Cool Roof rebate amount of 20¢ per square foot until October 31, 2001. After October 31st, rebates will be reduced to 15¢/sf. 

Over $21 million in financial incentives are being offered by the CEC for the installation of cool roofs on existing and new buildings. Eligible buildings include: local government, educational, commercial, and multi-family. New residential developments are also eligible; however, existing single-family homes are not.

By reflecting rather than absorbing solar energy, a cool roof reduces roof temperatures by 50 - 60 °F compared to a traditional 'hot' roof. As a result, a cool roof lowers a building's cooling energy requirements (by over 20%), increases the life-span of the roof, and reduces peak electricity demand. In addition, since the installed price of cool roofing materials is typically the same as non-reflective materials, the rebate makes cool roofs less expensive than traditional roofs.

The CEC has partnered with the non-profit Local Government Commission (LGC) to administer the cool roof incentives statewide. To learn more about the program, visit the LGC's web site at: www.lgc.org/techserve/coolroofs/. Or call the Cool Roof Hotline at 1.888.891.COOL(2665).


Neutrogena Invests in Solar Energy

Several communities and businesses are taking action now to
reduce carbon emissions, despite the United States government's recent rejection of the Kyoto Protocol on
Climate Change.  Neutrogena, a division of Johnson & Johnson, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) announced the completion of a 200-kilowat, $1.4 million solar power system at the company's headquarters in Los Angeles.  Neutrogena said a new solar system covering 24,000 square feet of roof area will help reduce the company's energy consumption by about 20 percent monthly.  According to Angelina Galiteva, LADWP director of strategic planning, the Neutrogena system will eliminate more than 513,000 pounds of carbon dioxide annually.

CHEMICAL AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS UPDATE 

U.S. Seeks To Stiffen Treaty on Germ War - Pact's Enforcement Mechanism Faulted 

President Bush continues to oppose a proposed enforcement mechanism for a treaty banning the development or stockpiling of biological weapons but is
pursuing an alternative with new urgency in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, administration officials said yesterday.

The administration began telling allies this spring that it would not support a proposal to prevent cheating on the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention,
which the United States ratified with 142 other nations. The administration said the verification proposal was fatally flawed, but said the United States
wanted to find other ways to strengthen the treaty and reduce the chance of germ warfare.

Administration officials said they plan to present their ideas at a biological weapons conference that begins Nov. 19 in Switzerland. Officials said the
administration plans to propose that nations pass stricter laws criminalizing the use and import or export of biological weapons, fund more research into
illnesses caused by biological weapons, and share information and expertise to minimize the effects if the weapons are used.

LOS ANGELES EVENTS WITH PRESIDENT GORBACHEV POSTPONED

Following President Gorbachev's decision to cancel his October trip to the U.S., Global Green USA has postponed the Sustainability Symposium and Green Cross Millennium Awards scheduled for October 13. Mikhail Gorbachev has committed to rescheduling his participation in both events so he can join with us in the celebration at a later time.  We 
will provide you with a tentative rescheduled date within the next week. 

In the meantime, our collective work must and will continue.  The efforts of 
Global Green USA to eliminate weapons of mass destruction and reduce 
environmental degradation -- a phenomenon that contributes to the root 
causes of terrorism, hatred, and fundamentalism -- find new purpose and 
meaning during this time.
