I made some cosmetic changes and added a one-paragraph summary up front, but otherwise we did not get any feed back so the comments are pretty much as they were circulated last week.  One thing, I could not delete the header on the first page that says that it is a draft, so Melinda/Donna, please have someone do that before it is filed.  Thanks, and I think this can be filed.  Due date is Monday.
