Hi, Kevin:

I hope you have returned to some pattern of normal operations in your shop,
given the events of last week.

Just a quick note to see if Ken Wicker from E-Source has contacted you
regarding coordination a session D (Renewables) of the Alternative Power
Track.  It appears that you're pretty busy with the Natural Gas
Infrastructure committee and I figured you wouldn't mind the relief.

Drop me a line and let me know whether or not Ken has contacted you when you
get a chance.  (FYI - Ken's number is 720-548-5735 and e-mail
kwicker@esource.com).

Thanks,

Bill Dulle
