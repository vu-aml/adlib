He can leave after six months now and not compete.  He would have 150 K if he signed the 300 doc.  Push him on this.

Fred has decided not to stay long-term. He will consider staying for 6 mo.s but it needs to be a "no brainer" - 250K up front/$250K at the end of the six months. I assume this wont work but let me know.
