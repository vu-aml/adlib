Hi Julie.

I've just sent out the confirmation and dialing instructions for tomorrow's call.    Dennis is aware that Danny can participate for a brief 15 min. and that Eric will cover.   Thanks for your response.   If Danny feels the need to touch base with Dennis separately, let me know and we'll find time.
