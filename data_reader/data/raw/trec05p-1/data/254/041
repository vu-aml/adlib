********** APOLOGIZE FOR MULTIPLE POSTING **************
********************************************************


The new interdisciplinary centre of excellence


Microsoft Research - University of Trento Centre for Computational and =
Systems Biology


has been established in the Trento region (Italy). The main objectives =
and activities of the centre are:


Overall objectives

 1. To advance the state of knowledge of biological information =
processing, the aetiology of disease, and potentially new therapies =
through the creation of a new research centre that will bring together =
scientists from multiple disciplines to focus on conducting leading =
research into advanced computational modeling of biological systems.

 2. To conduct novel research into defining new computational and =
communication paradigms that are 'biomimetic' in nature, i.e., based on =
new principles learned from the research into biological information =
processing.

 3. To exploit the research. This is expected to take the form of the =
development of new computational tools for enabling the predictive =
modeling of biological systems and processes for basic and applied =
research. These tools will help improving health-care, environment =
monitoring and protection, quality of food as well as developing better =
therapies and treatments by the pharmaceutical industries.

 4. To disseminate and communicate the results of this research for the =
benefit of the scientific community globally, including publications, =
open conferences and workshops, and provide freely available, the tools =
developed in the course of the research for (non-commercial) science.

Activities:

Calculi for Biology, and 'Biomimetic' computation

We attack an open and challenging problem: the definition of a set of =
basic and general primitives for modeling biological systems directly =
inspired by biological processes. Hence, the main objective of this =
theme is to define a calculus for biology and develop a prototype to be =
applied in the theme of case studies. We also plan to include =
quantitative information in the definition of the calculus.

It is our belief that biological phenomena can serve as valuable source =
of inspiration for new primitives of process calculi and new =
computational paradigms. Process calculi, by their own nature, take =
input and output, and hence communication, as the very basic form of =
action/reaction between concurrent systems.

Concurrency theory-and particularly process algebras-are emerging as a =
highly promising tool to provide formal foundations to systems biology. =
This field is evolving rapidly

Case studies

The main goal of this theme is to validate and tune the work of the =
previous theme by exploiting the results in software developing tools =
and helping biologists to do science. Furthermore, the preliminary =
analysis of real problems will inform the design of suitable primitives. =
Also, we will build upon the effort of the theme on calculi for the =
definition of analysis, verification and simulation techniques to =
acquire new knowledge on the biological realm. A different case study =
could inform how the languages and techniques devised here could be =
transposed into the ICT field to improve software quality and to manage =
complexity.

Storing dynamical evolution of biological systems

The main goal of this theme is to set-up the mining and access to =
distributed databases storing information (programs) on the dynamic =
behaviour of biological systems. Coordination with servers providing the =
run-time support for non-homogeneous data should also be provided. The =
knowledge and technology acquired in the first two research themes will =
be used to populate databases.


Detailed information on recruitment can be found at the page


http://www.unitn.it/events/microsoft/index_eng.htm


following the link recruitment.  The selection procedure will take place =
in the period 'end of May - mid June'.


More information on the centre will be available within few days on the =
web site.


Best regards,
