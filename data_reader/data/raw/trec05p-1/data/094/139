	Hello Bill,

	Your request is complete, effective upon refresh of the EnPower System. (refreshed nightly)

	Will,

	Would you check EnPower to assure that George Phillips is 'visible' in deal blotter
	this morning, Tuesday, 10/23/01??

	As usual, thanks Will.

	Best Rgds.

Samuel:

		We have a trader named George Phillips who needs to be mapped to the desks EPMI Hourly Ercot and EPMI Ercot Asset in deal blotter.  My blotter expert (Kroum Kroumov) tells me that Phillips should be mapped to those desks in CRD_PEOPLE_CD.  Are you the person who could take a look at this for me?  I would really appreciate it.
