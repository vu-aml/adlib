Calif. approves Calpine plant
The California Energy Commission on Monday
gave the final go-ahead for Calpine to begin con-struction
on its 600-MW, natural gas-fired Metcalf
Energy Center in San Jose, the company said.
The approval follows a two-and-a-half year
battle against local interests opposed to the proj-ect,
which will be located in power-hungry Silicon
Valley. Calpine is partnering with Bechtel Enter-prises
to build the plant.
The initial tide of local opposition was finally
turned by widespread support for the proposed
facility from state energy agencies, Gov. Gray Davis
and environmental groups. San Jose's city council
had initially refused to give zoning approval for the
facility but changed tack after the groundswell of
statewide support and the seriousness of the
state's energy shortage became apparent.
"We have always believed this is an ideal
location for a plant, in a region without its own
local source of significant power generation," Ken
Abreu, general manager for joint development for
the companies, said in a statement.
Calpine and Bechtel will begin construction
next month, with the start of commercial opera-tions
set for the second half of 2003.
