Categorizing Your Contact Records by Jeffrey Mayer 
When you have different categories of contacts, i.e. prospects, clients,
family & friends, and others, it's best to keep them in the same database.
This ensures that you will be able to find your contacts and that your
calendar and things to-do list will be current and up to date.

ACT!'s ID/Status field is designed to help you identify, or categorize,
each contact in your database. Always enter an ID/Status category. When you
need to find all your 'prospects' for example, just select Lookup,
ID/Status.

When you have a need for further categorization of your contacts, use
ACT!'s Groups feature. (Press F10 to open the Groups window.)
ACT!'s Group Rules feature enables you to automatically add contact records
to specific Groups based upon the information that is entered in selected
ACT! fields.

ACT!'s Group Rules feature can be found by selecting Group, Group
Membership, Define Rules from within the Groups window.

Tips" and Selling In Tough Times" please visit:

***********************************
Scheduling Recurring Activities by Jeffrey Mayer

When you have regularly scheduled business meetings, or outside activities,
use ACT!'s Recurring Activity feature to schedule those activities. This is
done by clicking the Recurring Setting tab in the Schedule Activity dialog
box.

If, for example, you were to have a regular meeting on the second & fourth
Tuesday of each month, you could schedule this meeting as a recurring
meeting. 

From the Recurring Settings tab, do the following:
1. Select Monthly as your frequency.
2.  Select Second and Fourth as the weeks you want this activity to
 repeat on.
3.  Select Tuesday as the day of the week.
4.  Click OK and ACT! schedules this meeting for the second and fourth
 Tuesday of the month.

Database to Database Synchronization by Douglas Wolf 

One of the challenges that face ACT! users is mobility. If you are a
salesperson working at an office and you would also like to be diligently
working at home in the evening or on weekends, you have to setup some sort
of synchronization process. The question is which process will work best to
accomplish the synchronization easily and reliably. If you have a laptop
computer that you can bring to the office and connect to the network or
directly to a desktop computer, the best way is database to database
synchronization. 

This version of synchronization works between two databases only. That
means you cannot sync database A with database B and database C. The
process is to sync between the laptop and the network before leaving for
home and then synch again when returning to the office. So, you have to
understand that you have 2 databases to keep up to date: the one on your
laptop computer and the office database.  There are quite a few steps
required in order to do this, so please click on the link below so you can
print out the entire article with step by step instructions.

Wolf, please visit:

Top Tricks for November by Real ACT! Users

Last month we asked you to send in your favorite ACT! tips and tricks. 
There were some great ones, and we’ve included a few here. We tested these
all and they worked for us. We hope you’ll give some of them a try.  And if
you have a tip or trick to share, let us know by sending your tip in e-mail
to comments@act.com.  These tips are in the writer’s original words and
have not been edited. Enjoy!

1. Clearing Many Alarms at Once by Rose D. in Seattle, WA

 “I tried this today and since it worked I thought I'd tell you.  We
 set alarms on our task listwhich contains dozens of call to make a
 day. The alarms pop up, sometimes 5-6-7 at a time.  Today, on the
 display of ringing alarms, I clicked "select all" and then "go to."
 A "Look Up" was created of the contacts with alarms ringing.  I then
 clicked "Clear Alarm" and the alarms on all these tasks were
 cleared. This saves a lot of steps.”

2. Looking Up Contacts Chronologically by Douglas B. in Miami, FL

 “I've found that the easiest way to look someone up is by their last 
 name(Alt LL). Have you ever tried to find a contact when you can't 
 recall their name? How about when you also can't remember which day 
 you met? Years ago I would log everyone I met into a notebook, so I 
 had a chronological list of the people I'd met. It's amazing, but
 ACT! does not allow you to create a chronological sort (sorting on
 the "create date" field is prohibited). Here's a useful workaround
 for this deficiency:

 1. Create a new field (mine is named "create date b") 
 2. Set the field as "required" and "date format", then make sure
  it is a tab stop. Every time you create a new record, you will
  be forced to enter the date in your new create date b field.
  This is a minor inconvenience when you consider that you will
  now be able to sort lookups by create date b. 
 3. Just tap F8, right click on the column label and tap "add
  columns to view" to add the new field to your list view. 
 4. Now tapping at the top of this column will sort your contacts
  by create date. 

This may improve your follow-up by allowing you to see your contacts in the
order they were created. It will also allow you to figure out the name of
"that guy you met last week".”

If you have your own ACT! Tricks for us to include next month, let us know
by e-mailing us at: mailto:comments@act.com

New ACT! Solution for HTML e-mail

We’ve talked about a few HTML e-mail packages for ACT! in previous
newsletters, and we’d like you to know about this one too. It’s called
FortuneFlow HTML, and it lets you send completely personalized HTML e-mail
to a single contact or thousands - from your ACT! database.

Create your standard letterhead template with any HTML Editor, and
FortuneFlow HTML Edition will spell check your message, merge it into your
template, and send it to your ACT! Lookup.

We’ve tested it, and it works like a charm.  It’s not a service like some
others so you can just buy the software and send as many HTML e-mails as
you want without additional fees.
