Hey Eric,

Christ almighty, u still got a job?  I bought into Enron at $38 or so..... 
now they're at 0.61.  I really know how to pick'em.  I lost about 1,300 on 
ENE.  I should get to watch the game this saturday and am pretty pumped 
about it.

What all events would have to occur for us to get a Rose Bowl slot?

Yeah, I'm still in HI for another year to year and a half.  I'm going to 
Telluride with Marilyn from 22 Dec to 27 Dec to do the whole proposal thing 
then I leave Hou on the 2nd of Jan.  So if ur in town from 27 dec to 02 jan 
lemme know.
