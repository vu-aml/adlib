NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Correll Buckhalter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01
Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's game against Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.

Jamal Lewis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=187391&>, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01
According to published reports, Lewis has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or rehabi! li! tate with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/16/01
Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.

Frank Wycheck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/16/01
According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a Fantasy p! er! spective. 

Steve McNair <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01
Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Fri! da! y's practice that Smith would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.

Frank Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit. However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play. 

Chris Weinke <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=235174&>, QB CAR! -! Tori Updated 11/16/01
According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 11/16/01
Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Cris Carter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 11/16/01Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night. 

Randy Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/16/01
Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers. 

Ricky Williams <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=133448&>, RB NO - Bass/Hull! Updated 11/16/01
Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start. 

Aaron Brooks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=133233&>, QB NO - Matty Updated 11/16/01
Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense. 

Willie Jackson!  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1234&>, WR NO - Martin Updated 11/16/01
Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option. 

Stephen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01
Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games. 

Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is ! wo! rth considering. 

Rod Gardner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move. 

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=12411&>, WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 11/16/01
Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of de! ep! er leagues. 

Torry Holt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=133310&>, WR STL - Tori Updated 11/16/01
Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 11/16/01
Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still wo! rt! h starting based on his potential for big numbers. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 11/16/01
Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England. 

Ernie Conwell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1366&>, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do. 

Richard Huntley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1456&>, RB CAR - Russell Updated 11/16/01
Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible. 

Donald Hayes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01
Hayes ha! d ! only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble. 

Wesley Walls <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01
Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move. 

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01
Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week. 

Bubba Franks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers! , ! but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01
Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.
