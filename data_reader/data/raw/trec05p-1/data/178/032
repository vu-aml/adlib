<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=1321&"><B>Wesley Walls</B></A>, TE CAR - The Snake Pit <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=133297&"><B>Martin Gramatica</B></A>, K TB - One Man Show <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Gramatica injured his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. He hurt himself on a PAT attempt, but Gramatica is expected to play on December 29.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=1871&"><B>Todd Bouman</B></A>, QB MIN - Meximullets <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game.

Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=1663&"><B>Antowain Smith</B></A>, RB NE - The Guzzlers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.   </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=1069&"><B>Steve McNair</B></A>
, QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhackers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=146325&"><B>Jeff Garcia</B></A>, QB SF - The Guzzlers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

Fred Beasley</B></A>, RB SF - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=1511&"><B>Joe Horn</B></A>, WR NO - The Lie Downs <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=188183&"><B>Maurice Smith</B></A>, RB ATL - Who's Yo Daddy <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=12431&"><B>Donald Hayes</B></A>, WR CAR - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=235174&"><B>Chris Weinke</B></A>, QB CAR - The Lie Downs <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=12797&"><B>Kurt Warner</B></A>, QB STL - Who's Yo Daddy <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=1034&"><B>Rich Gannon</B></A>, QB OAK - The Executioners <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched. </FONT>
</FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=12576&"><B>Randy Moss</B></A>, WR MIN - Meximullets <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=235122&"><B>Marvin Minnis</B></A>, WR KC - North Blvd Nutwhackers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=1310&"><B>Michael Westbrook</B></A>
, WR WAS - The Snake Pit <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=235213&"><B>Rod Gardner</B></A>, WR WAS - Not So Nice Machine <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=1471&"><B>Tony Richardson</B></A>, RB KC - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=12400&"><B>Tony Gonzalez</B></A>, TE KC - The Executioners <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=1028&"><B>Brett Favre</B></A>, QB GB - The Fat Bastards <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Favre has been one of the best QBs this season.
