>
>SUBJECT:  Slow Dance
>
>This poem was written by a terminally ill young girl in a New York
>Hospital.
>
>It was sent by a medical doctor-Make sure to read what is in the
>closing statement AFTER THE POEM.
>
>Have you ever watched kids on a merry-go-round? Or listened to the rain
>slapping on the ground? Ever followed a butterfly's erratic flight? Or
>gazed at the sun into the fading night?
>You better slow down. Don't dance so fast. Time is short. The music
>won't last. Do you run through each day off the fly? When you ask how
>are you? Do you hear a reply?
>When the day is done do you lie in your bed with the next hundred
>chores running through your head? You'd better slow down, don't dance
>so fast. Time is short. The music won't last.
>Ever told your child, we'll do it tomorrow? And in your haste, not see
>his sorrow?
>Ever lost touch, let a good friendship die, cause you never had time  to
>call and say hi?  You'd better slow down. Don't dance so fast. Time is
>short. The music won't last.
>When you run so fast to get somewhere, you miss half the fun of
>getting  there. When you worry and hurry through your day, It is like an
>unopened gift....Thrown away.
>Life is not a race. Do take it slower, Hear the music before the song
>is over.
>
>PLEASE FORWARD THIS TO HELP THIS LITTLE GIRL. ALL FORWARDED E-MAILS
>ARE  TRACKED TO OBTAIN THE TOTAL COUNT.
>
>PLEASE pass this mail onto everybody you know. It is an request of a
>special little girl who will soon leave this world as she has cancer.
>Thank you for your effort, this isn't a chain letter, but a choice for
>all of us to save a little girl that's dying of a serious and fatal
>form of cancer.
>Please send this to everyone you know or don't know. This little girl
>has 6 months left to live, and as her dying wish, she wanted to send a
>letter telling everyone to live their life to the fullest, since she
>never will. She will never make it to prom, graduate from high school,
>or get married and have a family of her own.
>
>By you sending this to as many people as possible, you can give her
>and her family a little hope, because with every name that is sent to, The
>American Cancer Society will donate 3 cents per name to her treatment
>and recovery plan.
>
>It's not even your money, just your time! PLEASE PASS ON A LAST
>REQUEST
