real quick weekend update --

scheduled volumes dropped to the 1400 level.

this worked well with our major mainline outage upstream of station 18 -- job to be completed by this evening.

ingliss lateral / gru outage -- hydrostatic test going as planned -- still coordinating with gru to schedule last section.

saturday's 25 hour gas day was a challenging gas day for us -- started with 4900 finished with 4550 -- we were targeting 4600 for these lower deliveries.

currently at 4600 total linepack -- 1400 schedule -- we are in very good position to start the week.
