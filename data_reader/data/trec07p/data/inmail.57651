Lou Dobbs Tonight
Thursday June 14, 2007

Tonight, a government supported by Iran and Syria has taken
over Gaza, a major setback for the United States in terms of
Middle East policy. We’ll have the latest on the Palestinian
battle and what this means for the region.

Dangerous Imports: More recalls today on dangerous imports from
China that are putting Americans and their children at risk.
The Consumer Product Safety Commission recalled 1.5 million toy
trains, including Thomas the Tank Engine, because they are
painted with toxic lead. Colgate – Palmolive is recalling
toothpaste sold in some Northeast discount stores because the
products are counterfeit and contain a poisonous chemical found
in antifreeze. More on this shocking report tonight.

The California Republican Party has decided there are no
Americans to run their campaigns. The California GOP just hired
a Canadian citizen, Christopher Matthews, as its Deputy
Political Director. Matthews will be working in the United
States on a renewable one-year H1-B visa. We'll bring you the
full report tonight.	

The Department of Transportation is pressing ahead with its
Mexican cross-border trucking program, but not without backlash
from groups who say they are disregarding safety regulations
outlined in legislation signed by President Bush. Many groups
are concerned the program opens America’s borders up to major
safety concerns and possibly terrorism. Will it? We’ll discuss
that story tonight.

Disregard for immigration laws is becoming increasingly
official in local communities.	The Mayor of New Haven, John
DeStefano, exposed plans for an ICE raid in his city to protect
the illegal aliens living there from deportation. In addition,
the Mayor is issuing ID cards to illegal aliens. Tune in
tonight for more on official disregard for federal policy.

And a debate on God & Politics: We'll have a spirited
discussion on the debate over politics and religious in this
country with Alan Dershowitz, author of "Blasphemy: How the
Religious Right is Hijacking the Declaration of Independence"
and Tony Perkins, President of the Family Research Council.

Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lou’s
latest commentary on why the President should just give it a
rest when it comes to the co-called comprehensive immigration
reform bill.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
