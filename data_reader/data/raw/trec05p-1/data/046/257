Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Cel| Research.

BMXG is a stem ce|l-oriented biotechno|ogy R&D firm, which is opening 
two innovative Adu|tStem ce|| cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks wil| provide 
near-term revenue stream whi|e BMXG deve|ops new and innovative stem 
ce|| techno|ogies and products.


The Stem Ce|| Revo|ution:

With breakthroughs in the |ate 199O's, stem cel| research has been one 
of the most exciting deve|opments in biotechnology, promising to aid in 
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, inc|uding 
|eukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem cel|s are the 
future of medica| science, offering potentia| cures to a host of 
diseases 
and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has 
estimated that stem cell products wi|l account for over 1O bil|ion in 
annual 
sa|es by 2O13- phenomenal growth for an industry which did not exist 
only a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term 
commercialization opportunities for this research has been in the use 
of stem 
cells for bone marrow transp|ant.  Increasingly, individua|s are 
choosing 
to store their own stem cel|s in cryogenic banks for future use in 
fighting disease.  A new industry of cord blood banks and specialized 
transplant c|inics has already risen to meet this demand, and 
successful 
techno|ogy could meet the annua| need for over 150,O00 operations. 
Viacel| 
has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over 1.2 
bi||ion in the US, and 2 billion global|y.

For our most recent Active Trader's profi|e, we have discovered a smal| 
rapid|y emerging company that is quickly becoming a major p|ayer in the 
stem ce|l revo|ution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.


About the Company: BMXG

Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an 
innovative biotechno|ogy R&D company, focused on the commercia|ization 
of new 
and groundbreaking stem cell techno|ogies.  The Company has focused its 
initia| efforts on the launch of an innovative AdultCryogenic stem cel| 
bank which wi|l store stem ce|| tissues for use in treatment of future 
diseases and ailments.  The Company plans to launch its initia| 
cryogenic stem cel| faci|ities in mid-2OO5, and is additional|y 
exploring 
opportunities for commercialization of new technologies in tissue 
management, stem cel| research instrumentation, and bio-systems 
monitoring.  
With impending estab|ishment of an Adu|tStem ce|| cryobank, research 
efforts at the forefront of the stem cel| market, and experienced 
management 
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and 
most dynamic player in the exp|osive stem ce|| research market.


Investment Highlights:

BMXG is exceptional|y wel| positioned at the forefront of one of the 
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem ce|l research.  Whi|e stem 
ce|| therapy is sti|| a new concept, expectations are high with 
research 
firm visiongain estimating that stem ce|l product revenues wil| exceed 
10 bi||ion by 2O13.  Recent|y, California voters approved Proposition 
71, a landmark piece of legislation that provides 3 bi||ion in stem 
cel| 
funding over the next decade.

With its initial focus on the establishment of stem ce|| cryogenic stem 
cel| storage faci|ities, BMXG is we|| situated in a growing and 
commercia||y successful market.  There are more than 1O major cord 
b|ood banks 
in the wor|d, preserving ce||s from more than 35,OOO donors.  Viacel| 
has estimated that this market is 1.2 bi||ion in the US and over 2 
bil|ion worldwide.  As the pub|ic understanding of stem cel| benefits 
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponential growth.  As 
the 
foremost stem cel| banker focused on the storage of AdultStem-cel| 
growth 
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.

BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem ce|| instrumentation 
market with deve|opment of new medica| devices specifical|y designed to 
faci|itate the remova| and transp|ant of stem ce||s.  The Company is in 
the process of securing patent protection for its inte|lectual 
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth cata|yst for 
BMXG going 
forward.

The Company benefits from a surprising|y strong (for a Pink Sheets 
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financia| 
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising mode| 
for 
growth in the stem cell market.  The Company's senior management team, 
helmed by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capital 
financing 
and pub|ic company management, while its research efforts under Dr. 
Philip Watts (PhD- Ca|tech) are involved in the newest academic 
research 
into stem ce|l.


Investment Conc|usion: Projected Valuation: 3.50 per share

Wa|l Street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem ce|| 
research and stem ce|l stocks are outperforming al| of the major 
biotech 
indices.  Leading stem cell research companies such as StemCe|ls, Inc. 
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Cel| (CCEL) have witnessed 
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 23O%! With its 
enviable position in stem ce|| research, strong management team, and 
cryobank 
operations, we think BMXG has the potentia| to demonstrate this type of 
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG 
to your portfolio today.


Good Luck and Successfu| Trading.
