TONIGHT ON THE CBS EVENING NEWS
<http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/eveningnews/main3420.shtml>=20

Here is an early preview of what Awe are planning for tonight's CBS
EVENING NEWS from Anchor and Managing Editor, Katie Couric...=20

Hi everyone,=20

Today, the investigation continues into the tragedy at Virginia Tech
and, of course, our correspondents are on the scene covering every
angle.=20

A picture of Cho Seung-Hui is slowly emerging: he was a solitary young
man with few friends. But his bizarre behavior had been noticed - two
women at Virginia Tech say they raised concerns in 2005 about Cho's
repeated attempts to contact them. When can a school take steps against
a student it suspects might someday cause harm? Cynthia Bowers will have
the details.=20

The paper trail Cho left behind helps fill in the picture. Sharyn
Alfonsi will report on Cho's alarming creative writing pieces, the
ranting note he left behind and the latest on the investigation into
Monday's massacre.=20

A significant part of that investigation hinges on forensic evidence,
and some of that is locked inside the computer Cho owned and used.
Technology correspondent Daniel Sieberg will report on how authorities
are extracting information from the gunman's hard drive.=20

Also, Thalia Assuras will have an emotional interview with a young woman
who lives near the site of the first shooting Monday. It's a dramatic
account.=20

In other news, the Supreme Court upheld the country's ban on certain
abortions this morning. The justices ruled 5-4 that the Partial Birth
Abortion Ban Act that Congress passed and President Bush signed four
yeas ago is constitutionally sound. Wyatt Andrews will have more on the
decision. Our chief legal analyst, Andrew Cohen, will also weigh in on
the implications of the decision.=20

Finally, it has been an extraordinarily deadly day in Baghdad, where
more than 175 people were killed in a series of bombings - the worst day
of violence since the American troop surge began a few months ago.
Martin Seemungal will report.=20

I hope you'll join us.=20

TONIGHT ON DAVID LETTERMAN <http://www.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/>=20

Join Dave tonight on The Late Show with actress Edie Falco AND comedian
Paul Scheer... Plus, musical guests Son Volt!=20

________________________________


THURSDAY MORNING ON THE EARLY SHOW
<http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/earlyshow/main500202.shtml>=20

Harry Smith and Kelly Wallace will anchor THE EARLY SHOW from
Blacksburg, VA. Russ Mitchell anchors from New York. Dave Price will
bring us the weather. Hannah Storm and Julie Chen are off.=20

We will continue to cover the "MASSACRE AT VIRGINIA TECH".=20

We will have the latest on the allegations that Cho Seung-Hui had
engaged in stalking behavior, reaction from students, and how the
injured are recovering. Including:=20

STUDENT REACTION: Shot in the massacre, Garrett Evans may never be the
same. That is because doctors have made the decision to leave the bullet
in his injured leg. How is Garrett coping through the pain? We'll speak
with him Wednesday morning.=20

STUDENT REACTION CONTINUES: We'll speak with a fellow English major who
was enrolled in the same playwriting class as Cho. What were the signs
in Cho's writing? We'll find out Wednesday morning.=20

COLUMBINE ANNIVERSARY: School shootings are nothing new. As we approach
the anniversary of Columbine, we'll speak with a parent who knows all
too well what it is like to lose a child in such a horrific tragedy. Tom
Mauser will join us.=20

  Anchor and Managing Editor, Katie Couric&#8230;</span></font></b></strong=
> <br>
  <br>
  Hi everyone, <br>
  <br>
  Today, the investigation continues into the tragedy at Virginia Tech and,=
 of
  course, our correspondents are on the scene covering every angle. <br>
  <br>
  A picture of Cho Seung-Hui is slowly emerging: he was a solitary young man
  with few friends. But his bizarre behavior had been noticed &#8211; two w=
omen
  at Virginia Tech say they raised concerns in 2005 about Cho&#8217;s repea=
ted
  attempts to contact them. When can a school take steps against a student =
it
  suspects might someday cause harm? <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Cy=
nthia
  Bowers</span></b> will have the details. <br>
  <br>
  The paper trail Cho left behind helps fill in the picture. <b><span
  style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Sharyn Alfonsi</span></b> will report on Cho&#=
8217;s
  alarming creative writing pieces, the ranting note he left behind and the
  latest on the investigation into Monday&#8217;s massacre. <br>
  <br>
  A significant part of that investigation hinges on forensic evidence, and
  some of that is locked inside the computer Cho owned and used. Technology=
 correspondent
  <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Daniel Sieberg</span></b> will report=
 on
  how authorities are extracting information from the gunman&#8217;s hard
  drive. <br>
  <br>
  Also, <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Thalia Assuras</span></b> will =
have
  an emotional interview with a young woman who lives near the site of the
  first shooting Monday. It&#8217;s a dramatic account. <br>
  <br>
  In other news, the Supreme Court upheld the country&#8217;s ban on certain
  abortions this morning. The justices ruled 5-4 that the Partial Birth
  Abortion Ban Act that Congress passed and President Bush signed four yeas=
 ago
  is constitutionally sound. <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Wyatt Andr=
ews</span></b>
  will have more on the decision. Our chief legal analyst, <b><span
  style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Andrew Cohen</span></b>, will also weigh in on=
 the
  implications of the decision. <br>
  <br>
  Finally, it has been an extraordinarily deadly day in <st1:City w:st=3D"o=
n"><st1:place
   w:st=3D"on">Baghdad</st1:place></st1:City>, where more than 175 people w=
ere
  killed in a series of bombings &#8211; the worst day of violence since the
  American troop surge began a few months ago. <b><span style=3D'font-weigh=
