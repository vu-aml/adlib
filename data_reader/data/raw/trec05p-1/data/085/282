Another big relief job from Jason White and another smothering performance by the Oklahoma defense. That's the combination punch the Sooners used to beat Kansas, and run the nation's longest winning streak to 19 straight. Of course, Sooners Illustrated was on location, bringing its readers every exciting detail, from kickoff to the final gun. All of the emotion, each bone-crushing hit, and every subtle detail can be found inside SI's pages, including features, views from inside the huddle and the behind-the-scenes scoop.

Sooners Illustrated delivers the most comprehensive coverage of Oklahoma athletics you'll find anywhere, especially when it comes to football. Sooner Magic is as close as your fingertips with every action-packed issue of SI.

Here's a glimpse of what in the latest edition of SI:
