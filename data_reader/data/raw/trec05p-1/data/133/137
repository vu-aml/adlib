Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=2762&key=1372&"><B>Frank Wycheck</B></A>, TE TEN - Matty <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati.

He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=2762&key=1094&"><B>Emmitt Smith</B></A>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=2762&key=1184&"><B>Frank Sanders</B></A>, WR ARI - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A !

However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=2762&key=133263&"><B>Daunte Culpepper</B></A>, QB MIN - Giggles <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=2762&key=12576&"><B>Randy Moss</B></A>, WR MIN - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy number!

He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.   </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=2762&key=133233&"><B>Aaron Brooks</B></A>, QB NO - Matty <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=2762&key=1234&"><B>Willie Jackson</B></A>, WR NO - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=2762&key=1440&"><B>Stephen Davis</B></A>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull <FONT SIZE=1>Updated !

/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player.

He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his potential for big numbers. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=2762&key=1109&"><B>Marshall Faulk</B></A>, RB STL - Matty <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league.

With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=2762&key=1456&"><B>Richard Huntley</B></A>, RB CAR - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings.
