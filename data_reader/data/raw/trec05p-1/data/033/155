Following up on our previous conversation regarding fundraisers, we need to
schedule a dinner with the Latino Caucus and the African American Caucus in
connection with Enron's contributions.  The dinners need to be between now
and the end of session, though the final week is hectic.  We could also try
to schedule a lunch if necessary but dinner is preferable.  We need at least
one person from Enron, in addition to Hedy, Bev and I, at these events.

Please advise.
