Dear Haas Community,

Please find below a State Department Fact Sheet on Chemical and Biological 
agents. In light of yesterday's event at Haas I thought it might be useful 
for you to have this information. Please note the intended audience is 
Americans living overseas.

Sebastian

==============================


U.S. Department of State
Washington, D.C.

FACT SHEET
CHEMICAL - BIOLOGICAL AGENTS

The recent terrorist threats and confirmed cases of exposure to anthrax have
caused an increase in anxiety over the possibility of chemical and
biological attacks (CBA). Currently, the method of delivery of anthrax has
been by letter or package. While the risk of such attacks is limited, it
cannot be excluded. As always, the Department will promptly share with
American citizens overseas any credible information about threats to their
safety. Americans should stay informed and be prepared for any eventuality.


In 1999, the Department of Defense announced its intention to commence the
Family and Force Protection Initiative (FFPI) in order to provide enhanced
protection to the dependents of U.S. military service members and to
civilian Department of Defense (DOD) employees and their families. This
program was first implemented for U.S. Forces Korea.

The Department of State has had a chemical and biological countermeasure
program since 1998, when it began to deploy chemical antidotes and
antibiotics to selected posts abroad. While we have no information to
indicate there is an imminent threat from use of anthrax or other biological
agents as a weapon against our overseas missions at this time, the
Department is expanding its countermeasure program. As a precaution, the
Department requested our missions overseas to stock a three-day supply of
the antibiotic ciprofloxacin for all individuals who work in or frequent the
missions.

This small supply of ciprofloxacin is being pre-positioned to ensure rapid
access to this protective antibiotic for our employees in case of an Anthrax
exposure in an overseas USG facility and would allow the mission sufficient
time to provide access to care for all individuals exposed while securing
additional supplies of antibiotics. Once an exposure is suspected, all
individuals who had been exposed in our workplace would be provided
antibiotics pending a full investigation of the exposure. This would include
any private American citizen present in the facility at the time of
exposure.

Again, if the Department becomes aware of any specific and credible threat
to the safety and security of American citizens abroad, that information
will be provided to them promptly.

Exposures to CBA that occur outside USG facilities would require the
involvement of local public health authorities who would provide information
and if necessary, protective antibiotics to the general public.
Ciprofloxacin and other antibiotics effective against Anthrax, including
doxycycline and amoxicillin are available with a prescription in most
pharmacies throughout the world.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the lead government
agency on infectious diseases, including chemical/biological agents (CBA).
For detailed information on CBA, including Anthrax, inquirers are referred
to the CDC Internet home page at http://www.cdc.gov. The CDC's international
travelers hotline telephone number is 1-877-FYI-TRIP (1-877-394-8747);
fax: 1-888-CDC-FAXX (1-888-232-3299).

As always, American citizens should review their own personal security
situations and take those precautions they deem appropriate to ensure their
well-being.

Some general information on chemical-biological agents (CBA) follows:

A. Biological agents can be dispersed by an aerosol spray that must be
inhaled. However, these agents can also be used to contaminate food, water
and other products. Attention to basic food hygiene when traveling abroad is
very important.

A. Some chemical agents may be volatile--evaporating rapidly to form
clouds of agent. Others may be persistent. These agents may act directly on
the skin, lungs, eyes, respiratory tract or be absorbed through your skin
and lungs causing injury. Choking and nerve agents damage the soft tissue
in these organs.

A. When properly used, appropriate masks are effective protection to
prevent the inhalation of either biological or chemical agents; however this
assumes an adequate warning. Gas masks alone do not protect against agents
that act through skin absorption. Those who wish to acquire protective
equipment for personal use should contact commercial vendors.

A. There is an incubation period after exposure to biological agents.
It is essential that you seek appropriate care for illnesses acquired while
traveling abroad to assure prompt diagnosis and treatment.

A. One of the biological warfare agents is the spore-forming bacterium
that causes Anthrax, an acute infectious disease. It should be noted,
however, that effective dispersal of the Anthrax bacteria is difficult.

* Anthrax is treatable if that treatment is initiated promptly after
exposure. The post-exposure treatment consists of certain antibiotics
administered in combination with the vaccine.

* An anthrax vaccine that confers protective immunity does exist, but
is not readily available to private parties. Efficacy and safety of use of
this vaccine for persons under 18 or over 65 and pregnant women have not
been determined.
*
* The anthrax vaccine is produced exclusively by Bioport under
contract to the Department of Defense. Virtually all vaccine produced in
the United States is under Defense Department contract primarily for
military use and a small number of other official government uses.

* For additional information, please consult your health care provider
or local health authority.
