Cara,
Here is a list of updates:

Asem, Vish:
Please look this over to verify that I haven't missed anything.

Aug 14:
Pre-Schedule Workspace:
When double click a cell automatically go to the "Editor" edit box.
Allow show / hide of Editor.  Add to menu under View / Toolbars as well as popup menu.
Move copy from Workspace to File in the menu.
Add an icon for copy.  
Rename "Excel Utilities" to "Spreadsheet Utilities" on the toolbar as well as the View menu.
Contains also fix for looking up correct location for summary report.

Path Confirmation:
Now in West Regions you can see Northwest which is R9
Closing the path cut is fast now
Annuity Id in path cuts can accept non numeric values (strings also)
Cut Hour is in 0000-2400 format
Added validation on Resupply deal#, it should be valid existing Enpower deal 


Aug 3:
Pre-Schedule:	
Dumps summary report to excel
Edit box shown for looking at cells with large values

	Outstanding issues:
What to do with records with  'WEEK' specified in SCHED_TERM field for there is no 'WEEK' section in the physicalandbookoutsummary excel report file.  I have fired off an email to Cara asking for assistance on this matter.

	Notes:
The application will look in the follow places for the PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54.xls file if user launching app has no existing profile in pwr_user_default_settings (fSUMMARYLOCATION) 
		i.e. User is WEST trader and in following DB environments:
			pwrstage[n/p]:	M:\Electric\Schedule\Process\WEST\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v254WestTest.xls
			pwrprod:	O:\Portland\WestDesk\SCHEDULING\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v254WestProd.xls
A pre-existing excel report must exist in location for appending to occur

Path Confirmations Report
Fixed, Press Enter or Select the date from the drop down Pulling up the proper date with the calendar is slow when there is data populated into the system. We need to make sure that the selection process does not get incrementally slower with each additional day of data that is added.
Log Text displays in clean format
POR/POD can be easy to pick up

	Path Cuts
Fixed  Need to filter Region list for cuts by trading desk (East or West).
Fixed Allow hour ranges in the Hour # field specifically in HE 0000 (military) format (e.g.  0200-0400 or 1000-1400).
Fixed In the cut view, the region is still the cumbersome drop down list. This needs to be a forced choice option, like the hour-ahead vs. real-time selection.  The choices for the west are : WSCC-S, WSCC-N, Rockies, Northwest, California. Corry will be able to provide his region choices.
Provided an option to easily create a new path cut by selecting Copy Path Cut button and change the values needed
Taking care of validation while cutting the hour



Regards,
Will
