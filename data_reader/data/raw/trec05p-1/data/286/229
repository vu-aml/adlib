You have been identified as a current subscriber to our Reuter's Cobra or I-Finance Market Data. We are currently in the process of re-negotiating these licenses. Please respond no later than Tuesday, May 28th with your Co# and RC. Future ongoing services will be allocated to the appropriate cost centers. 
This information will allow us to negotiate in an informed manner. Individual costs will be determined at the time we have gathered all subscriber details. 

I appreciate your assistance with this effort.
