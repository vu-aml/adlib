Details are still rough and the situation is very fluid, but here is what is currently going on:

Senators Hertzberg and Keeley are amending both SB 78XX and AB 82XX.  Upon an initial read, it appears that they are doing the following:
AB 82XX has been gutted except for the direct access provisions and the renewables portfolio.  (The core/non-core business provisions, the transmission asset purchase, etc. all appear to have been deleted.)  Both of these provisions that have been left in the bill were seen as positive by members last week when the bill was first debated. 
It appears amendments have been made to SB 78XX but the extent of these changes are not yet known.  
At the beginning of both amended bills, it states, "As proposed to be amended into SB_XX."   This means that amendments to SB 78 could be incorporated into AB 82, and vice versa.  Another possibility is an entirely new bill.
