Please take note of my previous e-mail on Ramirez's meeting. We may have to change the date of the potencial meeting with Ramirez to maybe Wed. or Thursday or depending on the time of the Governors meeting on Tuesday (although it seems to close).

Emilio,
Chavez is going to Anzoategui tomorrow and tomorrow's agenda was moved to Thursday, and therefor our meeting could not be confirmed. I got a firm appointment for next Tuesday at 4:00 p.m. Regards,
ALF
