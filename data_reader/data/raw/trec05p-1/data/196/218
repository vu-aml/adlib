Sally -

I have 2 questions from the list that you provided this evening.

1.  Daren Farmer is on the list for Gas Logistics.  Jeanie advised that Daren resigned and his last day is Friday.  Need a replacement.

2.  Israel Estrada is on the list for Documentation, however, he is no longer showing in our database.  Do we need to add back?

Thanks again!
Amy
