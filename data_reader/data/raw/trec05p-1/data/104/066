2. Jim Steffes - %40
	My primary role for Jim is to provide Updates on all GA activity on a monthly, or available on request.
		A) Monthly ENA/EES/GA reports
		B) Develop and update new project tracking program for all of GA (This is currently my most timely project, as we would like to have it in place by the 			beginning of November.)
		C) Serve on an "as needed basis" when certain situations arise.

3. Rob Bradley -%10

Amr - I will primarily be focused on updating the Project Tracking database in the next few days, as well as compiling Jim's monthly report.  My goal is to have this completed by the end of Tuesday, and to resume work on ISO/and Philippine projects on Wednesday.

Thanks,
Bryan
