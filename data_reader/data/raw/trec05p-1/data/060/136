Three blondes died in an accident trying to jump the Grand Canyon. They
are
  at the pearly gates of Heaven. St. Peter tells them that they can enter
the
  gates only if they can answer one simple religious question.

 The question posed by St. Peter is - "What is Easter"?

 The first blonde replies, "Oh, that's easy! It's the holiday in November
  when we all get together, eat turkey and are thankful."

 "Wrong!, you are not welcome here, I'm afraid. You must go to the other
  place!" replies St. Peter. Then he turns to the second blonde, and asks
her
  the same question - "What is Easter?"

 The second blonde replies, "Easter is the holiday in December when we put
  up a nice tree, exchange presents, and celebrate the birth of Jesus."

 St. Peter looks at the second blonde, bangs his head on the pearly Gates
  in disgust and tells her she's wrong and will have to join her friend in
  the other place; she is not welcome in Heaven.

 He then peers over his glasses at the third blonde and asks, "Do YOU know
  what Easter is?"

 The third blonde smiles confidently and looks St. Peter in the eyes, "I
  know what Easter is."

 "Oh?" says St. Peter, incredulously.

 "Easter is the Christian holiday that coincides with the Jewish
celebration
  of Passover. Jesus and his disciples were eating at the last supper and
  Jesus was later deceived and turned over to the Romans by one  of his
  disciples. The Romans took him to be crucified and he was stabbed in the
  side, made to wear a crown of thorns, and was hung on a cross with  nails
  through his hands and feet. He was buried in a nearby cave which was
sealed
  off by a large boulder."

 St. Peter smiles broadly with delight.

 Then the third blonde continues ... "Every year the boulder is moved aside
  so that Jesus can come out and, if he sees his shadow, there will be six
  more weeks of winter!
