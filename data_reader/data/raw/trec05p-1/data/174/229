Brad - I could not agree with you more.  We do not want to negotiate this in the public arena. I felt the stories in the Calgary Herald, National Post were unfortunate in timing and substance. 

 As per your suggestion I have eliminated the last 2 bullets and attached the talking points here.  The last bullet in the revised talking points was devised to take media pressure off of both us and the Producers.  There has been an incredible amount of political hay being made with this project and it has realized an inordinate amount of media attention.  We need to give the media (only if asked or questioned - not to be released) some reasonable expectations for time frames.  In any discussions we have with government bodies or if questioned by media representatives we need to make it very clear we cannot discuss the terms of the proposal at this time and help them understand that the Producers will have only received an executive summary and the meeting in January will be the first glance at a large complex proposal and is intended to be the beginning of a process.  Outlining this timeframe clearly stating there will be no immediate results from either receiving the proposal or the early January meeting will hopefully set the media and government minds at rest that there is no story here for a while so no need to dig further.  Normally a timeframe and a process is a better answer than no comment.

Please let me know if you have any other concerns or would like to see additional revisions.

Subject: RE: ANGTS Commercial Proposal - Executive Summary - Dec. 20 
Versi on 



Michelle - - my comments are very much based on the impact of comments as 
seen recently in TCPL's Calgary Herald article followed by the "scaled down 
pipeline" article published by the Petroleum News Alaska: 
   I firmly believe the less said in public before jan 8 discussions with 
   producers the better off we are - we do not want to negotiate this deal 
   in public. 
   I'd prefer to keep advertisements down to a minimum and keep to the 
   staight and narrow for now; hence, 
   collapse the third and fourth bullets into one very concise bullet 
   indicating a proposal being sent before year end to be followed up by a 
   meeting in early Jan - I would not say anything further about whats in 
   the proposal nor the attributes. 
   Again, in the less said the better mode - I'd delete the last two 
   bullets. 

I appreciate Tony's email on Mr. Kvisle's comments and timing and can 
understand how these types of things occur.  It indicates to me we need to 
keep to a very tight script in all discussions (media and politicians 
alike) until we make meaningful progress with the customer, hence my desire 
to keep the talking points as brief as possible so we have the most 
integrity with producers.  I'll defer to the collective wisdom of the group 
since I have no real editorial comments on your talking points - my real 
comment is policy-wise to keep them as brief as possible; i.e. all we 
really need to say right now is we're going to be meeting with producers in 
early jan on a pipeline proposal.  Thanks
