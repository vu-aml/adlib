These do not include that last round of changes that we made in getting Longview done.  Once the dust settles I intend to "update" the World Hunger docuemnt.

	In response to your request, attached please find the last
copies (7/20/01) of the World Hunger Form Agreement and the Exhibits.  I
do not know if these documents were ever approved by the "businesses".
However, the forms did serve as the basis for Longview.   
 <<World Hunger Exhibits.DOC>>  <<GE Agreement - Version 11.DOC>>
