Dear Amazon.com Customer,

What's an Amazoniversary <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/542250/ref=mk_cust_anv_2>? One year ago this month, you placed your very first order (using this e-mail address) with Amazon.com. To say thanks, we're offering you $10 off your next order of $50 or more. 

So celebrate any way you like: with a bestselling book, a new DVD release, or a CD player--it's up to you. But be sure to take advantage of this exclusive $10 savings before it expires on January 31. (See details below.)

We look forward to all your Amazoniversaries to come! 

Sincerely,
  <http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/marketing/html-mailings/signatures/david_sig.gif>
