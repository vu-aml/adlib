I THINK IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THESE DOCS YOU'LL  SEE WHERE THE PROBLEM IS.
THEWAXOH'S BID APPEARS AT 2236HRS FOR 60.00 MY BID APPEARS  ABOVE HIS AT  1647 HRS FOR 61.00 NOR 16.00 AS SEEN ON THE ACTUAL BID  DOC  AT 2236HRS. 
THERE'S A PROBLEM HERE BUT IT'S NOT MY DOING IT LOOKS LIKE  EBAY'S
PS NOTICE THAT THEWAXOH IS SIMILAR TO THORHAWK. MIGHT BE AN  INPUT ERROR BUY NOT BY ME
