DEAR SIR

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL


WE ARE MEMBERS OF A SPECIAL COMMITTEE FOR BUDGET AND
PLANNING OF THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM
CORPORATION (NNPC). THIS COMMITTEE IS PRINCIPALLY
CONCERNED WITH CONTRACT AWARDS AND APPROVAL. WITH OUR
POSITIONS, WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SECURED FOR OURSELVES
THE SUM OF TWENTY-ONE MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$21.5M). THIS AMOUNT WAS
CAREFULLY MANIPULATED BY OVER-INVOICING OF AN OLD
CONTRACT.

BASED ON INFORMATION GATHERED ABOUT YOU, WE BELIEVE
YOU WOULD BE IN A POSITION TO HELP US IN TRANSFERRING
THIS FUND (US$21.5M) INTO A SAFE ACCOUNT. IT HAS BEEN
AGREED THAT THE OWNER OF THE ACCOUNT WILL BE
COMPENSATED WITH 20% OF THE REMITTED FUNDS, WHILE WE
KEEP 70%, AND 10% WILL BE SET ASIDE TO OFFSET EXPENSES
AND PAY THE NECESSARY TAXES.

ALL MODALITIES OF THIS TRANSACTION HAVE BEEN WORKED
OUT AND ONCE STARTED WILL NOT TAKE MORE THAN 10
WORKING DAYS, WITH YOUR FULL SUPPORT. THIS TRANSACTION
IS 100% RISK FREE.

IF THIS PROPOSAL SATISFIES YOU, PLEASE REACH US ONLY
BY FAX, PHONE, OR EMAIL FOR MORE INFORMATION. IT MIGHT
BE DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH TO ME, BECAUSE OF POOR
TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEM HERE. PLEASE KEEP TRYING, YOU
WILL DEFINITELY GET THROUGH. . PLEASE TREAT AS URGENT
AND VERY CONFIDENTIAL.

YOURS FAITHFULLY,

DR.EDOZIE DANIEL.

NB.: FOR CONFIDENTIAL REASONS AND DUE TO THE POOR
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IN MY COUNTRY, MOST OFTEN FOREIGN
CALLS COULD BE DIVERTED TO THE WRONG PERSON. SO FOR
YOU TO BE VERY SURE YOU ARE RIGHTLY SPEAKING WITH ME,
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WHEN YOU CALL AND ASK FOR
ME, THE MOMENT I PICK UP THE PHONE, YOU SHOULD ASK ME
FOR THE "CODE WORD" AND MY ANSWER WOULD BE "GOD IS
GOOD" BEFORE WE PROCEED DISCUSSIONS, BUT IF I DO NOT
SAY "GOD IS GOOD", THAT MEANS YOU ARE NOT SPEAKING
WITH ME JUST DISCONNECT THE LINE AND CALL ME BACK TILL
I GIVE YOU THE CODE WORD.
