I understand that it may be difficult to get approval to hire from the outside, however I thought that you may want to review this resume.

Thanks,

Paul, 

Per our conversation, please find attached a copy of my resume. As I
mentioned, I am currently in the market intelligence group however I have
real-time experience and am very interested in returning to that area of the
power business. 

Thank you for your interest in me. I look forward to speaking with you soon
regarding opportunities with Enron.
