Karen, Et.Al.;
1. The title-topic-basis document inventories the issues and considerations included in each policy narrative.  We consolidated several policy topics, hence the reduction in overall policies.  The title document serves as an inventory of the ideas, considerations, and N-Form links appropriate to the subjects and detail included in each policy narrative.  We used this approach to keep the N-Form subject matter catalogued and to communicate the scope of the project to HR leadership.  There will be no need to replicate or have the document after the project work is completed.  
There will be some value in:	
	Synchronizing the terminology, titles, and revisions throughout the project.   
	Using the title document as our inventory reference for "content".

2.  Terminology:  A significant part of your contributions will be in the tone and phrasing of the new HR policies.  At this time, please feel free to revise, rewrite, re-organize, and or edit policy narratives, including the policy titles. We will want your team to document recommendations / justifications behind any major changes.  N-Form Group is eager to see what your combined perspectives will yield.  Recognize the need to convey acurate information will remain.  The policy narrative must include the link(s) that will to connect users to resources; other than that, your free to entertain Policy haiku. 
Regards, Rj.

Hi Rick,

In reviewing the attached documents, I have a few questions...

Who is the audience for the Title-Topic-Basis documents?  Is it a working document for this project only?  Is it important that the terminology on said documents match that of the HR narratives?  For example, the headings for several categories do not match from one piece to the other, i.e. Performance Expectations vs. Performance Communication Policy.  Just wanted to know before we went to the trouble of aligning the two...

Thanks,
Karen Phillips (Content Team)
