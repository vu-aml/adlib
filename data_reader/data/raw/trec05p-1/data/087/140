The first elaboration iteration (E1) was officially completed on Wednesday Oct 17.  A demonstration of the current functionality was presented to Anthony late yesterday afternoon.  We achieved the majority of our goals including:  capturing, saving, and valuing a retail gen swap deal.  This thread through the system touched each of the architectural layers to demonstrate connectivity between them.  

Thanks for all your hard work in completing the iteration!!   We learned a lot, and are now on the way to delivering a quality system.  The second elaboration iteration (E2) starts today.  The primary functional goals of the iteration are:  capture and value the retail bundled swap, provide the capability to edit and save deals, and provide valuation results to the user.  The target completion date is Nov 2.  I'm looking forward to another successful iteration.

Good job everyone!

Regards,
Susan
