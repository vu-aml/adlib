ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

PREVIEW for January 6, 2001

======================================

Dear Folks -

   I know that lists like the following pop up now and again on the
internet. This one, sent to me by George Leyendecker, has some fresh
ones –

   1. The best way to get even is to forget.
   2. Feed your faith and your doubts will starve to death.
   3. God wants spiritual fruit, not religious nuts.
   4. Some folks wear their halos much too tight.
   5. Some marriages are made in heaven, but they ALL have to be
maintained on earth.
   6. Unless you can create the WHOLE universe in 5 days, then perhaps
giving "advice" to God, isn't such a good idea!
   7. Sorrow looks back, worry looks around, and faith looks up.
   8. Standing in the middle of the road is dangerous. You will get
knocked down by the traffic from both ways.
   9. Words are windows to the heart.
  10. A skeptic is a person who when he sees the handwriting on the
wall, claims it's a forgery.
  11. It isn't difficult to make a mountain out of a molehill just add
a little dirt.
  12. A successful marriage isn't finding the right person, it's being
the right person.
  13. The mighty oak tree was once a little nut that held its ground.
  14. Too many people offer God prayers, with claw marks all over them.
  15. The tongue must be heavy indeed, because so few people can hold
it.
  16. To forgive is to set the prisoner free, and then discover the
prisoner was you.
  17. You have to wonder about humans, they think God is dead and Elvis
is alive!
  18. It's all right to sit on your pity pot every now and again. Just
be sure to flush when you are done.
  19. You'll notice that a turtle only makes progress when it sticks
out its neck.
  20. If the grass is greener on the other side of the fence, you can
bet the water bill is higher.
  21. You are richer today if you have laughed, given, and forgiven.

   These are pithy sentences that can cause us to laugh and to think.

   There is another phrase I use in our work from time to time. It is -

   Having a heart as light as a feather.

   What does that mean?
    Is it possible?
     If it is, what keeps us from experiencing it more?

   These are some of the questions I want to talk with you about when
we gather this Sunday. I invite you –
   to be present,
    to bring your heart,
     to be prepared to lay aside some of your burdens, and
      to dare to open some doors to new life.

   My heart is hoping to see you Sunday.

Much love,

Bill Kerley
