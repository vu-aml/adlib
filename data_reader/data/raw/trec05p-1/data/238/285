Eat me, Wollam.  Did you notice the "Out of Office" message from my email,
home slice?

Not sure what the 20 "MAN NIGHT" emails are in my inbox from yesterday, but
noted the Thurs. night dinner.  I have conflict which I will try to unwind
for my attendance.  However, not sure that we want to be at Tony's on such
night, based on what my co-worker says!
