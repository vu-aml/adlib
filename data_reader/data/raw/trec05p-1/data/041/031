From Mr. Ivan Poski.

Hello Dear,

I am Mr. Ivan Poski, a member of the Ovasi Rebel movement. A rebel group secretly sponsored by late president Ronald Reagan and Mr. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the embattled chairman, CEO of Yukos oil Menatap SBP Bank.

The Ovasi rebel group contributed immensely in the revolution that sent President Charles Taylor on exile. Beside our fight for equality and political stability in Africa was the lusaka Diamond and crude oil, we also had control over the Lusaka Diamond mines & some oil pipe lines, which was a joint investment between late President Reagan and Mr. Khodorkovsky.

Diamonds were being mined and sold to French and Arabian dealers for many years. On 28th of may 2004 before the death of late president Reagan the sum of US$360million was realized from the sales of the Diamonds at the Lusaka Mines and as usual was disbursed according to the agreement among the war lords, the local chiefs and the foreign sponsors. 

The sum of US$20m and US$15m was sent to late President Reagan and Mr. Khodorkovsky respectively. All funds previously sent to them were usually done through a European security transport Agency. The Agency moves the money from Africa to Europe where it is delivered to one European broker who helps them deposit the funds in different Financial House in Europe. 

On this particular transaction I had delays in sending a confirmation of the arrival of the funds in Europe before the CNN announcement of the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky.
Based on this counter, i immediately seek asylum in Africa for my safety.
Right now the funds are still with the broker in Europe waiting for instructions on how they are to be Delivered.
 
YOUR ROLE:
If you agree on my terms, I will give you every detail you require to present yourself to the broker as an associate to Mr. Khodorkovsky and he will send the Packaged funds to wherever you instruct him, although I am still in asylum.

MY TERMS:

(1) I will take 70% of the funds when you get it.
(2) You will have to open a joint bank account of which I will be a signatory where the funds would be deposited.
If this is okay by you, notify me immediately in good time so that we can proceed.

Respectfully,
Ivan Poski
