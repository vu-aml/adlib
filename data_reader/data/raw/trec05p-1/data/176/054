Latest NFL Player News

Jeff Graham <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. 

Antowain Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 12/23/01
Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.

Jeff Garcia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 12/23/01
Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB. 

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 12/23/01
George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the game.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/23/01
Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.

Fred Beasley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=12207&>, RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season. 

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 12/21/01
Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/21/01
A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Donald Hayes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/21/01
Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17. 

Chris Weinke <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 12/21/01
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 12/21/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.

Rich Gannon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1034&> , QB OAK - Martin Updated 12/21/01
Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched. 

Randy Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.

Marvin Minnis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.

Rod Gardner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable. 

Tony Richardson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1471&>, RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 12/21/01
Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.

Trent Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 12/21/01
Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/21/01
Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason. 

Johnnie Morton <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1223&>, WR DET - Hunter Updated 12/21/01
Morton has been inconsistent this season but he will still be a solid No. 2 during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup.

Reggie Wayne <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement. But he is not accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams. 

Amani Toomer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 12/21/01
Toomer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2 wideout during your playoffs.

Marvin Harrison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1231&>, WR IND - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not in the playoff race. 

Duce Staley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 12/21/01
Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs. 

Shawn Bryson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=133240&>, RB BUF - Neal/McKay Updated 12/21/01
Bryson will start in place of the injured Travis Henry this week. Consider him as a No. 2 RB if you need help at that spot. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Thrash was not very consistent during the regular season and may not catch a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season. He will be a No. 2 wideout at best during the Fantasy playoffs.
