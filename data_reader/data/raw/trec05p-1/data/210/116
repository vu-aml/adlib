MR.SIMON WONG
DAH SING BANK LTD.
DES VOEUX RD.BRANCH,
CENTRAL HONG KONG,
HONK KONG.
email:simwong240@netscape.net

I am Mr.Simon Wong, credit officer of the Dah Sing Bank Ltd.I have a
concealed business suggestion for you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war,our
client General. Hassan Fazi who was with the Iraqi forces and also
business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a
value of Fourty Three Million,Six Hundred Thousand United State Dollars
only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice  was sent to him, even
during the war early this year.Again after the war another notification
was sent and  still no response came from him. We later find out that
the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast
that hit their home.

After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Hassan
Fazi did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the
paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last
time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my
bank.So, Fourty Three Million,Six Hundred Thousand United State Dollars
is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it
What bothers me most is that
according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration three
years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if 
=

nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion
to you is that I will like you
as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen.Hassan Fazi so that
you will be able to receive his funds.
WHAT IS TO BE DONE:
I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we
shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare
the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to
Gen.Hassan Fazi ,all that is required from you at this stage is for you to
provide me with your full Names and address so that the attorney can
commence his job.
After you have been made the next of kin,the attorney will also fill in
for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter
of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that
will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter
as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare
all the necessary documents.

Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning
this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank
account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and
5%for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation.Should you
be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for
easy communication, you can write me via my private box
thus:(simwong240@netscape.net)  and i will provide you with more details of 
=

this operation.


Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards,

Mr.Simon Wong
