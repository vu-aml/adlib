Crude Oil Futures Fall

    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX fell $0.79 
to $18.89 per barrel yesterday as the market continues to focus on 
bulging inventories, driven higher by a sharp drop in demand as a 
result of the absence of sustained cold weather in the Northeast. 
Traders are continuing to look for signs of an actual decrease in 
exports by OPEC and non-cartel producers. Many question how 
stringently OPEC and non-aligned producers will comply with new 
production curbs aimed at removing nearly 2.0 million bpd from the 
worlds supplies. Reports that Saudi Arabia is notifying customers of 
cuts in February volumes have led some to speculate that compliance 
was not all that great in January. Traders are also looking at 
Russian refined-product exports which, if increased, would offset its 
pledge to cut crude exports by 150,000 bpd. With the API report due 
out later today, it is also likely that some are just taking a wait 
and see stance. However, there are predictions that distillate demand 
will improve somewhat after 3 consecutive weeks of huge inventory 
increases. A drop in gasoline and heating oil futures also pressured 
the market downward. Heating oil futures for February delivery on the 
NYMEX slid $0.0228 to $0.5166 per gallon. February gasoline futures 
on the NYMEX lost $0.0226 to $0.5505 per gallon. In London, Brent 
crude oil futures for February delivery on the IPE were down $1.08 to 
$19.78 per barrel as they are set to expire on Wednesday. March Brent 
crude futures dropped $0.99 to 18.93 per barrel.

Conoco Attractive Prospect for Totalfina and Shell 


    The merger between Phillips and Conoco may face some stiff 
hurdles, namely TotalFina Elf and Royal Dutch/Shell. The two major 
European oil companies are both looking at the possibility of 
stealing Conoco from Phillips. Either company could appeal to 
Conoco's shareholders, some of whom are upset that they were not 
offered a takeover premium by Phillips. TotalFina Elf has long been 
looking to expand its presence in the North American market and was 
thought to be sizing up Conoco before the Phillips deal was 
announced. Shell has only made $6 billion worth of acquisitions over 
the past 3 years and finds itself with an abundance of cash that it 
needs to spend. Tax complications prevent it from repurchasing stock 
as other companies have done and due to the recent rash of mergers, 
there is a shortage of viable projects in which to invest. If Shell 
pursues less viable projects, returns on capital will suffer, but 
that will happen if it keeps storing up cash so a takeover of Conoco 
presents an attractive alternative for the company. However, 
Totalfina is seen as having a better chance than many of gaining US 
regulatory approval. Shell, BP, ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco are 
constrained because of their already sizable presence in the US. One 
problem other bidders for Conoco could encounter is the hefty $550 
million breakup fee that Phillips and Conoco have written into their 
contract to discourage any attempts to kill the deal.

ExxonMobil to Supply Kuwait with Qatar Natural Gas 

    ExxonMobil has reached an agreement to supply Kuwait with natural 
gas from Qatar's giant North Field. The agreement between ExxonMobil, 
Kuwait Petroleum and Qatar Petroleum calls for production from the 
Enhanced Gas Utilization project in Qatar's North Field to be 
supplied to Kuwait. Capacity of the project is about 1.75 Bcf per 
day. Qatar has the world's 3rd-largest natural gas reserves and is 
seeking to increase exports to the Gulf region after investing 
billions of dollars for drilling. Kuwait needs to secure a steady 
natural gas supply to meet power generation needs.

Canadian Energy Companies' Profits Tumble

   Canada's energy companies will have the weakest quarterly results 
in 2 years, due to slumping oil and natural gas prices. The recession 
has meant sharp drops in both commodity prices in the 4th quarter as 
demand fell. Suncor has warned will be a drop in net earnings of as 
much as 75% from the 3rd quarter. Analysts are forecasting almost 
every energy company in 2002 to have lower earnings and cash flow 
than in 2001, and then positive increments again in 2003. Suncor 
warned of weaker results on Friday, with numbers showing net income 
would fall into the C$18 million to C$22 million range, down from 
C$73 million in the 3rd quarter and C$111 million a year earlier. 
Besides the lower prices, Suncor had higher than expected costs for 
starting up the C$3.4 billion expansion of its northern Alberta oil 
sands operation, and squeezed profit margins in its refining segment, 
a situation expected to hit all the integrated companies. The impact 
of weaker prices has already caused drilling activity to fall below 
last year's record levels and recent predictions that overall 
spending in 2002 will 25% below 2001 levels.
