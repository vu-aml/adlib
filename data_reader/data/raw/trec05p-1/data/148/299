Attached are my Louisiana counsel's comments to our ROW form.  I agree with his changes.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

Gerald:

    I reviewed the enclosed agreement and made several revisions.  I am
enclosing a redlined version showing my revisions for your convenience.
 My major revisions are summarized as follows:

    1.  I changed all references to "rights of way" or "easement", to
"servitude" or "sevitude of right of use".  Louisiana law does not use
the terms "easement" or "right of way".

    2.  I rearranged the last three clauses in the 1st paragraph for
clarity.

    3.  I combined the content of the 5th paragraph into the 3d paragraph.

    4.  I change the 6th paragraph slightly to strengthen the rights
retained by Grantor.

    5.  I added language to paragraph 7 to give more detail to the
process of abandonment and to strengthen the rights of the Grantor upon
abandonment.

 Please call with any questions or if you need further help with this.
 Thank you for allowing me to provide professional advice on this matter.

Keith
