Featuring Lutts' Logic:

Major Changes in Perception Take Longer Than Expected

My Favorite Solar Power Stock

Modern-Day Easter Eggs

-----

The longer I'm in the investing business, the more truths I accumulate. 
Some of these are well known, like "Cut losses short" and "Never fight the
tape", while others are more obscure.

These truisms usually work because they're shorthand reminders of lessons
I've learned the hard way.  Who among us hasn't held a losing stock far
longer than we should have, arguing that the great fundamentals would
eventually be recognized by other investors?  And who among us hasn't
hesitated to buy into a powerful new bull market, arguing that fundamental
problems would pull stocks down?  I have, but I don't any more.  And those
well-worn aphorisms are part of the reason.

The truism that's on my mind today is not so pithy as those above, and
certainly not as well-known but I've found it useful when dealing with big
trends.  Here it is.

"Major changes of perception take longer than expected, on both the
individual and the group level."

And the reason I'm thinking of this truism is global warming.

So let's start with a question.  How long do you think it's been since the
first evidence of human-influenced global warming was noted by scientists?
 Ten years?  Twenty years?  Stop to think a minute.   
Make your best guess, and then read on.

 A little research reveals that the first definitive measurements were
made in the 1950s by Charles Keeling, who spent years collecting carbon
dioxide samples on Mauna Loa in Hawaii, two miles above sea level.  The
National Science Foundation used his data to warn of the greenhouse effect
in 1963.

And here we are 44 years later, with more and more people every day
climbing on the global warming bandwagon, not least because of Al Gore's
movie, "An Inconvenient Truth."

But there remain plenty of doubters, in two main groups (in my opinion).

The first group includes skeptics who demand absolute proof, which is
difficult to provide, simply because climate science is so complex.

The second group includes those - generally conservatives - who don't
trust the messengers - usually liberals - because they perceive these
liberals as having an anti-business (particularly anti-big-oil) agenda.

Fact is, it's hard to change your opinion.  So, while the change in
perceptions continues, that change tends to happen slowly, both on the
individual level and on the group level.

And as investors, perception is extremely important to us, because changes
in perception move stocks!

But when as big a figure as Newt Gingrich stands up with John Kerry and
apologizes for the Republican Party's intransigence on the issue, saying,
in part, "For most of the last 30 years, the environment has been a
powerful emotional tool for bigger government and higher taxes. And
therefore, if you're a conservative, the minute you start hearing these
arguments, you know what's coming next: which is bigger government and
higher taxes.  So even though it may be the right thing to do, you end up
fighting it because you don't want big government and higher taxes." you
know we've passed an important milestone.

That surprise announcement followed by a few days the latest release by
the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which gave further
detail on droughts, floods, and other extreme weather, saying more of
these disasters are to be expected as a short-term result of too much
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

And this followed by a few weeks the semi-annual adjusting of the NASDAQ
Clean Edge U.S. Index (CLEN).  This index, admittedly not widely followed
yet, is designed to track the performance of clean-energy companies that
are publicly traded in the U.S.  It includes companies engaged in emerging
clean-energy technologies such as solar photovoltaics, biofuels and
advanced batteries. The five major sub-sectors that the indexes cover are
Renewable Electricity Generation, Renewable Fuels, Energy Storage &
Conversion, Energy Intelligence and Advanced Energy-Related Materials.

Tossed out of the index in March, for their general failure to thrive,
were Active Power (ACPW), C&D Technologies (CHP), Capstone Turbine (CPST),
Distributed Energy Systems (DESC), Hydrogenics (HYGS), Quantum Fuel
Systems Technologies Worldwide (QTWW) and Vicor (VICR).

Added to the index, for their current strength and high potential, were
Canadian Solar (CSIQ), First Solar (FSLR), JA Solar Holdings (JASO),
Solarfun (SOLF), Trina Solar (TSL) and US BioEnergy (USBE).   
It doesn't take a genius to notice that the word "solar" appears in five
of those six companies' names!

Fact is, these companies are burning up the track!  They're growing
revenues at triple-digit rates, and they still can't make solar cells fast
enough to meet demand!

So, think back to my original truism, "Major changes of perception take
longer than expected, on both the individual and the group level." 
Project the current shift in public perception forward, and imagine a
world where more and more attention is focused on reducing greenhouse
gases.  Recognize that the 44-year trend of public perception regarding
global warming has much further to go.  And then think about becoming an
investor in one or more of the companies that will benefit.  I suggest you
start with First Solar.

Here's what I wrote in a recent issue of the Cabot Market Letter:

"Possibly the leading glamour stock in the market right now is First Solar
(FSLR), a producer of solar cells and modules.  This isn't just your
ordinary solar cell maker - there are a handful of them around, all
growing fast.  First Solar has a different method of producing its cells,
and that's making all the difference.  Specifically, the company uses a
thin-film technology, which requires just a fraction of the silicon used
in standard solar cells. With silicon in tight demand . . . that means
First Solar's costs are much, much lower than its competitors.  In the
fourth quarter, the company's costs were $1.25 per watt produced, and with
a bunch of long-term contracts in place that will generate more than $2
billion of revenue over the next few years, the company can expand its
production capacity knowing the demand will be there.  That increased
production will help lower costs further.  The company has a stated goal
of being cost competitive with standard electricity by 2010 - without
subsidies.  So far, management is exceeding all of its goals, and growth
is superb; revenues were up 288% and 146% the past two quarters, while
earnings have jumped into the black, to $0.06 and $0.12 per share during
that time.  And the stock, which soared in mid-February after a blowout
earnings report, fell 19% as the market tumbled . . . but then came
roaring back, actually tagging new peaks . . ."

As always, you should buy carefully; all these stocks are big movers, both
up and down, and you'll want to buy smart to improve your chances of
success.  But there's no questioning the massive growth potential of this
group going forward.

While I'm at it, here are a couple of other ideas on the clean energy
bandwagon.

One is chip-equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT), which climbed more
than 4% one day last week after an analyst said the firm's solar power
equipment business could accelerate far faster than most believe.  No
surprise there.  But what caught my eye was the degree of acceleration. 
While management had projected that sales to solar companies would hit
$500 million in 2010, the broker estimated they'd hit $1.5 to $2 billion,
three to four times as high!  Applied Materials is a huge company, and its
chart is no better than tepid today, but it's good to see those
projections.

A more interesting play on clean energy is Zoltek (ZOLT) a company whose
low-cost carbon fiber is in high demand by makers of the blades of wind
turbines.  In the fourth quarter, Zoltek's revenue grew 95% to $30.3
million.  Equally important, analysts are expecting the company to have
positive earnings this year for the first time since 1998!  ZOLT's chart
is strong now.

Finally, there's Cameco (CCJ), the biggest supplier of the uranium used in
nuclear power plants.  Cameco has been growing revenues every year for the
past decade.  It's been profitable for every one of those years too, so
you know it's well managed.  And the stock, after spending eleven months
in a basing pattern, has just broken out to new highs on gargantuan
volume, a sign that big investors are getting back in.

Finally, an Easter story, with a long preamble.

A few months ago I wrote a piece about our young Ukrainian friends.   
To recap: four years ago my wife and I hosted a 15-year-old girl from
Ukraine, Halyna, who spent four weeks at an American high school with our
daughter, and then returned to Ukraine.  In the years following that
visit, she moved on to the University at Kiev, transferred to the
University of Lethbridge in Alberta, Canada, and this year transferred to
Salem State College, where she's majoring in business administration.  Now
19, she's both smart and pretty and no doubt will succeed at whatever she
tries.

Halyna now lives in Salem with her fiancé, Andriy, who's also from the
same town in Ukraine.  And living with us now for two weeks is a new high
school girl, Nataliya, here for the same one-month exchange.

What all these people seek is a better life.  As they put it, "There are
no jobs in Ukraine."

Andriy's college degree, earned in Kiev, is in accounting.  But he's
making better money here working in the construction business.   
Andriy's mother, back in Ukraine, is an eye doctor.  Working for the
state, 35 hours a week, she earns 150 dollars per month.  Nataliya's
mother is a dental assistant, working in . . . Rome, Italy.  That's where
the money is.

Someday Ukraine will offer more opportunity, but progress happens slowly. 
Freed from the control of the Soviet Union just sixteen years ago, the
country lacks the entrepreneurial spirit that drives the world's
faster-growing economies.  It's still weighed down by a heavy bureaucracy.
 And its government is in turmoil; on April 3, President Yuschenko
(claiming deep corruption) signed a bill dissolving Parliament, but
Parliament declined to dissolve, and now the case will head to the Supreme
Court.

Anyway, I mentioned last week that our family would hide 14 dozen eggs for
assorted family and friends on Easter, and so we did.  But first we spent
hours on Saturday afternoon dying every single one.   
It's our tradition, and it's a lot of fun, especially when you have
artists in the family.

But knowing the old Ukrainian tradition of dying Easter eggs, I was
looking forward to Sunday, hoping to see some superior artisanry.  On that
big day, however, the Ukrainians first joined other friends at church, and
then went off to a full Ukrainian dinner.  So it wasn't until late in the
day that they returned to our house, bringing traditional Easter bread and
eggs decorated with black, red and gold designs.  For a split-second, my
hopes were fulfilled.  But then I noticed the designs were on pre-printed
shrink-wrap sleeves, just like most Americans buy.

Disappointed, yes.  Surprised, not really.  Traditions, like everything
else, are subject to the forces of change.  But now I find myself
wondering if those shrink-wrap designs were made in China, where low wages
and a thriving spirit of entrepreneurship make the manufacture of almost
anything not just possible but likely.

In fact, in Saturday's issue of Cabot Wealth Advisory, we'll take a look
at Communism and Capitalism in China, from an insider's perspective.

Yours in pursuit of wisdom and wealth,
