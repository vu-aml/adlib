How are you this morning?
I slept really well last night.
Just trying to get some contracts written and signed up here.
It's cooler today and still very very windy. Only supposed to be 50 today, but back to 70 this weekend.

I see that houston is now offering a half marathon.......are you interested?
I wouldn't mind doing that and Andy with Pennaco said he wouldn't mind running it either.

Hope all is well.

Have a great day!!

Mike
