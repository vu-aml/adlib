"I'm so busy on the trading floor, I need a product that has a finger that comes out of the screen pokes me when I need to pay attention. Can you make me one of those?"
 
A client of FriedWire made this request some time ago.  In an attempt to server his needs we considered being the first company to provide personal desktop robots for traders, but at a staff meeting we determined that no one here knew anything about robots.  So instead we developed a flexible electronic event notification system.
 
In FriedWire's Traffic Report, the notification system delivers market news and transmission emergency information.  In PowerSurge the notification system provides Price Alerts.  If you need to know when prices change or reach certain upper or lower limits, and you don't want to stare at the screen all day, you might want to check out this PowerSurge feature.
 
The Price Alerts (a.k.a "My Price Alerts") are completely customizable for each FriedWire login.  An easy-to-use interface allows you to select:
the price nodes and markets of interest to you, 
when to be contacted (when prices rise or fall according to your criteria), 
how to be contacted (e-mail or wireless page), 
when during the day/week to notify you and how often,
and more!

Once you have customized your alerts, you can review them in the list of "My Price Alerts"  Here you can turn them on or off, edit, or delete them. We recommend that you take advantage of the ability to set custom alert names and alert messages.  These help you remember your strategy when you created the alert.
 
[IMAGE]
 
You can review your alerts within PowerSurge when you see "You Have Alerts!" in the upper left corner of the screen.  Clicking on that link will display your current alerts.

But if you're not logged in to PowerSurge when your event happens, don't worry because the same information will also appear in your email inbox or wireless pager/cell phone.
 
Login to PowerSurge to see this and other features.
