Hi Folks,

Doing our best to get these to you early in the week as you juggle your
lineups for this final week 17.   Here's how I see the Rushing Game Matchups
this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly
where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive
emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but
listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup
may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start
the player with the best matchup.   Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup
one week but unless you're sitting on Ricky Williams or Marshall Faulk,
Green's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.  (Yes, even after
last week's performance)  The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool
in your box when it comes to deciding between players.

Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.
http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position
numbers are from ESPN.com.   Target numbers are from our Footballguy Andy
Hicks.
Let's get to it.

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/



Locks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.


Baltimore's Terry Allen vs Minnesota Defense

Terry Allen ran hard last week where he rushed 20 times for 74 yards (3.3
ypc) against a tough Buc team.   It'll be much easier this week against the
swiss cheese Vikings ranked # 30 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   Although, these Vikings did shut down Ahman Green last week.
For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Denver's Terrell Davis vs Indianapolis Defense

Terrell Davis looked good again rushing for 89 yards on 18 carries (4.9 ypc)
It's been a tough year and you can bet he'll want to finish strong.   The
Colts rank # 23 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New England's Antowain Smith vs Carolina Defense

A rested Antowain Smith faces the soft Carolina defense that's ranked # 31
in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Great matchup.


Pittsburgh's Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala / Jerome Bettis vs Cleveland Defense

Fuamatu-Ma'afala was a workhorse on the ground Sunday but didn't have a lot
to show for it.   He ran 25 times for 55 yards (2.2 ypc)   He did score on a
receiving TD.   He'll face a weak Cleveland defense ranked # 29 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 20
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Washington's Stephen Davis vs Arizona Defense

Stephen Davis looked great rushing for 111 yards on 21 carries (5.3 ypc) and
the score.   He left with a knee tweak but it doesn't look to be serious.
Ki-Jana Carter played great after Davis left.   The Cardinals rank # 21 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong
lately.


Buffalo's Shawn Bryson / Travis Henry / Sammy Morris vs Miami Defense

Bryson ran wild again rushing 28 times for 107 yards (3.8 ypc).   Sammy
Morris spelled him for a few carries and looked good too but it seems Bryson
is clearly the man here.   It's possible Henry could see action so keep an
eye on this one through the week.   The Dolphins have fallen down to # 28 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Dallas' Emmitt Smith vs Detroit Defense

Emmitt looked very solid again rushing for 126 yards on 26 carries (4.8 ypc)
although he failed to score.   He needs a little over 60 yards to get 1,000
for the season so you can bet he'll be gunning for that.   The Lions rank #
18 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 24 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New York Giants' Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Green Bay Defense

Barber saw more action with 16 carries and 71 yards (4.4 ypc) but it was
Dayne who scored with 59 yards on 8 carries (7.4 ypc)   Barber was very
active again in the passing game.   The Packers let Michael Bennett run well
Sunday and have slipped to # 27 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs.


New York Jet's Curtis Martin vs Oakland Defense

Martin put in another Martin Like day with 115 yards on 19 carries (6.1 ypc)
The Jets may have problems, but Martin isn't one.   He'll face an Oakland
defense ranked # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Oakland's Charlie Garner vs New York Jets Defense

The Raiders don't look nearly as strong as they did.   Garner only had 9
carries Sunday for 23 yards (2.6 ypc)   Tyrone Wheatley only had 5 carries.
This week they've got a nice matchup as they'll face the Jets ranked # 26 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Seattle's Shaun Alexander vs Kansas City Defense

Alexander didn't do much Sunday rushing 23 times for 59 yards (2.6 ypc)   He
'll be ok though and gets to face a Chief defense ranked # 22 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


St. Louis' Marshall Faulk vs Atlanta Defense

Start Faulk.   The question will be of course how much he plays but it was
pretty obvious Sunday that Mike Martz lets his guys play.   Trung Canidate
could have really used the work but he warmed the bench while Faulk went
nuts.   I'd say you'll get at least a half, maybe much more out of Faulk and
half of Faulk is worth more than most backs.   The Falcons rank # 24 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 28 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.




/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Arizona's Michael Pittman vs Washington Defense

Just when it looked like Michael Pittman was going to take over the clear
cut # 1 RB role, Thomas Jones steps in with 16 carries.   Pittman rushed 12
times for 89 yards (7.4 ypc) which was bolstered by a 39 yarder.   Jones ran
for 69 yards on 16 carries (4.3 ypc)   This was Carolina, though.   This
week will feature a tougher test with Washington ranked # 8 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they've been pretty
soft though and rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Kansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson vs Seattle Defense

Priest Holmes ran 27 times for 91 yards (3.4 ypc) plus the score.   Tony
Richardson didn't have a carry.   This week, he'll face the Seahawks ranked
# 12 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Miami's Lamar Smith / Travis Minor vs Buffalo Defense

This is getting embarrassing.   Smith rushed 7 times for 4 yards (0.6 ypc)
Travis Minor had 33 yards on 9 carries (3.7 ypc)   He's becoming less and
less of a factor with each game.   The Dolphins are in the playoffs but find
themselves playing a different style of ball than they have been.   Minor's
a threat to go long on the screen passes and Smith is a long shot for a
cheap TD.   They'll face the Bills ranked # 13 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
Game over the last 4 weeks and # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Minnesota's Michael Bennett vs Baltimore Defense

We said Bennett just needed carries and he got them Sunday rushing 25 times
for 104 yards (4.2 ypc)   He'll face a Baltimore defense that's numbers don'
t back up it's reputation this week - they rank # 25 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New Orleans' Ricky Williams vs San Francisco Defense

Even though he didn't score, it was a better performance by Williams who
rushed 17 times for 74 yards (4.4 ypc)   The Saints clearly want him to be
more involved as he was Sunday.   This week, he'll face a 49er defense
ranked # 17 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 18
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


San Francisco's Garrison Hearst vs New Orleans Defense

Garrison Hearst was a non factor Sunday with just 35 yards on 11 carries
(3.2 ypc)   Kevan Barlow didn't do much either so it wasn't like he lost
time to another player.   This week, he gets the Saints who rank # 15 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Tampa Bay's Warrick Dunn / Mike Alstott vs Philadelphia Defense

Tampa's One-Two punch continues to work.   Alstott had 80 yards on 14
carries (5.7 ypc) and Dunn carried the ball 13 times for 47 yards (3.6 ypc)
Alstott's been more effective on the ground but Dunn seems to be more
involved in the passing game.   This week, they'll face an Eagle defense
ranked # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 9
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.




/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong
lately.


Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Tennessee Defense

Dillon showed again he can run on any defense.   He had 91 yards on 21
carries (4.3 ypc) against the Steelers.   He'll face the Titans this week
ranked # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks so it won
't get much easier.   They rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Detroit's Lamont Warren / James Stewart vs Dallas Defense

The Detroit RBs were horrible on the ground in this one with Lamont Warren
gaining 19 yards on 6 carries (3.2 ypc).   Cory Schlesinger did catch 11
passes though so maybe he's worth a longshot pick there.   The Cowboys rank
# 14 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 12 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Green Bay's Ahman Green vs New York Giants Defense

Green was shut down on the ground with just 31 yards on 16 carries (1.9 ypc)
although he did score.   Go figure.   He's still too good to sit in my
opinion.   This week, he'll face the Giants ranked # 10 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 3 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so it's a tough matchup, although I think I'd
start Green unless you really have a solid alternative.


Indianapolis' Dominic Rhodes vs Denver Defense

Again, Dominic Rhodes looked excellent rushing for 83 yards on 20 carries
(4.2 ypc) with a score.   He'll face the Broncos this week ranked # 7 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   The Broncos are definitely
surging after the win in Oakland but I still like Rhodes.


Jacksonville's Stacey Mack vs Chicago Defense

Mack went off last week with 125 yards on 16 carries (7.8 ypc) and a score.
It'll be tougher this week against Chicago that ranks # 9 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Philadelphia's Duce Staley vs Tampa Bay Defense

Staley's receiving numbers had been carrying him lately and this week he
paid the price.   He only rushed 8 times for 23 yards (2.9 ypc) and was shut
 down receiving with just 2 receptions for -1 yards.   This week, he'll face
a surging Buc defense ranked # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last 4 weeks and # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Tennessee's Eddie George vs Cincinnati Defense

Eddie George looked the old Eddie Sunday with 130 yards on 26 carries (5.0
ypc)   Plus 2 scores.  This week he'll face a Bengal defense ranked # 11 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.




/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong
lately.


Atlanta's Maurice Smith vs St. Louis Defense

Again, Maurice Smith ran poorly but got a cheap TD.   He managed just 38
yards on 15 carries (2.5 ypc).   Bob Christian stole 10 carries where he
gained 33 yards (3.3 ypc)   They're both a gamble against a tough Ram
defense ranked # 3 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Carolina's Richard Huntley vs New England Defense

Huntley ran pretty well last week gaining 62 yards on 12 carries (5.2 ypc).
He just didn't get enough carries for this awful Carolina team.   That won't
get any better this week agains the Patriots ranked # 2 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 16 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Chicago's Anthony Thomas vs Jacksonville Defense

Thomas ran 25 times for 76 yards (3.0 ypc) Sunday.   He'll face a tougher
defense in Jacksonville that's been awesome lately ranking # 1 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 8
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Thomas is still probably a starter in
most leagues, but the Jaguars have been extremely stingy of late.


Cleveland's Jamel White vs Pittsburgh Defense

White only had 42 yards on 21 carries (2.0 ypc) but did score twice.   Corey
Dillon showed the Steeler defense wasn't perfect last week.  They're still
tough though ranked # 4 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.
