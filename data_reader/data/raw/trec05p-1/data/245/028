Dear Ms. Corman                                       
                                         

Make Tax Day More Rewarding!

Maybe you can't avoid paying taxes. But you can make it quick and 
easy -- and earn Membership Rewards(R) points. Just use the
American Express(R) Card to pay your individual federal income tax
by phone or online, and if you're enrolled in the Membership Rewards 
program, you will earn one point for virtually every eligible dollar 
you charge*.

Here's all you have to do:

1. File your individual federal tax return (Form 1040) by paper or
electronically.

2. Use your American Express Card to make your payment by phone or
online:

Official Payments Corporation
1-800-2PAY-TAX (1-800-272-9829)
Click Here http://www.officialpayments.com <http://tm0.com/americanexpress/sbct.cgi?s=86351074&i=474154&m=2&d=2375058>

That's it. Paying taxes has never been so easy -- or convenient.
You can also use the Card to pay federal estimated taxes (Form
1040-ES), or when requesting an extension to file your federal tax 
return (Form 4868).  And you may be eligible to pay state income taxes
as well. Simply visit 
http://www.officialpayments.com <http://tm0.com/americanexpress/sbct.cgi?s=86351074&i=474154&m=2&d=2375059> 
to see if your state is a participant.

So use the American Express Card -- and get something out of paying
your taxes this year.

All federal and state tax payments made with the Card are
subject to a convenience fee by Official Payments Corporation.

*To earn points, you must be enrolled in the Membership Rewards
program at the time of your charge and you must charge your tax
payment on an eligible, enrolled American Express Card.
