Ken- Thanks for the note. I too am trying to be optimistic, but there is
far too much uncertainty for me and , more importantly, my family with
Enron being  in a constant state of "teetering". There are few places in
Houston( which is where it is our strong preference to stay) that
interest me, but Dynegy is one of them. Please let me know when would be
a good time to talk, if it makes sense at all from your perspective.
Thanks again.- Rick

	Rick - Thanks for the note. The reduction in budget to $9.4
million is 
	indeed dramatic, but appears to be necessary under the
circumstances. We 
	continure to be optimistic also, but I certainly understand the
need to be 
	realistic. Hope you have gotten some rest and I look forward to
speaking 
	with you next week. Ken (P.S. you and Steve Kean and the rest of
your 
	government affairs team can be proud of all you have
accomplished in 
	advocating deregulation in natural gas and power markets in the
US and 
	abroad!)
