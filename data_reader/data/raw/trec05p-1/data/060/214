Jeff - I'm told by our core procurement people that Enron has refused to
enter into any term gas contracts for this winter because of problems they
have with us on the electric side.  Personally, that makes no sense to me.
We have the PUC's security order that guarantees payment and Judge Montali
has made it clear that he will approve the payment on all gas contracts.  It
seems to me that if this is true, Enron is really screwing itself - which is
no the way Enron typically does business. Can you check with your people ?
We are now in the process of finalizing our needs for the winter.
