There, now, the truth is out. And I will own, that when people saw my
father perched up in front of the omnibus of death, dressed in his long,
wide, black cloak, and his black-edged, three-cornered hat on his head, and
then glanced at his round, jocund face, round as the sun, they could not
think much of sorrow or the grave. That face said, "It is nothing, it will
all end better than people think." So I have inherited from him, not only my
good temper, but a habit of going often to the churchyard, which is good,
when done in a proper humor; and then also I take in the Intelligencer, just
as he used to do.<BR>
anything about that. Melanie'd be so disappointed you weren't <BR>
and good temper."
