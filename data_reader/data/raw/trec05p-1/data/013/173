Hi Hon...Jack forwarded this to us 
Subject: Fw: PANCAKES  
Six-year-old Brandon decided one Saturday morning to fix his parents  
pancakes. He found a big bowl and spoon, pulled a chair to the counter,  
opened the cupboard and pulled out the heavy flour canister, spilling it  
on  
the floor. He scooped some of the flour into the bowl with his hands,  
mixed  
in most of a cup of milk and added some sugar, leaving a floury trail on  
the  
floor which by now had a few tracks left by his kitten.  
Brandon was covered with flour and getting frustrated. He wanted this to  
be  
something very good for Mom and Dad, but it was getting very bad. He  
didn't  
know what to do next, whether to put it all into the oven or on the stove  
(and he didn't know how the stove worked!).  
Suddenly he saw his kitten licking from the bowl of mix and reached to  
push  
her away, knocking the egg carton to the floor. Frantically he tried to  
clean  
up this monumental mess but slipped on the eggs, getting his pajamas white  
and sticky. And just then he saw Dad standing at the door.  
Big crocodile tears welled up in Brandon's eyes. All he'd wanted to do was  
something good, but he'd made a terrible mess. He was sure a  scolding was  
coming, maybe even a spanking. But his father just watched him. Then,  
walking  
through the mess, he picked up his crying son, hugged him and loved him,  
getting his own pajamas white and sticky in the process.  
That's how God deals with us. We try to do something good in life, but it  
turns into a mess. Our marriage gets all sticky or we insult a friend or  
we  
can't stand our job or our health goes sour. Sometimes we just stand there  
in  
tears because we can't think of anything else to do.  
That's when God picks us up and loves us and forgives us, even though some  
of  
our mess gets all over Him. But just because we might mess up, we can't  
stop  
trying to "make pancakes," for God or for others. Sooner or later we'll  
get  
it right, and then they'll be glad we tried...  
Please pass some of this love on to others.......... suppose one morning  
you  
never wake up, do all your friends know you love them? I was  thinking...  
I  
could die today, tomorrow or next week and I wondered if I had any wounds  
needing to be healed, friendships that need rekindling or three words  
needing  
to be said, sometimes, "I love you" can heal & bless. Let everyone of your  
friends know you love them, Even if you think they don't love back, you  
would  
be amazed at what those three  little words and a smile can do. Just in  
case  
I die tomorrow...I  LOVE YA!!!
