1.  BRING A FRIEND SALE

Think back over the vacations you've taken.  The scenery was
fantastic.  The beaches were great.  What you remember best,
though, are the friends you traveled with and the great times
you had together.  Funjet Vacations' Bring a Friend Sale lets
you and a friend share great memories for less!

I remember floating in the Caribbean at sunset, basking in the
warm water with my friends Kate, Brian and Julie.  The next day
we took the boat over to Cozumel.  I can still see their smiling
faces in the sun and spray.  We went snorkeling together, played
volleyball, went shopping...

I remember strolling down the Strip in Las Vegas with my friend
Dan, trying our luck at the casinos, cooling off by the pool,
then going out to dinners and great shows.

I've traveled with lots of different friends at different times
in my life. From Orlando to Cocoa Beach to Miami.  From San Diego
to San Francisco.  From the mountains of Colorado to excitement of
Hollywood and L.A.  And every time I was glad there was someone
to share the moment with me.

Funjet Vacations can take you to all these great places.
Bring a friend, and make your vacation ever more special.
Visit http://www.funjet.com/hotdeals/index.htm today.

Have fun on vacation!

John
Your Friend in Travel at Funjet Vacations
