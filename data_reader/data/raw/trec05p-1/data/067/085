Paul,

We have already finalized Sept. P&L....our deadline was 5 p.m. yesterday.  Therefore, any changes from what was issued yesterday will simply come back to you in a flash adjustment at the end of this month or the following month.  Its possible that price revisions occurred which were not picked up by the download in Enpower.

Thanks.
Casey

Casey,
I reconciled my P&L and I am off from your final P&L number for the month.

I am showing a Profit of ~ $596,000 … however I flowed approx 68,000 MW which would incur a charge of ($136,000).  Therefore my final P&L number should be ~ $460,000.

Your final showed $341,000.

Please give me a call.
