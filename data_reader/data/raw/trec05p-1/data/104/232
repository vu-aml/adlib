Alan,

My sincerest apologies, please keep me posted on what happens.  I'd like to buy you lunch sometime soon and talk about how we can avoid these situations in the future.  I think if we get master documents in place and convey to you a better understanding of our corporate structure, you'll find Enron easy to deal with, flexible, responsive, and competitive.  I'll call you soon in hopes we can get together.

Dave

Thanks.  Roger called and I am now working with Annette now to try to get
things wrapped up.

AT ONCE.

		Roger,

		I hope you're reading your E-mail, because I can't get to
you by phone.

		Our attorney is checking the contract T&Cs, but I noticed
that none of
		the
		corrected company information I provided the last time
around is
		included.
		The name of our company is incorrect.  You have Ralph Mill's
name with
		my
		address, phone number, and my (incorrect) fax number. The
facility name
		is
		incorrect and the street name is misspelled.  All of this
was correct on
		the
		last copy I sent you.  Plus, there is no customer contact
information on
		the
		second page.

		Since the file is protected, I can't even correct this.

		How are we going to get this fixed in the next 2 hours?
