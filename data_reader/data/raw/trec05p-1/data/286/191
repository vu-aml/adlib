Dear Lisa Gang,

Thank you for applying with Digital Signature Trust (DST) for a TrustID business certificate.  As you know by now, your TrustID certificate stands for the highest level of authentication available, allowing you to use the Internet with confidence for your secure online transactions.

We have received your application and have begun the approval process.  (If you are paying for your certificate with a purchase order, please fax us a copy of the order at (801)326-5438 so we can begin the approval process.)

To complete the TrustID Business Agreement, take it to an authorized employee of your organization for signature or have the Authorized Signer send the completed Authorization Agreement to DST using DST's SimpleSign file signing application:

www.TrustDST.com/simplesign/bus-auth.html    

Or you may mail the completed TrustID Business Agreement form to:

U.S. Mail:
Attn: Registration Desk
Digital Signature Trust Co.
P.O. Box 22930							
Salt Lake City, UT 84122-0930

The approval process is normally completed within three business days after receipt of your completed forms.  At that point, we will send you a message indicating our approval of your application and the steps necessary to retrieve your TrustID certificate.  If we are unable to approve your application, we will mail you a letter with an explanation.
