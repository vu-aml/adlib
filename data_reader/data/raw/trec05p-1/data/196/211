Mark,

I've put in another call to Joe to discuss the following.  I'll leave a voicemail on your D.C. phone line if my discussions with Joe raise a significant issue.

Ed,

In my conversations with Andy Edling at NGPL, he indicated to me that NGPL is  unwilling to allow us to permanently release ENA storage contracts to a third party. He is  recommending that we work out a capacity release arrangement with a third party.
