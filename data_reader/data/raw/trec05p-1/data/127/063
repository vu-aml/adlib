Since we were together Tom checked the website for the New Orleans Wine and
Food Experience.  Tom discovered it is now held in May.  The 2002 program is
up and gives all the details. The dates are May 22 - 26, 2002.  If you wish
to check it out here it is: http://www.nowfe.com/ . After you have a chance
to consider it, perhaps we can decide as a group whether we want to take
this on, either in whole or in part.
We will get back to you later on our available dates for January.

Tom and Jerilynn

wonderful
