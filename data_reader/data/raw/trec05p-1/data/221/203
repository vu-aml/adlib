David, we made offers to 4 new grads a few months ago to work for Enron Canada Corp. ECC is obviously going to renege on these offers. Is there any opportunity to have these offers assigned to UBS Warburg Energy. All four of these new grads are outstanding and the timing should be aligned with business ramping up (ie June - Sept timeframe). The estate would be cooperative with assigning the offers and the students are looking for clarity/comfort.
