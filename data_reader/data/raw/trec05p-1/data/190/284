Hi deary

When I repress my emotion my stomach keeps score.
Only so you can appeal to your God and pray Him to support and bless your courage, your work, your perseverance, your strength, your resolution, and with all these, your claim on life
It was a good thing to have a couple of thousand people all rigid and frozen together, in the palm of one's hand.

http://cetaceasd.net/TsubRokXaF02DftOcAurrcVJN/BBAbMAsAJwcLTA0y.htm

For what avail the plough or sail, Or land or life, if freedom fail ?
I have no fear of photography as long as it cannot be used in heaven and in hell.
Everything comes if a man will only wait.The great secret of succeeding in conversation is to admire little, to hear much; always to distrust our own reason, and sometimes that of our friends; never to pretend to wit, but to make that of others appear as much as possibly we can; to hearken to what is said and to answer to the purpose.
Love is not something we do, love is something we are.

Adye
