I was checking my email and saw this advertisement in it. just like you I was thinking this stuff will not work its all a gimmic.. but even with my other half telling me im wasting my money I went ahead and purchased it. and I can tell you right now with a straight face im bigger than I have ever been in my life in just 2 weeks my girth and length were outstanding I could easily become a porn star now hehe :)

In anycase I promised the company I would tell everyone I know about this amazing solution and I am going to do just that.
