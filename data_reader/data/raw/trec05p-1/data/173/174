Sally ...
I thought I would pass this on. 

It started with some unidentified boxes which Shirley Birch was trying to locate.  I do not think Carolyn Gilley is here any longer.

This definitley does not sound like HPL.  I will ask around and see if anyone knows anything.  

However, there are about 1,400 boxes that do relate to HPL in a couple of conference rooms over at 3AC.  They need to go to AEP.  In additon there are approxiamately 12,000 boxes that relate to HPL at Iron Mountain that belong to AEP, however many of these boxes also contained other non-HPL information that needs to be removed prior to AEP taking possesion of them.  Carolyn Gilley had a contracter working on reviewing the contents of these boxes and removing the non-HPL stuff.  AEP is in the process sending a demand letter to us asking for these boxes as they have upcoming tax audits and other needs for the boxes.  Who can work on this for us?  AEP is willing to fund a team of contractors to complete this.

	jim,

	thanks so much for taking the time to reply.   the boxes were sent to bert stromquist from linda lyrock (EGEP, Inc.).  	i am not sure about the labeling of the boxes (HPL).  the boxes contain technical data for expl & prod for 	international areas.  

	bert was with enron global markets.  any ideas regarding these records will be helpful.

	thanks,

No.  We did have HPL boxes over that at one time and Carolyn Gilley and Earl Johnson managed the process but both are no longer here.  Can we get more specific information as to the contents and whether they are labled as HPL or not?
