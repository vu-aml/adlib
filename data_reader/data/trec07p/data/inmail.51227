ajanp writes "Computerworld discusses the [0]defeat of pro-ODF
legislation in the states of [1]California, [2]Florida, [3]Texas,
[4]Oregon, and [5]Connecticut which 'would have required state agencies
to use freely available and interoperable file formats, such as the Open
Document Format for Office Applications, instead of Microsoft Corp.'s
proprietary Office formats.' A similar bill in [6]Minnesota was changed
to study the issue instead. There was heavy lobbying being done in
private on both sides with one problem being 'the jargon-laden
disinformation that committee members felt they were being fed by
lobbyists for both IBM and Microsoft. Although lobbyists would tell the
committee one thing in private, they got cold feet when asked to verify
the information publicly, under oath.' However, 'Despite the string of
defeats, Marino Marcich, executive director of the Washington-based ODF
Alliance, said the legislative fight has only begun.'"

[0]chessweb writes "Here is a rather enlightening article by Richard
Stallman on the [1]reasons for moving to GPLv3 that puts the previous
[2]TiVo post into the right context." From the article: "One major danger
that GPLv3 will block is tivoization. Tivoization means computers (called
'appliances') contain GPL-covered software that you can't change, because
the appliance shuts down if it detects modified software... The
manufacturers of these computers take advantage of the freedom that free
software provides, but they don't let you do likewise... GPLv3 ensures
you are free to remove the handcuffs. It doesn't forbid DRM, or any kind
of feature. It places no limits on the substantive functionality you can
add to a program, or remove from it. Rather, it makes sure that you are
just as free to remove nasty features as the distributor of your copy was
to add them."

lead to tools that help repressive regimes identify anonymous dissidents,
the [2]Reporters Without Borders advocacy group warned last Friday.
Microsoft's new algorithms correctly guessed the gender of a Web surfer
80% of the time, and his or her age 60% of the time. "In China, it is
conceivable that this type of technology would be used to spot Internet
users who regularly access such 'subversive' content as news and
information websites critical of the regime," the group said."

breakthrough may bring scientists one step closer to a [0]Star Trek style
transporter. " A team of physicists has teleported data over a distance
of 89 miles from the Canary Island of La Palma to the neighbouring island
of Tenerife, which is 10 times further than the previous attempt at
teleportation through free space. The scientists did it by exploiting the
"spooky" and virtually unfathomable field of quantum entanglement - when
the state of matter rather than matter itself is sent from one place to
another. Tiny packets or particles of light, photons, were used to
teleport information between telescopes on the two islands. The photons
did it by quantum entanglement and scientists hope it will form the basis
of a way of sending encrypted data."

[1]Emacs 22 has been released and includes a bunch of updates and some
new modes as well. In addition to support for GTK+ and a graphical
interface to the GNU Debugger, 'this release includes build support for
Linux on AMD64, S/390, and Tensilica Xtensa machines, FreeBSD/Alpha,
Cygwin, Mac OS X, and Mac OS 9 with Carbon support. The Leim package is
now part of GNU Emacs, so users will be able to get input support for
Chinese, Tibetan, Vietnamese, Thai, Korean, and other languages without
downloading a separate package. New translations of the Emacs tutorial
are also available in Brasilian Portuguese, Bulgarian, simplified and
traditional Chinese, Italian, French, and Russian.'"

[0]Science data nerds writes "The White House is consistently and
persistently [1] claiming that the US is doing better than Europe in
reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This is false — their claim is purely
based on carefully selecting the only subset of the data that supports
this conclusion. When all the data are used, it is plain that European
emissions have declined substantially and US emissions have grown
substantially. The article, and [2]this linked analysis, debunk the White
House claims."
