FERC Agenda Highlights
March 31, 2002, Meeting

The agenda is available at http://www.ferc.fed.us/public/isd/sunshine.htm

____________________________________________________________

The following items of interest to NNG are on the agenda for the March 13,
2002, FERC Sunshine meeting:

                                 NNG Items

         There are no NNG proceedings on the agenda at this time.


                           Administrative Items

A-1: Agency Administrative Matters, Docket AD02-1

A-2: Customer Matters, Reliability, Security and Market Operations, Docket
AD02-7

A-3:  California Infrastructure Update, AD01-3-000

A-4: Northeast RTO Update, AD02-12 (with numerous N.E. RTO subdockets)


                                 Gas Items


G-1:  El Paso Natural Gas Co., RP00-336-002 [ONEOK Energy Marketing &
Trade, EP00-139-000; Aera Energy, RP01-484-000; Apache Nitrogen Products,
RP01-486-000]:  This proceeding centers on issues of capacity allocation
and constraints on El Paso's pipeline system and the differing solutions
offered by EOC (east of California) FR (full requirements) and CD (contract
demand) shippers.

G-9:  Sea Robin Pipeline, CP95-168-006:  Following the Commission's Order
on Remand establishing separate transportation and gathering offshore
systems, Sea Robin filed separately stated rates for both the
jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional systems.  The rates were protested;
parties have filed a settlement which is supported by Staff and has been
certified to the Commission by the ALJ.  This should be an order on the
settlement.

G-12:  ANR Pipeline, RP01-612-001/000:  ANR filed revised tariff sheets to
enable it to use a proposed pro forma Associated Liquefiables Agreement to
apply to situations which include PCR (hydrocarbons in a liquid state which
condense out of the transporter's facilities) and Flash Gas (gaseous
hydrocarbons that either vaporize or are from liquefied hydrocarbons), in
addition to PTR (Dekatherms removed at a processing plant).   Indicated
Shippers filed a protest concerning the imbalance procedures that ANR
proposes to implement with the pro forma agreement.  A technical conference
was held on the issues and ANR made a subsequent compliance filing.

C-4: Cove Point LNG, CP01-76-001 et al.:  In its December 19, 2001, Order
on Rehearing, the  Commission established a hearing to address the limited
issue of Cove Point's rates for its existing service to Washington Gas,
which is not a signatory party to the settlement in this proceeding.

C-7: Policy on Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity for Gas
Transmission Facilities in the Off-shore Louisiana Area:  There's no record
of this proceeding in any of the FERC information systems.

G-14: Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission, RP98-53-024/015/021/023:
On January 24, 2002, KM filed an Offer of Settlement designed to: (1)
extinguish the liability of all working interest owners whose aggregate
total liability (principle and interest) as of September 30, 2001 is
$80,000 or less; (2) establish the liabilities of the remaining 30 working
interest owners, and then reduce such liabilities by the greater of $80,000
or 25%; and (3) extinguish the liability of royalty owners to working
interest owners participating in the settlement for refunds of ad valorem
taxes, due to the Commission's implementation of the decision of the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Public
Service Company of Colorado.

                           Order 637 Proceedings

G-15:  Gulf South Pipeline Co., RP00-340 et al.:  This is Gulf South's
Order 637 proceeding in which the pipeline filed a settlement with FERC
that reflects disagreement over the ability for the pipeline to offer
segmentation.  According to Gulf South, it has filed operational evidence
of the reticulated nature of the pipeline system.  In light of this
evidence and subsequent settlement discussions, Gulf South remains adamant
that "Traditional Segmentation" as contemplated in order 637 is not
operationally feasible on its system.  Instead, Gulf South has proposed a
segmentation plan utilizing four virtual points.  Further, Gulf South
asserts that its discount policy, which excludes IT, satisfies FERC's
policy goals as enunciated in CIG and Granite State.

G-4: Black Marlin Pipeline, RP00-335, RP01-414
G-5: Egan Hub Partners, RP00-341, RP01-48
G-6: Enbridge Pipelines (AlaTenn), RP00-401, RP01-4
G-7: Enbridge Pipelines (Midla), RP00-400, RP01-5
G-16: Western Gas Interstate, RP00-461

                              Electric Items

E-1:  Standard Market Design Scoping, RM01-12-000

E-38:  State-Federal Regional RTO Panels, RT02-2-001:  Included in this
4-page long agenda item are over 50 proceeding involving RTO proceedings,
OASIS and the Ex-Parte rules.
