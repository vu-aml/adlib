>   True Story:
>        In a supermarket, Kurtis the stock boy, was
> busily working when a new voice
>        came over the asking for a carryout at check
> register 4.
>
>        As he approached the check-out stand, a smile
> caught his eye; the new check
>        out girl was beautiful. She was an older
> woman (maybe 26; he was only
>        22).
>
>
>        Later that day, after his shift was over, he
> waited by the punch clock to
>        find out her name. She came into the break
> room, smiled softly at him, took
>        her card and punched out, then left. He
> looked at her card:  Brenda.
>
>        Next day, he waited outside as she left the
> supermarket, and offered her a
>        ride home. He looked harmless enough, and she
> accepted. When he  dropped her
>        off, he asked if maybe he could see her
> again, outside of work. She simply
>        said it wasn't possible. He pressed and she
> explained she had two children
>        and she couldn't afford a baby-sitter.  He
> offered to pay for the
>        baby-sitter. Reluctantly she accepted his
> offer for a date the following
>        Saturday.
>
>        That Saturday night he arrived at her door
> only to have her tell him that
>        she was unable to go with him. The
> baby-sitter had called and canceled. To
>        which Kurtis simply said, "Well, lets take
> the kids with us."
>
>        She tried to explain that taking the children
> was not an option, but he
>        wouldn't take 'no' for an answer.  Finally,
> Brenda, brought him inside to
>        meet her children. She had a cute older
> daughter.  Then Brenda brought out
>        her son, in a wheelchair.  He was born a
> paraplegic, with Down syndrome.
>        Kurtis told Brenda, "I still don't understand
> why the kids can't come with
>        us."
>
>        Brenda was amazed. Most men would run away
> from a woman with two kids,
>        especially if one was  disabled.  Her prior
> husband, the father of the kids,
>        had done that.
>
>        That evening Kurtis and Brenda loaded up the
> kids and went to dinner and the
>        movies.  When her son needed anything, Kurtis
> took care of him. When he
>        needed to use the rest room, Kurtis picked
> him up out of his chair . The
>        kids loved Kurtis. At the end of the evening,
> Brenda knew this was the man
>        she was going to marry and spend the rest of
> her life with.
>
>        A year later, they were married and Kurtis
> adopted both of her children.
>        Since then they have added two more kids.
>
>        So what happened to the stock boy and check
> out girl?
>
>        Mr. & Mrs. Kurt Warner now live in St. Louis,
> where he plays quarterback for
>        the St. Louis Rams.  Kurt won the NFL MVP
> award this year.
