Latest NFL Player News

Ricky Watters <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1151&>, RB SEA - McKay Updated 10/23/01
According to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again." If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.

Trent Dilfer <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantas! y ! perspective, so don't use him this week.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Tomaski Updated 10/23/01
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Dedric Ward <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.

Lamar Smith <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&! ra! ndom=73&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.

Marvin Minnis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.

Jerome Pathon <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=12612&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.

Terrence Wilkins <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.

Terrell Davis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. He wi! ll! work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1171&>, RB TB - TexOK Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. 

Duce Staley <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1757&>, RB PHI - TayDang Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries late in the ga! me! . At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Joe Nedney <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1389&>, K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week. 

Erron Kinney <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=12342&>, WR TEN - Pink Panthers Updated 10/23/01
Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Fear Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game. 

Steve McNair <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1069&>, QB TEN - McKay Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=pl! ay! ers&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction," head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. "It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week." Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap <http://football210.fanta! sy! .sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=235215&> , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1035&>, QB BAL - TexOK Updated 10/23! /0! 1
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. "I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area," Grbac said Monday. "There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see." Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=12411&>, WR STL - Metz Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans. 

Trung! C! anidate <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=187503&>, RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. "I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game," coach Mike Martz said. "He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play." Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1292&>, WR SF - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. "Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was able to get treatment every day,"! S! tokes told the Contra Costa Times . "I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close." Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Pink Panthers Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1109&>, RB STL - Grigsby Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. "I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago," Martz said. "I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play." Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.
