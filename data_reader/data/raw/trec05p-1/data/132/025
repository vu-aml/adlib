Hi Again Monika -
 
Here is what I heard from my former professor. If I were you, I would
contact Eric Hughson about CU's PhD program in Finance. It is worth a
try.
 
I will contact you if I hear about other opportunities either for
graduate study or employment opportunities. Keep me posted.
 
Jim

Hi Jim,
It has been a long time between communications.  We no longer offer an
MS in Finance (however, I believe the Denver Campus does).  We admit
only one or two new students in the Finance PhD Program each year--thus
it is very competitive.  Our Finance PhD Program coordinator is Eric
Hughson and he could be contacted at Eric.Hughson@Colorado.EDU.
Unfortunately, I don't have any specific recommendations.
Ron
PS--I also still like the teaching part of the academic life and
probably won't be retiring for another few years.

	Hi Ron - 

	It certainly has been a long time since we have communicated. I
am glad to see that you have not yet retired and either have I.
Moreover, I don't have any plans to do so in the immediate future as
this job is so much fun.

	The reason I am writing is that a former student of mine from
Albania who works for Enron has been thinking for some time that she
would like to go back to school and get a Master's Degree in Finance or
PhD. Being a foreign student she needs to get some sort of scholarship
or assistantship. She graduated from OSU a year or so ago and has been
working at Enron since that time. Given what is happening at Enron, I am
not surprised that she has decided to go back for a graduate degree.

	Our College of Business does not have any graduate student
assistantships and we also don't offer a master degree in finance or
PhD.  Monika is without a doubt one of the sharpest students I have had
in recent years. She is incredibly bright and works very hard. 

	Does CU still offer the masters degree in finance and still
offer student assistantships. If I recall, George Carvel was working on
a MS in Finance and had an assistantship under Maurice Unger when I was
going to CU. If so, can I give Monika your name and have her contact and
perhaps forward her resume to you. Or can you put her in touch with the
right person at CU?

	If CU does not have anything available do you know of a few
schools who might so that I can pass the information on to Monika?

	Thanks for any help you can provide. 

	Best regards, 

	Jim
