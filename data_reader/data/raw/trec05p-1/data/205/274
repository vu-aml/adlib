Hi Gaye Lynn--
	Bruce said you might have an interest in looking at this resume.  David Junus worked for me in business development before we had to let him go.  He has very good financial model analytical skills and previous to the pipeline worked in risk management for EES.  

pls call me if you have questions.

thanks
