Please accept this e-mail as my one-week notice of termination of my position at Enron.  I have accepted a position at another company.  In discussions with Steve Van Hooser it was agreed that one week would be sufficient notice for the termination of my position.

I appreciate all the courtesies extended to me during my employment at Enron.  I have enjoyed working here and I appreciate your understanding with regard to my termination.  

Sincerely,

Rae Meadows
