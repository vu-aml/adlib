Deer All,
attached is the 2001 game log (to date) keith is heading out during the 
doe/spike season. i'll need him to update me when he returns so i can get 
the info to mertz.

Looks like we had a solid year. Congrats to Joe on his 9, Keith on his drop 
thing, Brian on acutually shooting not one, but two deer. Both were solid 
bucks. Congrats to Chris on going at all which was in question after 
incident last spring and pregnant wife. Thanks to the McComb boys for their 
incredible addition to the trailer...the kegarator. It inspired us all 
season long (and it is empty again).

Rent goes up this year and it is due a month earlier now, March and August. 
It will be $2k a gun for 8 members. Chet will probably not be taking this 
spot. I would like to know if the McCombs would like to fill that spot for 
use by J.T. and/or Anne Marie and/or Tyler in some form or fashion that 
works for all. Let's talk. I would like to avoid adding someone "new" to the 
lease that would have their own group/family they would want to take as 
guests.

Mertz stopped by on sunday. very friedly, thanked us for our business and 
and hauled our trash off the lease for us....I'm not kidding. Guess he is 
really looking forward to the rent increase.

Late season Doe and Spike slayers:

There are 7.5 bags of corn left in the barn. Feeder status is as follows:
Hole empty and i have unhooked the battery.
booger working half full, protien
Lonestar working and half full
3030 empty and motor returned to trailer
mesquite flat empty, but protien in feeder, i disconnected the corn battery.
gray box near bottom of barrel, but still feeding. we did not hunt their
showtime working and half full, protien
hideout: did not check, probably empty.
pig stand working 1/3 full, protien , not hunted
boneyard working (slow and weak spin) half full.

There is a spike(s) in the mesquite flat. may want to corn the road and see 
if he shows, if not, good place to take a doe.

Boneyard/Pig stand had a spike with bladed type antlers earlier in the year 
and we could stand to take another doe from that pasture

Lonestar could give up a doe

booger has a few does around it. i saw six. there are two prime zoo 
canditates there. the first is an old bag that has carmel coolered hide on 
her stomache/mid section. her shoulders and butt are normal tan. the other 
is an old doe with unique white/gray patches of hair on her back near the 
tail. Looks like fur missing until you look closer.
WARNING:
BEER ALL GONE.

Next spring we can set up a work weekend to move the pig stand blind to the 
boneyard location and build a new big box to set up near the windmill in the 
half section. I also vote to remove 3030. It was not hunted much, and I 
think is splits the deer up between booger/hole and lonestar. I vote to use 
the tripod to set up at hot spots and move the feeder to double up at 
lonestar.

e.
