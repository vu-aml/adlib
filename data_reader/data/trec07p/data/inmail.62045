[0]mytrip writes "2007 has not been kind to AMD, but it's surprising to
hear rumours that [1]they might be considering outsourcing chip
fabrication. Analysts are predicting that AMD will try to cut costs by
moving some fabrication elements out of the company by early next year.
'One Citigroup analyst is predicting a "transformational move" that would
result in AMD's lower-end CPUs being manufactured by a third party and
possibly selling off part or all of its Dresden, Germany facility.
Another report from Goldman Sachs outlines the investment firm's belief
that the company will leave manufacturing completely in the hands of
third parties.'"

[0]slugo writes with a CNN article about young professionals increasingly
aware of the small part of the internet they're allowed to play in.
Intelligent and internet-savvy, these users are [1]frustrated by China's
overactive concern for internet health. "Yang Zhou is no cyberdissident,
but recent curbs on his Web surfing habits by China's censors have him
fomenting discontent ... Yang's fury erupted a few days ago when he found
he could not browse his friend's holiday snaps on Flickr.com, due to
access restrictions by censors after images of the 1989 Tiananmen Square
massacre were posted on the photo-sharing Web site. "Once you've
complained all you can to your friends, what more can you do? What else
is there but anger and disillusionment?" Yang said after venting his
anger with friends at a hot-pot restaurant in Beijing. The blocking of
Flickr is the latest casualty of China's ongoing battle to control its
sprawling Internet. Wikipedia and a raft of other popular Web sites,
discussion boards and blogs have already fallen victim to the country's
censors."

[0]WSJdpatton writes "iPhones can be used for email, but many businesses
[1]don't plan to sync them with internal systems used to power
Blackberries and Microsoft mobile devices. Employees eager to use the
cool new gadget, however, may pressure IT departments to support iPhones
even if it means incurring more costs and changing policies. The WSJ
reports: 'Incompatible technology has become an increasing problem for
businesses as hand-held email and phone devices are evolving into
minicomputers that can do such things as download music, take pictures
and surf the Web. In the past, businesses have been unwilling to support
certain devices, like those with cameras, for instance, because of
concerns employees could use them to document company secrets. But these
tensions would be magnified if the iPhone is as popular as Apple is
hoping and some analysts expect.'"

[0]SlinkySausage writes "Microsoft has admitted, in an email to the
press, that 'some customers may be waiting to adopt Windows Vista because
they've heard rumors about device or application compatibility issues, or
because they think they should wait for a service pack release.' The
company is now [1]pleading with customers not to wait until the release
of SP1 at the end of the year, launching a 'fact rich' program to try to
convince them to 'proceed with confidence'. The announcement coincides
with an embarrassing double-backflip: Microsoft had pre-briefed
journalists that it was going to allow home users to run Vista basic and
premium under virtual machines like VMWare, but it changed its mind at
the last minute and [2]pulled the announcement."

An anonymous reader writes "[0]I had a surreal experience with Dell
today. My boss asked me to order a new computer for our small, non-profit
business. Wanting to support Dell in their decision to sell computers
with Ubuntu installed, I decided to order one. First, I talked to a small
business representative, who informed me that I could not order one of
the Ubuntu-based computers through the small business department. I had
to go through the "home and home office" department. I called the Home
office department. I asked the representative if I could buy one of the
ubuntu computers for my company. She said (and I quote), "these Dell
computers are designed for personal use only, as long as you use it for
personal use, you can purchase one." So I lied and said I would.... Next,
I tried to buy it on our business credit card. They would have none of
that. She told me that I had to buy it through a personal card. Now, as a
non-profit, our business does not pay sales tax (10% in Tennessee). Had I
bought it with my own card, I would have had to pay tax (~$90), which my
company would not have reimbursed me for. So.....no Dell today."

[0]Banekartr writes "The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency plans
to develop [1]a fleet of robots that soldiers can deploy in urban combat
settings as they move through houses and along streets. The program,
dubbed LANdroid, envisions miniature autonomous drones that can form a
network capable of relaying radio traffic in a setting often considered
challenging for communications equipment. According to a notional image
of a [2]LANdroid included in a DARPA pamphlet, each robot will be about
the size of a deck of cards, and must be rugged, lightweight and able to
operate for seven to 14 days, the agency said. Demand for technologies to
improve the military's ability to fight in urban settings has increased
in recent years because many of the operations in Iraq take place in
Baghdad and other Iraqi metropolitan settings. DARPA officials will
provide additional information about the program during a July 6 industry
day."

In the wake of yesterday's announcement of [0]a UK ban on Manhunt 2 ,
Rockstar has registered its [1]disappointment at the BBFC's decision. The
company simply stated that they 'respect those who have different
opinions about the horror genre and videogames as a whole, but we hope
they will also consider the opinions of the adult gamers for whom this
product is intended.' Meanwhile, here in the US, the ESRB has [2]given
the game the dreaded AO rating, for adults only. If you're unfamiliar
with this seldom-seen designation, it's essentially the 'kiss of death'
for a title at retail; a number of popular videogame outlets refuse to
carry titles with that rating. MTV's Stephen Totilo has a lengthy and
considered [3]discussion of these proceedings. "For 'Manhunt 2,' signs
pointed to the title being both less and more extreme than the first.
Gone from press previews were mentions of snuff films and Directors.
Instead, a more traditionally violent video game premise: one man's
struggle to stay alive in an insane asylum gone mad."

We have another essay from [0]Bennett Haselton for you to peruse. "Last
week's coverage of AT&T's newly announced [1]"anti-piracy initiative"
mostly downplayed the key part of AT&T's proposal, which is filtering
what their end users can access in the first place, not finding pirates
or suing them after the fact. Friday's Associated Press article, which
was [2]reprinted on many news sites with headlines like "AT&T to Help
Hollywood Track Down Internet Pirates" and "AT&T to ID Offshore Web
Pirates", actually said only that "the effort is primarily aimed at
pirates who set up operations in other countries" -- and since you can't
really "aim" at pirates in Russia and China with anything except
missiles, the statement suggests not identifying pirates or tracking them
down, but pre-emptively blocking people from connecting to their servers.
Only the Red Herring nailed it with their article title, [3]"AT&T to
Block Pirated Content"." Follow the magical URL to read the rest of
Bennett's words on the matter.

QuijiboIsAWord writes "Zap2It Labs, which provides free TV listing data
for personal use, has long been the main source of program guide
information for users in the US and beyond. They've announced via their
webpage that, due to abuse of the service, data will [0]no longer be
available after September 1st. There is no other direct source, and no
option to pay for the service even if the users wanted to. Without a data
feed of this type, users will be reduced to scraping websites at best. Is
this going to be a killing blow for MythTV?"

the last 10 years working tirelessly on behalf of limited copyright

[0]fighting the good fight against corruption and the influence of big

| Black Hole Information Loss Paradox Solution Proposed              |

[0]Anuborn Satirak writes to tell us that Physicists from Case Western
Reserve University claim to have [1]cracked the black hole information
loss paradox that has puzzled physicists for the past 40 years. "The
physicists are quick to assure astronomers and astrophysicists that what
is observed in gravity pulling masses together still holds true, but what
is controversial about the new finding is that 'from an external viewer's
point it takes an infinite amount of time to form an event horizon and
that the clock for the objects falling into the black hole appears to
slow down to zero,' said Krauss, director of Case's Center for Education
and Research in Cosmology."

| USAF Developing New "SR-72" Supersonic Spy?                        |

[0]Kadin2048 writes "According to an Air Force Times article, the famed
Lockheed Martin 'Skunk Works' may be hard at work on a [1]new supersonic
spy plane (with 'artist concept') for the U.S. military, to replace the
SR-71 'Blackbird' retired a decade ago. Dubbed by some the SR-72, the jet
would be unmanned and travel at about 4,000 MPH at as much as 100,000
feet, with 'transcontinental' range. Some have speculated that new
high-speed spy planes could be a U.S. response to anti-satellite weapons
deployed by China, in order to preserve reconnaissance capabilities in
the event of a loss of satellite coverage. Neither the Air Force nor
Lockheed Martin would comment on the program, or lack thereof."

releases the first installment of their [0]CLARAty reusable robotic
software framework to the public. According to the JPL press release,
these modules contain everything from math infrastructure to device
drivers for common motors and cameras, and computer vision, image, and 3D
processing."
