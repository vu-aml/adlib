I know why your name is Service "Magic" - you are just that!
Tina L. - Denver, CO

Your service is great. I had been asking my husband to find someone to fix our fence for months. I told him that we should contact ServiceMagic and in two days we had someone to do the job and in three days it was complete. What a relief. You have a permanent customer with us. Thanks again.
Deborah F. - Cerritos, CA

I am so happy to have found you! I am a single mom, I live on a corner lot, and every year I seem to be able to only invest in small projects. I am excited to save time - I won't have to use the phone book anymore! Again, your site has become my knight in shining armor. Thank you.
Terri T. - Ogden, Utah

We look forward to working for you,
