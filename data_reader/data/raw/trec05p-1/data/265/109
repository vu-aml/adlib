  Human societies have known about its healing and health effects for <br>
  thousands of years. Way back in the day, Aloe Vera was very expensive.
<br>
  Today, it? within everyone? reach. Aloe Vera can be used to treat a <br>
  very large number of ailments. It promotes health and well-being and it
<br>
  increases your body? supply of antioxidants.<br>
  <br>
  Next time I?l tell you how to use it to improve digestion, among other
<br>
  things.<br>
  <br>
  Before I go, I? like to leave you with this inspirational quote by <br>
  Oliver Wendell Holmes:<br>
  <br>
  ?o reach a port we must sail, sometimes with the wind and sometimes<br>
  against it. But we must not drift or lie at anchor.?br><br><br>
  <br>
  See you next time,<br>
