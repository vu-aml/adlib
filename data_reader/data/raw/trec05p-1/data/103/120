Dear beloved, 

I am Mohammed Abacha, the son of the Late Gen. Sanni Abacha former Nigerian Military Head of State who died mysteriously as a result of Cardiac Arrest. Since after my fathers death my family is under restriction of movement and that not withstanding, we are being molested, policed and our Bank Account both here and abroad are being frozen by the Nigerian Civilian Government. Following the recent discovery of my fathers Bank Account by the Nigerian Government with Swiss Bank in which the huge sum of US$700 MILLION and DM 450 Million was logged.

I therefore decided to contact you in confidence that I was able to move out the sum of US$25 Million Dollars, which was secretly defaced and is sealed in two Metal Boxes for security reasons. I therefore personally, appeal to you seriously and religiously for your urgent assistance to move this money into your country where I believe it will
be safe since I cannot leave the country due to the restriction of movement imposed on the members of my family by the Nigerian government

You can contact me through my email due to security reasons and if need be, telephone conversation the Securty Company Lawyer will speak with you. And the Lawyer shall arrange with you for face to face meeting outside Nigeria in order to liaise with you towards effective completion / claim of this fund. 

However, arrangements have been put in place to move this money out of the country in a secret vault through a diplomatic security company here in Nigeria, and as soon as you indicate your interest, i will direct you to the Security Company Lawyer for more details on this issue.

If you are interested then you send to me your telephone/fax number, your postal address and a copy of international passport for identification purpose. All documentation will procured by the Security Company Lawyer on your name. Conclusively, I have agreed to offer you 30% of the total sum while 70% is to be held on trust by you until we can decide on a suitable business investment in your country subsequent to our free movement by the Nigerian Government. 

Please reply urgently and treat with absolute confidentiality and sincerety.

Best Regards. 

Mohammed Abacha.
