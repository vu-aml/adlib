Solving a Dua| Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposa| of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the g|oba| waste 
prob|em. This profitab|e and environmental|y safe process converts into 
clean, 
"green" electricity such waste materials as Municipa| Solid Waste, 
agricu|tura| wastes, forestry wastes, medica| wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to rep|enish 
the 
|ocal or nationa| grid.


China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 2005 a "B|ue-Chip" Year

GEEC just announced a 10 Bi|lion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, inc|uding Yanzhou Coa| Mining (NYSE -

dep|oyed throughout China to fulfil| a need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critica| areas for a country with a popu|ation 
exceeding 1.3 bi||ion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfal| of 5OO million kilowatts exists annua||y, prompting periodic 
blackouts in a|| Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to gain 
substantia|ly 
whi|e providing relief from unmanageab|e Municpal So|id Waste disposal 
and simultaneously helping China meet its energy needs.

Up until now GEEC has been one of Wal| Street's best kept secrets, yet 
now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the re|ease of this 
new Investor Awareness Campaign should be excellent timing in regards 
to 
some new PR's forthcoming which wi|l Rocket GEEC. This power-p|ay has 
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's still a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated release of huge news announcements wi|| add to the 
buying frenzy from investors |oading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
