Stacey-

I know that I left you a voice mail on this, but just to keep Kristin in the loop as well.

After our conversation this morning, I talked to Paul Bromley again.  He has asked that you keep in the loop as to your interview schedule so that he may coordinate with his team and Andersen as to attending the interviews.

Again, thanks for doing this for us!  I know that you all are busy.  Thanks,

Christy
