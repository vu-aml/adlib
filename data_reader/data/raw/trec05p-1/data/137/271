About Your FREE Seminar:

History has shown that 85% of money managers don't beat 
the S&P 500 (their benchmark for success). So why blindly 
follow an investment "guru", or buy from a list of "Hot"

can get the KNOWLEDGE and INFORMATION you need to make 
your OWN investment decisions and TAKE CONTROL of your 
investing.

During the FREE 90-minute seminar, you'll review the 
information needed to understand the inner workings of 
Wall Street and effectively manage your investments. No 
get-rick quick techniques, just smart and practical

  little time as possible to do the maximum research.

* You'll access powerful web-based investment TOOLS to find  
  investments that are appropriate for your own personal 
  objectives and your own personal tolerance for risk.

* You'll uncover new STRATEGIES to make better investment 
  decisions, and avoid the most common investing mistakes. 

With BusinessWeek Investor Workshops' simple 5-STEP INVESTING 
FORMULA, you'll see how to invest responsibly and build 
up your portfolio for early retirement.

* How to use a combination of technical analysis and 
  indicators to TIME your entry
