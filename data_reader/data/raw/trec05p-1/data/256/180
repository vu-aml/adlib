Thanks for your reply Cheryl.

Could you both clarify something for me. 

We use the termination log as the basis for terminating our physical and financial deals.  Now, if the log shows the counterparty as terminating the ISDA - do we terminate only financial deals?  Does this mean physical deals, unless specified in the log, remain as live deals?

We're just a bit confused as to how we should be using the log to terminate deals.

Thanks,
Shifali

I think that the termination on Dec. 14th may have been a termination of the GSP - ENA financial ISDA, not the physical deal.

Cheryl,

We have a physical recyled paper deal (YM6441.1) with Garden State that was done on 02 February, 2002.  

The Termination log that Stephanie Panus sends us shows the termination date for Garden State as 14 December, 2001.  Does this mean that this particular deal is valid and do we keep it on the books as a live deal?

Thanks,
Shifali
