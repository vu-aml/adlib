Greg,

I will make that change.  Could you ask Mark Taylor to go ahead and approve it in the system?  He will do it once you give him the go ahead.

Thanks,

Melba, I do not have "Test Applications" in my Start/Programs menu.  My only comment is that I would clarify the delivery point as Empress, Alberta rather than simply Empress.  Otherwise, the product descriptions look fine.
