Sorry I  couldn't get this out to you yesterday, but I'm  sure all of us
feel the same way.  I don't know how long it will be before I can think much
about anything except what  happened yesterday morning, and I haven't heard
yet whether there will  be any NFL games this Sunday.  As you can see from
the attached sheets, Nancy came in first, Mike and Lisa second, and Helmet
and  Kent tied for third.  Kent is our first  rookie winner.  Three people
didn't make it past the first week for LPS--Donna, Prentice and the Shea's.
Assuming there will be a sixteen game season, the new payouts (we have 26
this season instead of 25) will be 1st: $70; 2nd: $55; 3rd: $35 and 4th:
$20.  We'll have to adjust if a week is eliminated from the schedule.
Thanks a lot  for getting those picks in on time and using the form we sent
out.

The three files being sent are (1) Pick Sheet for  Week 2; (2) Week 1 Final
(points and ranking) and (3) Last Person Standing--Week 1.

Eldon
