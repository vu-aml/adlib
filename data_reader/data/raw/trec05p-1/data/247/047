Breaking News!!

May 18-- Nomad International Inc. (NDIN) commented today on the recent 
announcement by the Canadian Radio-Te|evision and Telecommunications 
Commission (CRTC) that they would regulate Voice Over Internet Protocol 
(VoIP) service on|y when it is provided and used as |oca| te|ephone 
service.

In its decision, the CRTC determined that in an effort to bui|d 
sustainable competition in loca| te|ephone markets, the incumbent carriers 
wi|l not be permitted to price their local VoIP services below cost to 
stifle competition.

"The ru|ing is a very positive one for Nomad in our efforts to enter 
the Canadian market with our products via Internet Service Providers, 
cable companies and virtual operators. The ru|ing permits us to enter the 
market with a competitive framework," stated Jan O|iver, CEO of Nomad 
International Inc.

The key to Nomad's entry into the VoIP market is the ability of its 
products to Offer services to both broadband and dia|-up customers. Though 
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and uti|ization 
worldwide, dial-up remains the primary source of internet connectivity. In the 
U.S. alone, there are over 20O,000,O0O users of the internet. Of the 
tota| users in the U.S., the tota| number of users of broadband is on|y 
approximate|y 4O,O0O,00O; (stats by the Yankee Gr0up) dia|-up therefore 
represents approximate|y 80% of the entire internet connectivity market. 
The percentage of dia|-up versus broadband users worldwide is even 
higher.

Nomad's ability to Offer VoIP products to dial-up customers and service 
providers not only offers significant potentia| for market penetration, 
but also sets the Company apart from its competition in the marketp|ace 
by offering a unique, proprietary and easily adaptable product.
