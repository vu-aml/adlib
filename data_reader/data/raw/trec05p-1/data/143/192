John, Rob and I are Directors of Enron Canada Corp. and Enron Canada Power Corp., and as such have independent duties to ensure that decisions are taken in the best interests of Enron Canada, considering all the circumstances.  This may include the interests of its shareholder and the cross-default consequences for Enron Canada if Enron Corp. defaults.  But in the circumstances it may also include preserving value within Enron Canada for Enron Canada's creditors.  To discharge this duty (and to avoid personal liability), we need to be consulted and agree that taking funds out of Enron Canada is the proper decision for Enron Canada in all the circumstances.

Peter.
