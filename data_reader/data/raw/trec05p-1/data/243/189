Dear Sir,

I know that my message will come to you as a surprice
since I dont know you in person or met with you
before,but Iam of the belive that you would be obliged
to come to my assistance after hearing about my
situation.
I was, until recently, a Medical student of the
University of Abidjan, Ivory Coast West Africa. 

Late last year october 2003, the Rebels in my Country
Struck our township and killed my parents and my only
sister in one of their attacks. My late Father, Robert Guei
Molanga being the former president of my country was
a prime Target. Fortunately for me, I was in school
when the attack took place.

Before his death he had a foreign account here in C=F4te
d'Ivoire up to the tune of $9.5m which he told the
bank was for the importation of some processing
machine.
I want you to do me a favour to receive this funds to
a safe account in your country or any safer place as
the beneficiary .

I have plans to do investment in your country, like
real estate and industrial production.This is my
reason for writing to you. Please if you are willing
to assist me please indicate your interest.I have
mapped out 75% for ourselves and 20% for your cordial 
assistance and 5% for any expenses which may be
incurred in both locally and internationally.
