FYI.  Please make necessary changes to the form of guaranty attached to the Mahonia/ENA confirm to change the party to whom it is addressed from chase to Mahonia.  Se my marked version I sent to Clem.  Thanks

Clem,

I noted that the version you sent me was addressed to The Chase Manhattan Bank.  Actually, we are giving the Guaranty to Mahonia Limited.  Attached is the correct form of the Guaranty.

Anne,

I have attached the marked draft of the Enron Corp. guarantee reflecting the changes requested by Philip Levy.  Most of the changes are simply definitional in nature.  Please call me if you have any questions.

Clement
