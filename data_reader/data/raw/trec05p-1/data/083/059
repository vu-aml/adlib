Just as long as we're clear that the Aggies never lose;  they are only
"out-scored".

I think QGM is probably the only place you could take it, but even that is
not a slam dunk.  Black's Fork is full with the 40+mmcf/d we've been
sending them.  QGM has agreed to take about 18mmcf/d of unprocessed gas in
addition to the 40/d, but it has to be blended 1 for 1 with Shute Creek gas
in order for QPL to take it.  There is also a gathering fee on QGM (I think
$.07).  Since I'm new to this whole game and my shop hasn't taken over the
gas control yet (thank God for small favors), I'm not exactly sure how the
capacity at the QGM delivery point is being allocated.  Sherry Anderson at
AEC is still performing this service on a temporary basis.  Your Petrogulf
contact should give her a call to understand the options better.

6:45 tomorrow should work.  If you find that you can get away sooner, just
give me a call, as I will likely work until then.  I'm flexible on the
cuisine, so we don't have to do sushi (I do love it, though!).  It kind of
has to grow on you, because I didn't like it much at first.  Thai too spicy
for you??  Pick your favorite place and we'll go there.

As for your comment regarding Richard and the information I divulged above,
I think you and I both agree that you're forever indebted to me.

Excuses, Excuses the reason you lost was that your team scored less
points than the team you were playing.  It's that simple.  Anyway as for
dinner, what about staying downtown and meeting around 6:45 pm, if
that's too late we can meet earlier.  The only thing I know that is
healthy is Sushi, which isn't my favorite but I'd go if that's a big
thing for you.  Or, we can come up with other ideas, I'm wide open. I'll
eat anything except for Thai.

The lady I'm dealing with at Petrogulf is clueless.  The guy I used to
deal with is gone and she is new to this area of the business.  Since
I'm so nice and receptive to her feelings, I decided to help.  But I'm
sure you already know this about my personality.  I'm really not trying
to BS you with my emotional side.  I will tell her I can buy the gas
into Questar, if you believe that to be the case. All those other
delivery points need processing arrangements.  Don't tell Richard
Stewart anything about this conversation or YOUR buying dinner!

Paul,

The A&M game was tragic.  My friend Tim and I went to watch it at a
sports
bar and, needless to say, I was the only Aggie fan in the crowd.  We had
a
chance to tie it or win it in the last two minutes.  We had driven the
ball
from our own 9 yard line to about the CU 30 yard line.  We had a first
down
and were going for it when we fumbled ($%&*!!) and they took it back for
a
touchdown.  The waitress felt sorry for me and bought us a shot of I
don't
even know what.  I'm headed to Texas in a couple of weeks to see the
Aggies
Beat the Hell Outta Iowa State at Kyle Field.  I haven't been to Kyle
Field
in ages so I'm really looking forward to it.

Petrogulf's agreement indicates they have access to all major delivery
points except Opal until the expansion is in place.  These other points
would include QGM, MGR, OTTCO and QPL.  It's a bit curious to me that
they
would have QPL and OTTCO now since they have to go down the 20" to get
there.  Seems like these would be in the same boat with the Opal option,
so
maybe this is not a true, current option.  Can't Petrogulf tell you this
stuff?  It's not my place to do it, and the only reason I am is because
you're going to drop a large sum of money taking me out to dinner
(kidding!!).

As for dinner, yes I'm still available.  As for the place, don't feel
like
you need to drop a bunch of cash (although cash is thrilling, isn't
it??).
I'm happy eating just about anything.  I'm trying to be on a new health
kick, so healthy fare sounds appealing.  My only condition is that I
can't
stay out late because I have a 5:30am appointment at the gym with my
trainer Thurs. am.  It's brutal.  I leave the house at 5am.  Want to
stay
downtown or venture out?

Hello,

I'm back in the office today.  Well I see you have to eat crow!  I
didn't get a chance to watch the game but I saw CU play Kansas St. and
CU looked good. I even think CU has a good chance of beating UT in
Austin this weekend.

As far as Petrogulf goes, in the mean time before the great expansion,
do they have the right to go to Questar or any other interstate pipeline
delivery points.  I think they can take their gas in kind at
Questar/Bird Canyon, but I'm not sure.

And finally, are you still available for dinner Wednesday night.  I just
got paid so I'm looking to take you some place nice.  Yes, I am bribing
you!

Paul

Paul,

Once the expansion is completed (in the next couple of months),
Petrogulf
will have access to all delivery points off Jonah.  They currently don't
have access to Opal.  I think that's all the super secret information I
can
divulge.

Hope you have a great weekend.  I have a small wager with Shari Wojta
that
the Fightin' Texas Aggies will Beat the Hell Outta CU tomorrow.  Hope I
don't have to eat crow.

See you next week.
