I will be back in the office on Thursday. I can be reached on my cell phone if you need me. 713-858-1534. Santa pulled his back out while taking a ping-pong table off the sleigh!
 
I have looked at the list of customers and resorted by physical business for Texas. That list is attached. Please look through those other customers NOT listed in the top 50 for Texas and mak sure the list is OK. I also think we should look at ADDING customers we think will replace or at least be in addition to those top 50.
 
I would like to see the following added:
 
Texas Independent Energy
City of Garland
Southern Union
CPS - City of San Antonio
TECO
Saxet Petroleum
ExxonMobil
Comstock Resources
Lonestar Pipeline
Austin Energy - City of Austin
LCRA
 
We should look at our phone list and add those contacts to our list so to identify who we would like to attend the meeting. We also should have email addresses for most of these people so it would cut down on some time if we could also email the new contract to the customer for review as well.
 
JD and Morris, please look at this list and add customers as needed. Our business really depends on who we were begining to do business with and for our area, the rankings may need to change to reflect that difference. The column reflecting amount owed customer could be filled in from my spreadsheet I started mid-December. I know we are trying to start fresh but outstanding dollars owed customers will be an issue that will need to be addressed and we should know in the ballpark who and how much we owe. See if we can populate that column as well.
 
Call me if you have any questions or concerns,

Hope all had a good X-Mas - I did.
 
FYI the attached.  
 
Lets put this together for the Texas Region and then we can integrate it with the rest of the regions.  I will work with Barry, Laura, Frank, and Fred to come up with a common format and methodology that will tie the various regional plans together.  I will call on Friday to discuss - please let me know where you will be - in the office or at home.
 
Thanks,
Brian

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+       Infrastructure          Jenny Rub 
+       Development             Jay Webb 
+       EnronOnline             Webb / Forster 
+       HR                      David Oxley 
+       Cash Management Tom Myers 
+       Credit                  Debbie Brackett 

The rest will be completed shortly. 

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side

                                Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) 
                                Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)
