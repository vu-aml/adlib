OVERVIEW

 

This conference will examine the business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC's RTO initiatives.  The conference will review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and regional trading system.

Ancillary Services Conference

 

April 10-12, 2002, Denver, Colorado



OVERVIEW

 

As more and more regions in North America open wholesale markets to competition, the importance of ancillary services is increasingly recognized. These services, generally provided by the same generators that produce the competitive energy product, are vital for both commerce and reliability. 

 

This conference will cover the key engineering, economic, market, and policy issues associated with these functions. The conference will also present updates on the status of the various markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions, successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario, will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply these services.
