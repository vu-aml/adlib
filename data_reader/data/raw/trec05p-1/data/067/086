Stora Enso launches EUR 365M pulp line at Imatra, Finland, mill complex

10/01/2001 12:45:48, Press Release 


HELSINKI, Oct. 1, 2001 (press release) -- Stora Enso's Imatra mills form one of Europe's largest wood processing complexes, which now includes Europe's largest integrated pulp mill, following the inauguration of the new fibre line there today. The new line produces bleached birch pulp for the company's own paper and board mills. The main products of the Imatra mills are liquid packaging boards, boards for the food and drinks industry and fine paper. 

The new fibre line strengthens the Imatra mills' position as the only integrated manufacturer of liquid packaging boards and boards for the food and drinks industry. The mills produce all four different types of pulp required: bleached softwood pulp, bleached birch pulp, unbleached softwood pulp and thermomechanical pulp.

The new fibre line meets the latest environmental standards and optimises usage of raw materials. Water consumption has been decreased by dry debarking and the introduction of modern, efficient fibre production technology. Effluent discharges into waterways have been reduced. Odours have also been reduced by more effective recovery and processing of malodorous gases, which are utilised in producing the impregnation solution for thermomechanical pulping. The new production lines will be quieter, too.

Increased black liquor combustion will raise the proportion of energy generated from biofuels at the Imatra mills to 85%. 

In addition to the new fibre line, the former birch pulping line at Imatra has been modernized to produce pine pulp, and the bleached softwood pulping line at Kaukopaa has been shut down because it no longer met current production and environmental protection requirements. The project also included expansion of wood treatment, upgrading of the power plant and installation of a new pulp dryer. The total cost of the project was 365 million euros, and most of the new facilities were already in use in spring 2001....
