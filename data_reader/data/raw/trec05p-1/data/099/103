Thread-Topic: Paul Hennemeyer transfer to Mexico

Cc: "Shapiro, Richard" <Richard.Shapiro@ENRON.com>
Return-Path: Jo.Ann.Hill@ENRON.com

I do not have access to his current address.  Suzanne -- would you please be able to provide that information to Meliza?

Rick -- it is my understanding that Paul would be an employee of Enron Servicios de Mexico and not a Houston employee, and would be paid in mexican pesos equivalent to the US$ salary.  He would be taxed by the Mexican tax authority, not US.  Tim Callahan will set him up with a PWC tax consultant we utilize in Mexico to help him with his taxes in Mexico, but he would not fall under the tax equalization program like an expat. 

Please let me know if this is not what you were expecting.
Thanks.
Jo Ann
