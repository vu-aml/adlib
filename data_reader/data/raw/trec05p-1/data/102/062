Chris,

What is the spray that you hook up to your garden hose?
Non-toxic sounds good. Where do you buy it? Thanks!

Carmen Druke

P.S. Your e-mail address is bungalowlife, are you into arts
        and crafts houses?

 I have an electric fogger, Amy, if youwould like to use it. However, i 
must caution that it does use strong chemicals like the County fogger 
trucks. I use it and keep my dog inside for an hour or so until the smell 
dissapates. It has worked wonders. There is also a spray that youjust hook 
up to you hose and spray your yard, bushes and under your house. It is 
non-toxic and works really well also.
Let me know if you would like to use the fogger.

do not want to put anyone out, but I need some help. The mosquitoes are 
terrible.  It is hurting me to look at Kendall (my son) any more, as the 
number of bites on him have gone into the double digits. I cannot imagine 
that we are the only ones suffering from these nasty little pests, and I 
want to do something about it. If any of you have time tomorrow, can you do 
me this - can you call Harris County Mosquito Control and help me complain? 
 I figure that if a whole load of us start calling, they won't be able to 
ignore us. Their number is 713-440-4800.  I get a recording when I call, 
but their hours are 8 - 5, so maybe we can talk to a live person tomorrow. 
Thank you for helping me, and ultimately helping everyone. Best Regards, 
Amy Barnes
