Bases on the conversations I have over heard I understand there are discussions being held regarding the Enron Corp 1994 Deferral Plan and the value of the ENE stock held in those accounts related to a single sum distribution.  As you and I discussed previously I do not fault anyone for wanting to take their Deferred Values out subject to the 10% penalty.  After having struggled with the issue I do find a problem with the various interpretations of how the ENE stock should be valued.  Any method other than  the number of shares times the current market value is not fair to the thousands of Enron employee's who had ENE shares in there 401K account and were not afforded a look back option.  Some might say this is easy for me since I did not have ENE stock in either, but I do feel its a matter of treating everyone fairly.  Most employee's do not have access or knowledge of the Deferral Plan so it would probably go unnoticed, but that would not be equitable.  The solution in my mind, if the plan participants do not agree would be to deny an early single sum distribution which is a right, per my interpretation under the plan, this may encourage acceptance of the plans interpretation of the ENE stock valuation.  I appreciate your reading my input!
