With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=490&key=12797&"><B>Kurt Warner</B></A>, QB STL - Hardtail Amigos <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Warner had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401 yards and three touchdowns.

Santiago</B></A>, TE CLE - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Santiago catches the occasional pass for the Browns and could find the end zone every now or then. He's going up against a mediocre Cincinnati secondary, so maybe this is one of the rare weeks he scores. Only use Santiago if you're desperate for a tight end, however, as he rarely gets a big yardage total.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=490&key=133324&"><B>Kevin Johnson</B></A>, WR CLE - The Rocks <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Johnson has been a prime target for Tim Couch in the Cleveland passing game this season, and is now a very reliable No. 2 or 3 Fantasy receiver. Johnson is on a real hot streak and has a good career record against the Bengals, his opponent for this week, so get him into your lineup.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=490&key=133260&"><B>Tim Couch</B></A>, QB CLE - McKay <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Couch has a decent track record against the Bengals (453 passing yards, four TDs), whom he will face on Sunday. There are plenty worse quarterbacks you could choose from, so if you're reaching to find a starter this week, give him a look.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=490&key=187401&"><B>Peter Warrick</B></A>, WR CIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1!

pdated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Warrick has been catching a fair amount of passes this season, but hasn't provided stats worthy of using him on a weekly basis in a Fantasy league. His matchup against Cleveland on Sunday is unfavorable, so keep him reserved this week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=490&key=1212&"><B>Darnay Scott</B></A>, WR CIN - Pink Panthers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Although Scott has caught a touchdown pass in each of his last two games against the Browns, whom he plays Sunday, we can't recommend you use him this week. He has been far too inconsistent and a real disappointment from a Fantasy perspective.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=490&key=1847&"><B>Jon Kitna</B></A>
, QB CIN - Tomaski <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>We can't advise you use Kitna as he goes up against the Browns' secondary this week. Cleveland has been very stingy against the pass all year, leading the league in interceptions and ranking ninth overall in sacks.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=490&key=1681&"><B>Corey Dillon</B></A>, RB CIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Definitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up against the Browns on Sunday. He has a great career record against Cleveland (678 rushing yards, five rushing TDs in five games). Dillon should remain in your active lineup week in and week out in any league.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=490&ke!

Only use him if you have no other alternative on your bench.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=490&key=133393&"><B>Peerless Price</B></A>, WR BUF - Grigsby <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Price has established himself as a solid Fantasy receiver in recent weeks, logging 100-plus yards in three of his last six games. He faces a bigger challenge in Miami on Sunday, but right now you can't merit reserving him.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=490&key=1196&"><!

Eric Moulds</B></A>
, WR BUF - Fear <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>There's a good chance that Moulds will be inspired to have a good week against a solid Miami secondary after he voiced disapproval at his recent limited role in the Buffalo passing game. Pair that with the fact that he has a good history against the Dolphins (four TDs in last six games), and he might be worth using as a No. 2 or 3 receiver this week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=490&key=235093&"><B>Eric Johnson</B></A>, TE SF - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Johnson caught three passes for 34 yards last weekend against Carolina.

</A>, QB BUF - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Van Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a strong Dolphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar Seahawks, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this week despite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the bench for Week 11.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=490&key=187399&"><B>Travis Taylor</B></A>, WR BAL - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>After a few solid weeks, Taylor has returned to his old unproductive self.

Collins had a solid game yardage-wise against Minnesota, throwing for 321 yards on Monday night. However, he has had trouble getting the ball into the end zone consistently, which makes him a risky Fantasy player. As a result, benching him in Week 11 against Oakland is advisable. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=490&key=1234&"><B>Willie Jackson</B></A>, WR NO - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Jackson has been somewhat inconsistent as a Fantasy player, but he does have the potential to post great numbers every week. If you play in a deeper league, it's worth taking a gamble on Jackson against New England. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=490&key=1511&"><B>Joe Horn</B></A>, WR NO - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><!

><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Horn is dealing with a number of nagging injuries, but he's been playing through them quite well. In fact, Horn has 14 catches for 247 yards and two touchdowns in his last two games, and is a must-start in Week 11 against New England based on his potential to post huge numbers. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=490&key=235196&"><B>Michael Bennett</B></A>, RB MIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Bennett is proving all the critics right who said he wasn't ready for the NFL style of game.
