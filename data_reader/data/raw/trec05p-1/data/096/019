In just two weeks, a roster of the brightest and most
seasoned technology investment, entrepreneurial and
management talent will be sharing their experiences,
war stories and perspectives on what it's going to
take to continue to build companies through 2002.
They'll share how they financed and structured companies
in past downturns to position them for success.  They'll
explain what the leadership focus should be, and
what sales and marketing strategies they adopted
to continue growing while the competition fell by
the wayside.

On November 6, at the Fairmont, San Jose, hear Bill
Campbell, the Chairman of Intuit, define the essence of
leadership in difficult times.  Matt L'Heureux, head of
worldwide technology M&A at Goldman Sachs will share
his expertise on what it takes to ensure your company
is a contender on next year's M&A prospect lists.
Ken Wilcox, President & CEO of Silicon Valley Bank,
will reflect on your current and future financing options.
And these are just a sample of the high-caliber speakers
participating at VentureWire's Executive Summit.  For
a full list of speakers and profiles, please link to:
