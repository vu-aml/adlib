AOPA ePilot Subscribers,

Let's try this one more time. Our last correction message came 
through with some letters missing. Here (we sure hope) is a 
version that you can read:

Please disregard the message at the top of this morning's issue 
of "AOPA ePilot" that suggested that your AOPA membership was 
about to expire or that it was your last issue of the newsletter. 
Holiday computer gremlins conspired to erroneously send the 
message to most "ePilot" subscribers this morning.

Again, please disregard the message. We apologize for the error 
and will work to assure that it does not happen again. Thank you 
for your patience and please have a Happy New Year.

Sincerely,

AOPA ePilot Staff
