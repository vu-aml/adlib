FYI--
 
Sorry for the late notice, but our office has been invited to attend a private Blazers Practice today.  The doors to the Rose Garden open at 5 p.m. and the practice is from 6 to 7 p.m.
 
Tickets for entry are not necessary.  If you would like to attend go to the gate, mention you are with Enron North America and that Tina Tate (our Blazers Sales Rep) told us we could attend without tickets.  There is no reserved seating for this event.  The announcement below says there will be complimentary food and beverage coupons available as well as complimentary on-site parking.  
 
Let me know if you have any questions.
 
Debra Davidson
