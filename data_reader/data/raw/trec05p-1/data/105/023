I have reviewed the list you sent me regarding items you would like to see in the Data Room.  I spoke to Ned Greenwood and Jerry Mouser (the project coordinators) about this list.  We do have several of the items you listed, however, rather than having every document available, we have our Engineers, Legal Counsel and Financial Advisor available and ready to meet with you one-on-one.
If you would like to fax a list of specific questions you may have, please do so.  I would also like to ask that you please send me a list of the people who will be coming with you and their titles or job responsibilities.  We look forward to meeting with you here on Monday and we'll do our best to make your time worthwhile. 
Thank you.
