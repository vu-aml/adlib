Dear Evening MBAs -

WELCOME TO HAAS or WELCOME BACK, whatever the case may be....

I work closely with your Evening MBAA VPs of Alumni Affairs, Tom Schneberger and Bharath Rangarajan, to make sure you know about all the alumni activities and programs.  If, for some reason, you would like to meet with me to discuss other alumni services and connections, please email me to arrange a meeting.  

Just a reminder that we encourage you to incorporate alumni networking into your business school experience from day one. Alumni will be an essential resource to you for class projects, career advice, internships, and long-term professional opportunities. My overall recommendation is that you tap into the online resources that the Haas Alumni Network provides and attend as many student - alumni events as you can!

A few things I want to emphasize to you:

# 1 INFORMATION YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT REGISTERING WITH THE
HAAS ALUMNI NETWORK ONLINE COMMUNITY

A)  YOUR STUDENT ID = YOUR FIRST TIME SECURITY ID for this password 
protected community

B) WHEN REGISTERING, SELECT A USER ID that you LIKE (select it as 
carefully as you would a tattoo... because this is also your prefix for 
your lifelong Haas alumni email address). For example, if your 
haas/uclink account is mthompson@haas. you should choose mthompson as 
your USER ID and it will automatically become the first part of your 
email forwarding address - mthompson@alumni.haas.org. Since your 
friends will come to memorize your school email address, get them in the 
habit early of knowing what your lifelong email forwarding address will 
be.

C) REGISTER NOW SO that you can

....ACTIVATE YOUR HAAS LIFELONG EMAIL FORWARDING ADDRESS (and START 
PUTTING IT ON YOUR STUDENT BUSINESS CARDS/RESUME)

....UPDATE YOUR ONLINE DIRECTORY PROFILE 
as a student you automatically have a profile in the directory and we 
ENCOURAGE you to put in any relevant work or industry experience so that 
other alumni and students can network with you in your specific field or 
industry. For example, if you are doing working at HP *and* 
attending school part-time, you might be a really good resource to 
another student considering that type of work at that specific company. You can enhance the 
network by showcasing your skills, connections, and expertise in your 
online directory profile. Please make sure your address and 
business info is current.

#2:  MARK YOUR CALENDARS TO COME TO THE FOLLOWING STUDENT - ALUMNI FOOTBALL TAILGATES IN THE COURTYARD (two hours before kickoff):

- Oct. 13
- Nov. 3
- Nov. 10 

sponsored by the MBAA and the Haas Alumni Network.

#3:  BOOKMARK THE ALUMNI WEBSITE ON YOUR COMPUTER:  <http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/alumni/>

Enjoy your experience at Haas.... and please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Tenny Frost
Director, Alumni Relations
