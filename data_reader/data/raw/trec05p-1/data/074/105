Dear Team:

Our originators are in need of regional market information.  They are in search of capacity and consumption data for three regions: North America, Asia-Pacific and Europe.  

The problem we're facing is that each publication is disclosing very different numbers.  I think RISI is the publication which contains the most data across these commodities.  If RISI data is not available for your commodity, please send me any data that is available.  Also, please disclose units if possible.  

The information requested is for a presentation for Ray Bowen this week.  The following is this presentation.  If you have any further questions please contact me.  Thanks for all your help!!

Regards,
Laura
