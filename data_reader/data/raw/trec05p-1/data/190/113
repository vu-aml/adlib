Awww Jeahh.  It's nice to hear from you.  Ive 
been trying to get in touch with yall for quite 
some time.

Please reply back to this message and let me 
know how "Things" are.  Yes, the question is 
ambiguous, but try to go with it.

In response to "What up?:"

Everything has reached a new status quo. I live 
in Gig Harbor and attend class at UW Tacoma 
(UWT for short).  Class is great and their are 
plenty of beautiful lasses for viewing 
pleasure.  Hopefully I will be out of GH soon.  
I will start looking for jobs in Portland, 
Seattle, and SF (possibly) in Spring.  I have 
not been working on my tan.

I would really like to visit the city of Roses 
in the next few weekends.  What are your 
plans?   I hope everything is well with you.  
Please write back soon.

Buenos Nachos,
Scott
