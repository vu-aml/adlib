Greg can you se me about this.  MS wants a Master in place before they will transact with us for physical gas.  They have proposed the GISB.  We need to confirm if we even transact physical gas with MS, or if this is an ENA issue, and if we do if we can use our from of Master or alternatively our Canadianized GISB Ts and Cs.

Dear Jeff: 
Thanks for your time earlier today.  Attached, please find the draft GISB and special provisions for each of Enron North America Corp. and Enron Canada Corp.  If you can forward the drafts for the Canadian entity to your counterpart in the Calgary office, I'd greatly appreciate it. 
You may coordinate with me to finalize the agreements.  If you have any questions, or if I may be of further assistance, please feel free to contact me at your convenience. 
Kind Regards, 
Dan
