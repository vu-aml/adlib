***POLL***
THIS WEEK'S POLL:
Does your company have a customer privacy policy?
Let us know!
http://www.informationsecurityworld.com/Tmpl/Archpolls.asp?CID=16

RESULTS OF LAST WEEK'S POLL:
Would you lend your biometric info to a friend?
51.4% Yes
48.6% No

***PORTAL DISCUSSION***
A recent survey has found that 56% percent of people would be willing to share their fingerprint or eyeball identification to enter public or corporate buildings, while 35% are concerned about sacrificing their privacy for better security. Why is this? 

Here's what you're saying:
"Passwords are readily transferable. You introduce biometrics to eliminate "sharing". This can be made impossible by storing biometrics on a secure token and implementing a token match process. No database storage required!! Then only you can access your entitlement. Simple!"

"I think somehow that you have missed the point. Using biometrics to limit administrative access on your network would work using your "simple" proposition but the question refers more to the problem of physical access. Maybe you can explain how creating a cookie will help if someone decides to let someone else into their office block by putting their finger in the biometric device and holding the door open for the other person to come in as well."

Have your say:
