Hello Jay,

The On Line Registration Form is up and running. I cannot change the default
setting for the "Enter" key which is why we posted a warning at the top of
the page. Hopefully folks will read the warning.

See ya,
Bruno <><


PS to Jerry Booth - It's probably a good idea to start pushing the On-Line
registration to our congregation, other Church groups and the public.

I have had a few people test the system.  It looks like it works very
well except if you hit ENTER instead of TAB then the form will be
submitted.  If that could be corrected so that you have to hit the
SUBMIT button to submit, then I think it is ready to go.

Sorry it took so long for me to get back to you and thanks again for
your hard work on this.

Jay
