Habitat for Humanity Project 

October 22, 2001 




My apologies to those of you that did not find the new site last Saturday.  The Habitat folks were supposed to have someone visit the Chickasaw site, but it appears that did not happen.   

Our family, the Franco's, were at the Tangiers site Saturday, dressed in our St.Paul's/Habitat tee shirts.  Fourteen year old Jose, Jr., was in the middle of the construction, cutting door openings with a Sawzall.  Imagine his pride in helping build his family's home. 

We (I) had a problem with mosquitos, ants and poison ivy last Saturday.  We will have lots of bug repellent and I will try to rope off the poison ivy.  If you have concerns, please see me at the registration table Saturday. 

Special thanks to Jeanie Koch for assembling a first aid kit and standing at the ready; to Mark McConnell for finding hard hats for our group; to Ken Jones for coffee, donuts, juice and soda to keep us fueled all day, and to all the workers who managed to complete the interior walls and to cap the exterior walls, and still get us out by 3:30!   

The new address is 10223 Tangiers.  This is about eight blocks from the old location but is somewhat simpler to get to.  Directions: Take Interstate 10 to the Gessner exit and head north.  Tangiers is approximately ½ mile past Clay Road and is the third street on the left.  Left on Tangiers to 10223 on the left. 

Alternate route: From Highway 290, take the 43rd Street exit and go west.  43rd Street turns into Clay Road.  Continue on Clay to Gessner.  Right on Gessner approximately ½ mile to Tangiers, which is the third street on the left.  Left on Tangiers to 10223 on the left. 

I have attached a schedule for the remaining weeks of the Project.  Please let me know if additional changes are needed. 

See you Saturday! 

Les
