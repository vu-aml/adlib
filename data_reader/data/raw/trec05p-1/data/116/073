Whassup Daddy-O!?!  How are you?
My wife got me your number and told me she saw you.  Sounds like the kids
are doing fine, which is awesome.
We need to do lunch ASAP.  Call me at 713-569-8137 when you get a chance.
Take care and send your wife, sister, dog, mom, kids, etc., etc. my love.
Chris
