Let me know how you want me to handle, but I knew I would get screwed on this.

Do you think I should play hard ball with them.  Mike has already emailed me and said that he will try to work on them from his end.

I need him to start getting involved with EES to offload Scott and really progress the strategic system side,  and with more Risk people on the table now in Houston, I would think that if London can't give him up, then maybe we should consider another option with someone from EIM or EGM.

Let me know what you think

I have been speaking with Matthew regarding the "work-out" plan for EBS in Euorope and it looks as though he'll require my services here in London up until beginning of Jan-02.

There are a number of options we are currently looking at, but all of them still require a large amount of work.

As I was originally due to fly to the US in the first week of December and fly back for Chistmas, I'm only really missing out on about 10 working days in EES.

Given the status of the "work-out" plan I do not want to leave EBS in it's current unfinished state. Potentially there is a $17m write/off and due to the lack of historic knowledge regarding EBS, I consider myself a key individual in minimising this exposure - I have spoken to Mike Jordan and he fully supports a Jan-02 being most beneficial to Enron as a whole.

Does this work for you ?

Thanks

Neil
