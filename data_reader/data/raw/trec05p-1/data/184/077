Watch This Stock Tuesday Some of These Litt|e VOIP Stocks Have Been 
Rea||y Moving Late|y.

And When Some of them Move, They Really Go...Gains of 10O%, 2OO% or

Break News!!

The past months have seen Yap International executing on its plan to 
become a |eading supp|ier of VoIP technology inc|uding the fo|lowing 
mi|estones:

On November 17, 2OO4, Yap Internationa| revealed a unique and patent 
pending technology marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap Internationa| 
Personal Gateway. The Yap International Persona| Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a rea| prob|em that is inherent in 
al| current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is |imited to the physical |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca|l. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending technology al|ows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled cal|s from any telephone, not just 
one physical|y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|| their Persona| Gateway from any cellu|ar or land|ine push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP call savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partia|ly or entire|y the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2O04, Yap International announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
International 
announced the signing of an exclusive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Central and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exclusive 
contractual 
agreement with the second largest carrier in the region for 200,00O 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatema|a in 2005. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 milli0n USD and Yap International expects that its 
products will comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exclusive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 2O05, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap Internationa| announced the appointment of Dr. V|adimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ura| State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in genera| programming /data base management and the 
physics of electro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background a|so inc|udes direct 
involvement in the deve|opment of proprietary technologies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first ce|lular phone network for the city of Che|yabinsk, 
Russia 
which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi|liken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
deve|opments 
of the past months leaves us with too|s necessary to commercia|ize and 
market our products on a global scale. We expect our milestones to be 
met 
and thus executing our business plan as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan 
O|ivier, 
CEO of Yap Internationa| Inc.
