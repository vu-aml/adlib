Tana - Would you be able to help me out by looking in our ISDAs with PG&E Energy Trading - Gas Corporation and PG&E Energy Trading - Power L.P. and letting me know their notices addresses.  I need these as I am trying to get the requisite security registrations done in respect of the master netting agreement with PG&E.  If you are unable to assist me please let me know.

Thanks
CJG

Sharon - I need your assistance with respect to the registrations that we have to do in respect of the PG&E Master Netting Agreement.  In this regard would look up the address for PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation as such address is set out in the notice provisions of our gas master with PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation.

Also, could you do the same for CEG Energy Options Inc., PG&E Energy Trading - Power L.P. and PG&E Energy Trading - Gas Corporation.  If we do not have masters in place, look in other executed agreements, and if no agreements are executed please look in recent drafts of unexecuted agreements (and note that the address is from an unexecuted draft).

If you have any questions please call or email.

Thanks
CJG
