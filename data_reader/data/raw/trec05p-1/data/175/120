Dear Stacey,

First of all, I need thank you for good common you have given to me. I believe that is an main reason why I still can work for Enron. 

As today's Netco list. I am not in that list. I have talked to Steve Nat. He told me I am last person he took out from the list. He is going to try to add me to the list. He told me there is still possible to add one or two persons to the list.
 
After reading the list. I found there are 25 Gas people in Netco list and only 24 Power people in Netco list.
I believe there still is possibility to ask for one more position for power people.
 
There are many types Excel reports for your groups. I believe your group definitely need high level Excel VBA to support and develop those reports.
 
Some people in Netco power list do know Excel, even Visual Basic, but Excel+Visual Basic is far away from high level Excel VBA and there is no Excel VBA for Netco Power list.  I was a Access VBA before I joined Enron, but at very beginning I had a lot of trouble for Excel VBA. Mr. Zhiyong Wei once worked on Excel VBA (I took his Excel VBA responsibility after I joined Enron) he knows that position very well. Also his (gas) Excel term has 3 persons. Two are with Sr. title and one Spec.  If Excel VBA is not necessary for our system he definitely doesn't want three high level persons. This summer Mr. Wei told Sanjay at front of whole my group that "Min is busiest person in your group".  He knows my responsibility and he has seen how hard I am working. He knows my working hours even more than his. 
 
This year I not only have developed a lot of Excel applications, but also have optimized applications and made them much more stable than I took the responsibility.  I was over booked for long time. I take care 90% of Excel Support and develop for your group. Sanjay always promised me to hire more persons ASAP. Excel in power did have three persons as Gas on 12/2/2001. In my first Enron year, I lived in The Woodlands. At that period,  most of time I took 202 bus to work, but not Bus from Woodlands because I typically needed worked >10 hours every day and last 202 bus is 10pm, but Woodlands is 7pm. I often took last bus of 202. Sometimes, I missed my last bus or sometimes there are too many works. I even worked whole night at my desk.
 
Excel VBA job market is very small. Only trading companies need high level Excel VBA. Since that, not many people want to be that area. Companies which need Excel VBA have extremely hard time to hire good Excel VBA. For e.g. Sanjay had waited for more than 8 months and interviewed dozens people before he got Steve Skornia. On other hands, Excel VBA also have extremely hard time to find a job. 
 
I only have moved to Houston for 1.5 year. I just buy a house and two new cars. I have two children with age 4 and 2. I have given up my personal life and family life and contributed all my energy to Enron. If I lost my job, that will be disaster for me and my family. 
 
My appreciations is more than any words can express if you could continue to give your nice common in case some one ask whether you need a Excel VBA.
 
Merry Christmas to you and your family.
 
Min Zheng
