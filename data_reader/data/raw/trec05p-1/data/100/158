FYI, 

Unit #5 was scheduled to be back available on 10/31/01. (Installing New PLC) The programmers have delayed their arrival from this week to next week to do the programming. This would push back the completion date about a week. Tom Gilbert and the Waterloo Team are not happy about this, since this is not the first time we have been delayed. They are going to look into what's going on and possible other options.
