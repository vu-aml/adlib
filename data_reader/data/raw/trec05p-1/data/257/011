Crab Pate with Almonds 

List of Ingredients: 

1/2 cup butter 
1/2 cup chopped unblanched almonds 
1 small onion, chopped 
3 ounces cream cheese 
8 ounces backfin crab meat 
1 tablespoon brandy 
1/4 teaspoon ground mace 
salt to taste 

Preparation Instructions: 
Melt the butter over medium heat in a small skillet. When it foams, add the almonds. Turn the heat to low and saute the almonds, stirring often, until they are golden brown. Remove them with a slotted spoon and reserve. Cook the onion in the same butter, stirring often, until it is wilted and just starting to turn gold. Remove from pan. Reserve the butter. Use a processor, blender, or mortar and pestle to crush the almonds and onions to a smooth paste. In a small bowl, work the cream cheese until it is soft, then work in the almond and onion puree. Stir in the crab meat and seasonings, adding the reserved butter last. Let the pate mellow for 15 minutes or so, then taste it and adjust the salt. This pate will stay good for 3 or 4 days in the refrigerator. Let it come almost to room temperature before serving, then serve with crusty French bread.
