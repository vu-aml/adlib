Vince:
 
For some reason, I found it very easy to leave Enron last  February.  I had been blessed with a great run, but I knew the future for  me lay elsewhere.  
 
I didn't look back, I moved on.  But for the past week, I've been  drawn back to reconnect - to check on friends and others I worked with to see  how they're (you're) doing.  I enjoyed the time we spent together  in the EGS, ECT, etc. days.  Vince,  I always respected  and admired the way you conducted yourself.  You were talented and hard  working.  You put together an outstanding team.  You  achieved, deservedly, much success in your time at Enron.  But you never  let it get to your head.  You were always friendly and gracious to  everyone.  The environment at Enron allowed and even sometimes encouraged  people to be otherwise, but you resisted.  You have Class.    
 
Are you still part of the "clean-up crew" or have you moved on?  If  you're still there, thank you.
 
I hope this finds you well (given the shock of all things Enron).  You  most assuredly have a bright future.  Enjoy the exploration of where life  will lead you next.
 
Take care!  Call or write if you wish.
 
God Bless,
 
-Bob
