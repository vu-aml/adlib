Strategic Research Institute Presents:
 
2ND ANNUAL 
FUELCELL 
INVESTOR
 A Unique Networking Opportunity To Talk Directly To CEOs Of Virtually All Publicly Traded FC Companies And Other Executives Whose Decisions Can Change The Future Of The Industry!
March 26 - 27, 2002 w The Roosevelt Hotel w New York, NY

The rapidly expanding fuel industry was recently given yet another boost, as the Bush administration last week abandoned a multi-billion dollar, eight-year project to develop high-mileage gasoline-fueled vehicles and instead is throwing its support behind a plan to develop hydrogen-based fuel cells to power the cars of the future.


With the highest possible level of speakers in the fuel cell industry, this summit offers unparallel networking potential. Some major blue chip companies will be presenting, among them Air Products, Dupont, GE Equity, General Motors, Ford and Morgan Stanley.



This event will be a unique opportunity to hear from and talk directly to CEOs of virtually all publicly traded FC companies: Walter (Chip) Schroeder, Proton Energy; H. Frank Gibbard, H Power; Jerry D. Leitman, FuelCell Energy; Bill Acker, Mechanical Technology; Stephen S. Tang, Millennium Cell; Pierre Rivard, Hydrogenics; Robert K. Lifton, Medis Technology; John Donohue, DCH Technology, plus CFOs and Directors of several more fuel cell companies, including Plug Power, Ceramic Fuel Cells and many others.
