Dear Friend,

with shell Development Company in Nigeria. Here in after, shall be referr=
ed

ildren
were involved in a car accident along Sagamu express way.

All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives in the proces=
s

of my clients extended relatives or his next of kin, this has also proved=

unsuccessful.After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to cont=

a notice as the branch manager and personal account manager to the deceas=
e,to
provide the next of kin. Or have the account confiscated within the next
ten official working days.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 2years
now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the decease=
d
so that this account valued at ($25.5 million u.s.dollars) can be paid to=

you as the next of kin since you bear the same surname with him and then
me and you Can share the money.70% to me and 30% to you.We are going to
engage the services of an attorney who will help us to depose a sworn aff=
idavit

am still working with my bank.

t
