This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the
fact that we have not yet met.  I have to say that I
have no intentions of causing you any pains so i
decided to contact you through this medium .
As you  read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for
me, because, I believe everyone  will die someday.
My name is DANIEL ALBERT, a merchant in Dubai, in the
U.A.E. I  have been diagnosed with prostate and
esophageal Cancer that was discovered  very late
due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has
defiled  all forms of medication  and right now, I have
only about a few months to live  according to medical
experts.
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I
never really  cared for  anyone not even myself but
my business. Though I am very rich, I was never
generous, I was always hostile to people and only
focus on my  business as that  was the only thing I
cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know
that  there is more to life than just wanting to
have or make all the money in the world. I believe
when God gives me a second chance to come to this
world I  would live my life a different way from
how I have lived it. Now that I know my  time is
near, I have willed and given most of my properties
and assets to my immediate and extended family members
and as well as a few close friends and Schools in
the UAE. I have decided to give alms to charity
organizations, as I want this to be one  of the last
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed
money to some  charity organizations in the U.A.E,
London and Ireland and also to the victims of tsunami. 
Now that my health has deteriorated
so badly, I cannot do this my self any more. I once
asked members  of my family to close one of my accounts
and donate the money which I have  there to charity
organization in Bulgaria, they refused and kept the
money to  themselves. Hence, I do not trust them
anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what
I have left for them. The last of my money which is
the  huge cash deposit that I have with Financial
Firm Abroad .(Detail of the security/finance 
company shall be made known to you when i recieve your positive 
response to this mail). I will want you to help me collect this
deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations
and let  them know that  I DANIEL ALBERT that is
making these generous donations.
I am writing this from my laptop computer in my hospital
bed where I wait for my  time to come. I pray that God
uses you to support and assist me with good heart
I am willing to compensate you with 20% of the total
sum for your assistance,In this transaction, confidentiality is
very essential for us to achieve our goal. It is 
important that you maintain utmost sincerity and trust.

In conclusion I will like you to understand that this 
transaction is 100% risk free.

God be with you.

Mr.Albert Ahmed
