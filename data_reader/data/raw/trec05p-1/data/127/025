That sounds like a plan! It's pretty easy to get to Stinson from the wine country. Let's invite a few more folks and call it a party!

We can come in on Thursday evening (so we can spend friday in the wine country) and leave sunday afternoon at 3:20 for 20000 miles!  So we are definitely in!  What do you think?

I understand the need to find cheap flights. this whole enron meltdown has forced us all to take a closer look at our personal balance sheets. i imagine it might be pretty hard to take monday off, but one option would be to catch a morning flight home on monday. i'd be very inclined to do so, but it may be hard for you guys. maybe you have some work to do in California?? i will probably stay through sunday night. check with southwest airlines-- they may have a cheaper fare to oakland, and i can definitely get you to that airport. any thoughts on who else from houston might want to come down?

el, I think you sent this to the wrong place.  just talked to suzanne and she is in - as long as we can get there cheap.  As for Sunday, when do you think people will leave.  Being 2 hours later here in houston, we might have to leave pretty early.  what are your thoughts?

Thx

I certainly understand your concerns and believe that they should be voiced.  I will also babysit the situation and try to make sure she abides by the rules!

We should definitely invite Rosie, but she has to promise to stay out of my parents' bedroom!

El,
I am in for sure.  Just gotta look into possibly using miles.  I think Suz might be in as well.  What about Rosie?  Let me now the details!
Thanks for the invite - 

K.

My folks have offered to let us use Chez Stinson for the weekend od Dec 15-16. Do you think you guys can motivate a Houston group to the Bay Area for a few days?
