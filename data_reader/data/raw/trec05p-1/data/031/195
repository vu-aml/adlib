Dear OSCers, 

Doing away with the path, or even not keeping it serial within the 1.7 
tags is unacceptable because it will not work with the IDC. 

Sure you could program the IDC to reconstruct the path, but the 
processing time then becomes a performance issue for the IDC. That is 
not acceptable...ALL tags in the EI go to the IDC, so it becomes a real 
processing problem. 

Remember these things work as a single system! E-Tag 1.7 will NOT be 
implemented without working properly with the IDC...they are 
interdependent.

Jerry, 

  I also do not recall any discussion regarding doing away with the path 
on 
ETag 1.7.  I would be interested in knowing how the TISWG and the IS 
would 
be unaware of this issue if in fact there is a push to elliminate paths. 

Thoughts? 
Julie
