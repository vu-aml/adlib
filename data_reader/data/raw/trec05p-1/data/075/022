Carl:

I was recently informed via Janet Bowers at NNG that there have been some issues with regard to the gas contract to serve the Pleasant Valley Peaker.  In order to have someone address your issues, I have passed on your concerns to Darron Giron who works Mid-Market and Origination on the Central Gas Desk.  Darron's number is 713-853-9573.  I have also made the VP of the Central Gas Desk aware of your concerns.  You should be getting a call from Darron in the next couple of days after he has had a chance to get up to speed on the transaction.

I am now doing long term power marketing in the ECAR region and thought it was best to let the gas desk address this; however, please feel free to contact me should the situation warrant.

Thanks
