IN THE NEWS...
New Federal Initiative to Focus on Diabetes and Women
Of the estimated 16 million Americans with diabetes, more than half are women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  The CDC recently launched its new three-phased initiative on women and diabetes.  The initiative, co-sponsored by the American Diabetes Association,  the American Public Health Association (APHA) and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), will work to curb the recent rise in diabetes among women.

Eat Your Way to Better Health
The American Diabetes Association released new nutritional guidelines in the January, 2002 issue of Diabetes Care, the Association's journal of clinical research.  The new guidelines emphasize recent evidence that exercise and lifestyle choices can play major roles in managing and even preventing diabetes.  Other interesting studies in the January issue include research on how stress management can affect blood sugar and the annual costs diabetes expenses cost employers.

Overfeeding Rapidly Induces Leptin and Insulin Resistance
Hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia and hyperleptinemia coexist in common forms of obesity. A team of researchers from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, New York, recently demonstrated that overfeeding mice induces leptin and insulin resistance in test subjects.  The study, led by Dr. Luciano Rossetti, was published in the December, 2001 issue of the journal Diabetes.

A Few Sips a Day Could Cut Heart Disease Risk
Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health recently found that men with type 2 diabetes who consume moderate amounts of alcohol each day reduce their risk of heart disease.  Compared with nondrinkers, men who drank one-half to two drinks daily cut their heart disease risk by 36 percent, and men who drank more than two drinks a day had a 41 percent lower risk of heart problems.
