Mike,

Sorry, I did not get a chance to say goodbye.  It was kind of crazy the day that they told everyone to leave.

I wish you all of the luck there.  From the paper this morning, it looks like that you will be auctions to the highest bidder.  It is kind of sad.  

I am currently working out of Enron's out placement service in Allen III.  The facilities are pretty nice.  The job market is pretty slow.  It gives me plenty of time to get my yard in shape.  Ha!

Also, I have been spending a lot of time at Rockport.  The next time you go down there in the future, please come by and see our place.  We are on Fulton Beach Road just north of Trailor Inn By The Bay.  You never know, I may be moving there sooner than you think.  Ha!

Take care and good luck always.

Bob
