Forsake the foolish, and live and go in the way of understanding.
He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks
When he prepared the heavens, I was there when he set a compass upon the face of the depth
In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.

<FONT style="font-size: 1px;">Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge but he that hateth reproof is brutish. All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes but the LORD weigheth the spirits. Till a dart strike through his liver as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life. Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. Wise men lay up knowledge but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.</FONT>
