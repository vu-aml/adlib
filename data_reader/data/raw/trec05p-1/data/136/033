The provisional agenda is:

Hiring protocol - agree wording. Suggestion: No severance payment from Enron, no 4 or 5 performers, and minimum 90 day sit out for all no-compete individuals.
Severance update: illustration of current and revised plans which we have yet to decide on.
Overview of Nov 27 areas of headcount reduction.
More detailed overview of HR planned re-structuring (still high level - although I would be interested in seeing if she is interested in any potentially redundant talent)
Overview of retention plan.

Please comment.

Tim/Scott, please help prepare pack I will need and make sure legal are ok with what we all agree to hand over to her on above.

David
