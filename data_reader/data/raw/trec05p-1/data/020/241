Dear Sir,/Madam,

Sequel to the secretive arrangement in regards of the shipment of your =
contract sum, I wish to inform you that all necessary modalities have been =
automatically concluded and have left Nigeria to Spain via your Country today =
by Express Cargo Flight.

Note carefully the content of the crate is "MONEY" but I did not disclose it =
to the Courier Services as Money, rather I informed them that the crate =
contain Vital "DIPLOMATIC DOCUMENTS" belonging to my client (that=92s =
you).Furthermore, the weight of the consignment is 90kg but I manage to =
pay45kg, which cost US$9,600.000.00 On no account should you disclose the =
content of the crate with the Diplomatic Courier Services for fear of =
betrayal. So do not allow 
them to know that the content is money.

In the meantime, contact the Gonet Security And Dipomatic Courier Services to =
the Attn. Mr JOHN SMITH, on Tel: 00-34-628-667-674 or Email =
:jsmithmadrid@yahoo.es to know the actual situation with the consignment and =
also give them your address where the consignment will be delivered and then =
get back to me as soon as possible so that I can give you the shipment =
document.
Meanwhile, I will be coming over to your country immediately the consignment =
arrives in your Country for my 10% share.

Please update me as you contact the Global Trust Diplomatic Courier Services =
for more details you may need from me.

Congrats and remain blessed.
Best Regards,

Yours faithfully,
Dr. Mrs  LEILA Abiola
