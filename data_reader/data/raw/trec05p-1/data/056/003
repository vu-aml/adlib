Elliot & Richard:
The Ontario team is developing a wind project (as you know Elliot).  Jan has asked me to send her some regulatory background/trading market and REC premium information for the US.  I adapted one of my slide presentations for the regulatory part, which both of you have already seen.  What I'd like your feedback on is the attached slide w/ the premium information (second to last slide).  Understand that I'm trying to be sensitive and not give too much "competitive" information, but want to provide her w/ an overview of how the supply/demand picture affects the premium per region.  
 
Let me know your thoughts/suggestions.  Also, Elliot, Richard and I worked on the fundamentals all morning & made some progress.
