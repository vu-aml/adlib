Hi John,
 
Just doing Saturday clean up stuff.
 
I feel a bit ackwardly positioned in the Midway deal.  I will try to get
some clarification of my role.  I think that Bart would like for me to
handle it, but Sheila thinks it should be handled in her group. By the
way, I think some quality time (hint, bring Ken or another power lawyer)
might be a good thing.  She would probably love a polo day (she lives at
the Houstonian, so that's easy for her).  She's very savvy and
practical, so you should get along.
 
Kay
