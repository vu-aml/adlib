ATTN,
With great pleasure I am writing this proposal on behalf of my partners. I have the mandate of my senior colleagues Mr. Mark Umalen, to solicit the assistance of foreign business partners in this matter, Hence I have decided to seek your cooperation and assistance in this business of mutual benefit by sending this letter to you.
There is a program currently on, in the department were I work as projects director. Inviting holders with proof of government indebtedness that stands at an envisaged accruing interest of $645.2 million on projects and supplies, to submit same to enable their claims go through payment process. Some of these debts have been redeemed in their principal component leaving behind accrued interest portion unpaid.
Within the Department of Minerals and Energy were I work, we have been able to record an accrued interest bills of Twenty-eight million Five hundred thousand United States Dollars ($28,500,000.00) on supplies which we have in principle, an approval to remit overseas. This we can do by appropriate forms of documentation with application for claim to reflect the approval and payment. 
Our constraint is to be able to source a trustworthy individual, to whom we can remit this fund and act as trustee, since our period of disengagement from the civil service is near.
 We are presently affected by the South African civil service code of conduct, which prohibits civil servants from operating foreign accounts. Moreover, I have the authority of my partners to propose that should you be willing to assist us in this transaction, you will be highly compensated on percentage bases.
This transaction should be handled with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Furthermore, your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction.
Kindly contact me on 27 73 493 2406, to indicate your willingness as a partner.
Yours faithfully,                                                 
ENGR. TOM BONGANI.
