DONATION FOR THE LORD
From: Mrs. Praise Uwaoma

PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.I am the above name
person from Sierra-Leone. I am married to Dr Theophilus Uwaoma who worked=

with Sierra Leonian Embassy in South Africa for nine years before he died=

in the year 2001. We were married for eleven years without a child. He di=
ed
after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we=

were both born again Christians and we lived happilly. Since his death,
I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home whic=
h
the Bible is really against.

When my late husband was alive he secured $15Million (Fifteen Million U.S=
.
Dollars) with financial institution here in Cote D'Ivoire. Presently, thi=
s
money is still with the financial institution. Recently, my Doctor told
me that from all the test conducted on my health, I am not going to last
long, expecially, due to my cancer and stroke. But what disturbs
me most now is stroke.

Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to churches or
Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to
instruct. I want a church or individual that will use this money to fund
churches, Orphanages and Widows. Also, the propagation of the work of God=
,
building and maintaining the house of God through this money, is very imp=
ortant.

The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I
took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this
money and my husband relatives are not Christians. I don?t want my husban=
d's
hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers, for their own selfish int=
erest
and in an ungodly manner. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I
am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. Exodus
14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace.=


I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my hea=
lth,
and because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me sometimes=
.
I don't want them to know about this development, but I know that With Go=
d
all things are possible.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Finan=
cial
institution in Ivory coast. I will also give you all information regardin=
g
the deposit of this money. I will also issue you a letter of authority th=
at
will empower you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you an=
d
your church to always pray for me because God work in misterious ways. My=

happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Who ever that wan=
ts
to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be pr=
ayerful
all through your life.

Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or chr=
istian
individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act acco=
rdingly
as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you soon.

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord. 

Yours in Christ,
Mrs Praise Uwaoma
