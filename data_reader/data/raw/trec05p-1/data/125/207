Guys,

In response to our strategic daily meeting, here is a list of items that we discussed and we need to be prepared to review.  Please think about these and we need to fill in your views. 

For EGM:

·	List the top uses of cash by business

·	List of cash generation items in each business

·	List of cash required unwind businesses and/or positions

·	Immediate action steps

·	What items would we get rid of if there weren't any balance sheet issues?

·	Is there $ in our trading books?

·	Is there extra $ in our receivables?

·	What assets or contracts that we could sell and how fast?  Are there fire sale issues and lost value vs. taking more time?

·	What should our businesses look like in a capital constrained or cash flow metric world (look 9 months ahead)?

·	List out key contracts per business unit.

·	List of what stays and what goes in each business

·	Money is stranded in our PRM and we have no access to the markets.  How could we get some of the value for our PRM? 


Thanks,
Mike
