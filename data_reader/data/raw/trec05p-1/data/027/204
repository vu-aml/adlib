Lorraine,

It was a pleasure to meet you yesterday and hear about your pipeline project.  As promised, I am sending you the name and number of the person that knows the other company here in Dallas that was looking at a site in the Gila Bend area.  I am also including the coordinates of our site so you can let us know if it is feasible to come to our plant.  I would appreciate it if you could let me know, as soon as you can, what that cost would be so we can run our economics on it.
