Will, due to the changing circumstances, the West and Canada have traders using multiple books, multiple regions for phys and Fin. Can we work around this or make a change that would not be too complicated?

Fran,

All deals from EOL are mapped to a desk in EnPower following these rules:

There cannot be more than one desk for any combination of
Trader
Region
Nature (Phys/Fin)

Therefore, you can have a trader with different books, so long as either the Region or Nature is different.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Will

Hi, Duong Luu and Will:

We are trying to add Tim Belden in EOL Adminstration (under Enpower) to be the Trader of "NETCO Long Term Southwest" after I have added him as the trader for "NETCO Long Term California",  but I kept getting below error message:

ORA-00001: unique constraint (PWR.PK_DEAL_DEFAULT_DESKS) violated


Is this because we cannot have any individual to be the trader of more than one west book?

Please advise. 

Thanks,

Fran
