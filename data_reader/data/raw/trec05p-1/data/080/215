There are two ENA contracts with Blue Dolphin - FT and IT and one for ENAU.  Were both of the contracts assigned?  In Global, the only contracts that show as assigned to AEP are  Global # 96032498 (ENA - FT) and Global #96063862 (ENAU - IT).  

The other contract Global#96037499 still shows as an active contract for ENA and the pipe continues to invoice us.

Taking into account that Global may be wrong, is there something that either of you have with the assigned global numbers so that we can get Global updated and notify the pipe?

Bob, 

Michael Olsen in Texas Logistics is receiving statements from Volume Mgmt for Blue Dolphin Pipeline.  Mike is fairly sure that Blue Dolphin went with HPL.  Is that correct or do we still have some business on it?
