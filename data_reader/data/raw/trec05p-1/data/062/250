<P>Kevin,</P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your patience in this matter. We always make sure to email you the best price on the right car. Unfortunately in the past we have been guilty of quick quotes, and the price was given immediately. However we found it isn't very helpful to quote our customers on the wrong car. That's why we just want to make sure you get the right price, so you can come buy the car without the hassle and avoid any confusion. 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I let you know earlier. We have a pricing philosophy in place to save you money and time. Depending on the vehicle you choose when you arrive on the lot our pricing is between 1% to 9% over wholesale. On a vehicle like the one you elected a 2001 Toyota Tundra AccessCab V8 4x4, you can purchase for 1% over wholesale. That number is $25,986.44 (including $2000 rebate good till 10/01/01) plus any tax, title and licensing fees. This includes the following options:</P><FONT color=#000000>
