NLRB MAY SOON EXPERIENCE MORE VACANCIES IF BUSH DOES NOT ACT

The five-member National Labor Relations Board, which has
been operating with one vacancy for almost a year, may soon
experience additional vacancies if President Bush does not
take action to keep current members in office and/or bring
in new members. The term of Peter J. Hurtgen (R), who joined
the board in November 1997 and was named chairman in May,
expires Aug. 27. He would then leave the board unless the
president nominates him for a second term or names him to a
recess appointment when Congress is not in session. Veteran
board official John C. Truesdale (D) had announced that he
will step down as a board member by Oct. 1, or earlier if
the Senate confirms a replacement or Bush wants to make a
recess appointment. After six months in office, Bush still
has not taken action to fill the vacant Republican seat and
replace Truesdale, which has allowed the board to continue
functioning with a majority of Democratic members.

Dennis P. Walsh (D), who was named to a recess appointment
by former President Clinton, will have to leave office when
Congress adjourns its 2001 session, which could occur as
early as October, unless Bush nominates him for a second
term and he is confirmed by the Senate. He cannot serve two
consecutive recess appointments. Member Wilma B. Liebman's
(D) term does not expire until Dec. 16, 2002. The fifth
board seat has been vacant since Aug. 27, 2000, when former
Member J. Robert Brame's (R) term expired. . . . Page AA-1

EMPLOYEE ARBITRATING COMMON LAW CLAIMS NOT SPARED
ARBITRATION FEES

A 1997 ruling by the D.C. Circuit exempting employees who
agree to arbitrate federal statutory claims from paying
certain arbitration fees does not extend to employees'
common law claims rooted in public policy, the D.C. Circuit
rules ("Brown v. Wheat First Securities Inc.,  "D.C. Cir.,
No. 00-7171,  7/31/01).

Judge Williams declines to extend the holding in "Cole v.
Burns International Security Services" and upholds an
arbitrator's order requiring Ronald L. Brown to pay $6,365
in arbitration costs on his claims for wrongful termination,
breach of implied contract, defamation, slander, and
tortious interference against Wheat First Securities Inc.
"In short, the proposed extension of "Cole" would
significantly alter the terms of the Federal Arbitration
Act, imposing a serious procedural limit on a wide (but
unpredictable) range of arbitration claims, all without the
slightest signal from Congress," the appeals court
concludes. . . . Page A-7

FIRING UNIONIST DAD WHO LEFT WORK EARLY WAS NOT ULP, SPLIT
NLRB SAYS

A New York automobile dealer did not violate federal labor
law by discharging a parts department employee, who was a
union member, for leaving the job early after an emergency
call from his 13-year-old son, a divided NLRB rules ("Tom
Rice Buick, Pontiac & GMC Truck Inc., "334 NLRB No. 91,
7/26/01).

Tom Rice Buick of Huntington, N.Y., "met its burden of
proving that it would have terminated [Thomas] Fell even in
the absence of his union activity, because he closed the
parts department and left work early, without notice to or
permission from management, and in spite of knowing that a
customer needed parts department services," Chairman Hurtgen
and Member Truesdale write.

Dissenting Member Liebman would have found a violation of
Section 8(a) of the National Labor Relations Act. The
discharge decision, shortly after an unlawful discussion of
Fell's union membership, amounted to "severe, "unlawfully
motivated " punishment of a man put in a tough spot, seeking
to do the right thing for his child," she observes. . . .

SENATE COMMITTEE OKS MEASURE TO RENEW, EXPAND MENTAL HEALTH
PARITY

The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee
approves a bill to extend and expand the 1996 law that
requires group health plans offering mental health benefits
to make those benefits available on a equal basis with
benefits for physical health care.

The committee votes 21-0 to approve the Mental Health
Equitable Treatment Act of 2001 (S. 543), sponsored by Sens.
Wellstone (D-Minn.) and Domenici (D-N.M.), which would
extend and expand the 1996 mental health parity law that is
set to expire Sept. 30. Although the committee vote was
unanimous, several members indicated they plan to bring
amendments when the measure moves to the Senate floor. The
committee also approves an amendment that would exempt
companies with 50 or fewer employees.

The bill would provide for full parity for all categories of
mental health conditions in the "Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth edition (DSM IV-TR)". The
1996 law, by contrast, defined mental health benefits as
those "defined under the terms of the plan or coverage." . .

PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ORDERS CHRISTIAN COALITION NOT TO
RETALIATE

A federal judge in Washington, D.C., issues a preliminary
injunction ordering the Christian Coalition of America not
to retaliate against nine African American current and
former employees who are suing for race discrimination ("Lee
v. Christian Coalition of Am. Inc., " D.D.C.,  No. 01-0405,
7/27/01).

In what he describes as an issue of first impression, Judge
Urbina says that without the injunction, the low-paid
employees might be irreparably harmed by having to go on
welfare during the course of the litigation. "This is
precisely the type of relief that cannot be remedied at the
end of this litigation," he writes. The coalition strongly
denies the charges and has already filed an appeal in the
D.C. Circuit, according to its attorney. . . . Page A-3
