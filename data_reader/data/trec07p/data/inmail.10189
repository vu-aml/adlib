Making news today...

* A new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. taken April 10-12 finds the race for the presidential nomination is tightening up in
both parties, with both frontrunners losing some ground since early March.

In a GOP race featuring Newt Gingrich and Fred Thompson, Rudy Giuliani leads John McCain by just 3 percentage points
(27%-24%).  In that scenario, Thompson places third (11%), Romney fourth (10%), and Gingrich fifth (8%).

On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton now holds an eight-point advantage over Barack Obama (36%-28%) when Al Gore is
not included in the race. John Edwards scores 15% without Gore.

* Vice President Cheney spoke about Iraq on CBS' "Face the Nation":

"Now, it's tough... it's a very difficult assignment, but we've got a new commander in the field, we've got a good
strategy in place, and I think we will see positive results."

* Today on CNN's American Morning, Presidential Candidate John Edwards disagreed:

"The surge is not working. [It's] absolutely clear that the surge is, in fact, failing. The attack on the Iraqi
parliament inside the Green Zone is clear evidence of that."

The full interview will be posted on The Ticker later today.

* Much has been made about the Hollywood primary, who the stars are backing for president. Among the bold-faced names
in the official Q1 FEC filings:

Elizabeth Taylor, Chevy Chase, Candice Bergen, Michael Spielas, and Don Henley gave Hillary Clinton the legal maximum,
$4600.

Zach Braff, Morgan Freeman, Dennis Haysbert, and Tobey Maguire each gave Barack Obama $2300.  Tom Hanks and the Dixie
Chicks' Natalie Maines maxed out with $4600 each.

And some celebrities, like Barbra Streisand and Steven Spielberg, couldn't decide on just one candidate, so they gave
to at least three.

Check back to the Ticker later this morning to see who in Tinsletown is opening their wallets for '08 candidates.

* And despite the emergence of 24-hour cable news and the Internet, FEWER Americans can now name the VPOTUS vs. two
decades ago.  69% can name Cheney in a new Pew poll, while 74% could name Dan Quayle in 1989.  How many could name
their Governor?  The Speaker of the House?  Find out in Hot Topics below!

Obama calls for "diplomatic surge" in Iraq

ATLANTA (CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) invoked the names of civil rights leaders and criticized the war in Iraq at a
political rally Saturday in Atlanta.

"When ordinary people have stood up, extraordinary things have happened." the Democratic presidential candidate
declared before an audience of more than 10,000 assembled on the Georgia Tech campus.

The Illinois senator told the audience that the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. had described the Vietnam War as "morally
untenable" in comments he made not far from the site of this rally. And Obama said that while parallels between Vietnam
and Iraq were not precise, he added, "We don't engage in war because it's a sport."

He received some of his loudest applause discussing the war, saying "It's time for us to start bringing our combat
troops home. We don't want to see Iraq completely collapse into bloodshed."

He added, "We've got national security concerns that we've got to tend to, but we are not going to solve the problem by
sending another hundred billion dollars every year, and sending thousands of more troops to come back injured.	There's
no military solution to the problems that we have in Iraq at this point... we need a diplomatic surge."

Before the speech, civil rights legend Joseph Lowery told the crowd, "We've heard a voice crying in the political
wilderness, and the sound we believe offers promise of policy and practices that can hasten the healing and wind down
the war."

Lowery marched across the Pettus Bridge with Obama last month in Selma, Alabama. Lowery has not officially endorsed
anyone in the campaign, but spoke glowingly of Obama's candidacy.

"My presence indicated the direction my heart is leaning," he told CNN. Lowery said the time may not right for an
official endorsement, but "my presence there ought to be enough to satisfy those who look for formal endorsements."

Obama described the Selma event in his speech as "a solemn moment for me." But Obama said he believed the meaning of
the day was lost on some people in the nation's capital.

"When I returned back to Washington, I met some of these folks who see politics only as a matter of lobbyists, checks
and special interests," Obama said. "Some of them kind of patted me on the back, and they said that was very nice
celebration of African-American history. And I looked at a couple of these folks, and I said, 'No, no. You don't
understand. That was a celebration of American history.'"

"CONGRESS WILL PASS CLEAN LEGISLATION," SAYS CHENEY ON "FACE": Despite the conviction of his former chief of staff in a
high-profile trial, Vice President Dick Cheney said today that he has not had an opportunity to speak to his friend, I.
Lewis "Scooter" Libby, the highest-ranking official of the Bush administration to be convicted of federal crimes.
During an appearance on CBS' Face the Nation, the vice president also said he expects the Democratic-led Congress will
eventually relent in its demand that future funding for the Iraq war be tied with a timetable for withdrawal. "I think
the Congress will pass clean legislation," Cheney said. "I don't think that the majority of the Democrats in Congress
want to leave America's fighting forces in harm's way without the resources they need to defend themselves." CBS News:

"I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE," GONZALES WILL TELL SENATORS: Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales offered a measured apology
for his mistakes in the dismissal of eight United States attorneys, but said in testimony prepared for a Senate hearing
on Tuesday that he had "nothing to hide" and that none of the prosecutors were removed to influence the outcome of a
case. In his testimony, which was released Sunday by the Justice Department, Mr. Gonzales provided an account of his
actions that was largely consistent with his past assertions that his role was very limited and his recollection
fragmentary. Mr. Gonzales said that he did not select any of the prosecutors slated for dismissal last year and that he
largely delegated the effort to his former chief of staff, D. Kyle Sampson. "I have nothing to hide," he said in his
testimony, "and I am committed to assuring the Congress and the American public that nothing improper occurred here."

DOJ'S BATTLE CONTRADICTS A.G.: The former Justice Department official who carried out the firings of eight U.S.
attorneys last year told Congress that several of the prosecutors had no performance problems and that a memo on the
firings was distributed at a Nov. 27 meeting attended by Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, a Democratic senator
said yesterday. The statements to House and Senate investigators by Michael A. Battle, former director of the Executive
Office for U.S. Attorneys, represent another potential challenge to the credibility of Gonzales, who has said that he
never saw any documents about the firings and that he had "lost confidence" in the prosecutors because of performance
problems. Battle's statements, relayed to reporters yesterday by Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), came as Gonzales
prepares for a make-or-break appearance on Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Washington Post: Ex-Justice
Official's Statements Contradict Gonzales on Firings

WOLFOWITZ VOWS TO STAY ON AT WORLD BANK: World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz rejected calls to resign even after a
panel representing the governments that fund the agency rebuked him for a decision to promote his girlfriend. "I
believe in the mission of this organization, and I believe I can carry it out," Wolfowitz, 63, told a press conference
in Washington yesterday. "This is important work, and I intend to continue it." World Bank directors are weighing
Wolfowitz's future after finding that he personally dictated the terms of his partner's salary increase and promotion.
The raise was twice as large as allowed by bank rules, according to the Staff Association, which represents 13,000
employees and is demanding Wolfowitz resign. Minutes before Wolfowitz spoke, the Development Committee, which
represents the 185 member nations of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, issued a statement saying "the
current situation is of great concern to all of us." Bloomberg: Wolfowitz Rejects Calls to Quit; Panel Cites 'Great
Concern' http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&sid=ahU2BJvPstH4

DCCC'S "FRONTLINERS" RAISE CASH AT "FRANTIC PACE": Freshman House Democrats, buoyed by the new majority their victories
ushered in, raked in campaign money at an almost frantic pace in the first three months of the off-election year,
showed fundraising tallies for the most vulnerable among them. According to a tabulation by the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, the 29 Members of the DCCC's "Frontline" program — which directs funds to the party's
most endangered incumbents — raised an average of $291,000 in the first three months of 2007. That reflects more than a
$100,000 jump from the average the Frontline members raised in the first quarter of 2005. There also are almost three
times as many Members in the program this cycle, due to the Democratic victories in last year's midterm elections that
netted the party 30 seats and control of the House. Roll Call: Frontliners Get Quick Cash Start

GOP CANDIDATES STILL WANT HELP FROM FUNDRAISER-IN-CHIEF: President Bush may be unpopular inside the Beltway, but to
Republicans nationwide, he remains the fundraiser extraordinaire, and he is expected to pull in more than $200 million
for Republican candidates by Election Day 2008. Although his approval rating hovers in the 30s, between 70 percent and
80 percent of Republicans support his policies, including the "surge" of troops to secure Baghdad. Even though the next
elections are 20 months away, the growing partisanship and polarization makes the president an even bigger draw for
campaign cash... Mr. Bush "remains interested in helping the party, interested in helping candidates," said Sara
Taylor, White House political director. "I anticipate that he would be on par or ahead of where he was in the last
off-year. He very likely will be ahead of it." Washington Times: Bush in demand to fill war chests

OFFICIAL Q1 NUMBERS IN: Hillary Rodham Clinton banked a daunting $24 million for the Democratic presidential campaign
at the end of the first quarter even as rival Barack Obama outraised her in a display of fundraising prowess. Clinton,
the senator from New York, raised $19 million for the primary election, trailing Obama, who collected $24.8 million in
donations for the primary. Obama reported $18.2 million cash on hand for the primary, keeping him at Clinton's heels as
the presidential campaign enters a more intense second quarter. The first quarter financial reports established Clinton
and Obama as the undisputed money leaders of the Democratic field, a significant but not determining factor in
politics. The reports also show that as a group, Democratic presidential candidates outraised Republicans by a margin
of eight to five. AP via Yahoo! News: Clinton has $24 million for primudles

CANDIDATES TAKING CUES FROM THE IDEOLOGICAL BASES: Five months after midterm elections that demonstrated the rising
power of independent voters, conservative and liberal activists continue to drive the presidential campaign dialogue,
deepening the red-blue divisions that have defined national politics for more than a decade. The huge gulf between the
two parties' candidates is most evident on Iraq -- a division reinforced last week by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who
excoriated his Democratic rivals on the war. The top Republican contenders uniformly support President Bush's troop
buildup strategy; Democrats just as forcefully argue for starting to withdraw U.S. troops and a timetable for eventual
removal of virtually all combat forces... On issues such as taxes and spending, health care, and education, candidates
are mostly taking their cue from -- or trying to cozy up to -- their respective ideological bases. Washington Post:
Candidates Still Take Cues From Their Base

NO FAVORITE FOR EVANGELICALS: Evangelical Christians have long been a key constituency for the Republican Party, but
leading religious conservatives are expressing dissatisfaction with the party's current crop of presidential
candidates... Eight years ago, Christian conservative stalwarts Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes sought the Republican
nomination in a presidential field led from start to finish by Mr. Bush, who proudly proclaimed his born-again faith.
Each of the three Republicans most often mentioned as front-runners for the 2008 presidential nomination -- Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney -- present
significant problems to evangelical voters, said Mr. Olasky, a University of Texas professor and Christian journalist.

69% CAN NAME THE VEEP: Americans' knowledge of national and international affairs has changed little in two decades
despite the emergence of 24-hour cable news and the Internet as major news sources. People surveyed in February were
slightly less able than those polled in 1989 to name the vice president, their state's governor and the president of
Russia but slightly more able to answer other questions correctly about national politics, according to a poll released
Sunday by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. Of the 1,502 adults survey in February, 69 percent
correctly answered Dick Cheney when asked who was the vice president, compared with 74 percent who correctly responded
Dan Quayle when the same question was asked in 1989. Two-thirds correctly named their state's governor in February
compared with three-fourths who got that right in 1989. AP via Yahoo! News: Knowledge unchanged by new news outlets
