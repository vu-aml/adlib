PGE Telephony Services has scheduled routine maintenance work on the voice mail system for this upcoming Friday.  
The voice mailboxes will not be accessible and will not record messages during the scheduled time, but will hold the messages that are already stored for future use.

Please feel free to contact Dave Steiner or myself if you have any questions or concerns.
