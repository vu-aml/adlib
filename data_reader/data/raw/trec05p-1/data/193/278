Tracey,

I received a phone call yesterday from  Mika Aswell (spelling?) from Lea County, NM.  Her county office has received a check from Transwestern and she does not know how to apply it.  Here is what we know:

	Amount:	$7.36
	Check Date:  	December 17, 2001
	Invoice Date:	1-1-2001	#676-3004-0
	Voucher:	0100001479
	Purchase Order:	A60KD13882

Mika's phone number is (505)396-8534.

Can you please track this down and tell me or Mika how to apply this money.

Many thanks, 
Kim X33098
