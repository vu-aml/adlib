Louise,

Am working with the Marks to resolve our issues. I have a feeling this email of a few days ago may come up now or in the future, so here is a copy if you ever need it.

The email covers the use of www.ubswenergy.com and the "conditions" around it.

Dave

Hi Dave / Kal

Looks like we can use the ubswenergy.com domain name for a few months 
then integrate you guys into the ubswarburg policies over time.  Can 
you send back an email confirming that this works for you.  I think 
this is the best compromise we can reach for the moment which allows us 
to not waste any more time in discussions! 

thx
Ursula

Stuart

Following our conversation this morning I just want to confirm what we 
have agreed. 

Pat - please can you read through the points below and send Stuart an 
e-mail confirming that you agree with everything, particularly the 
'Conditions' section, and that all the UBS Warburg Energy staff will 
comply with the conditions as laid out below.

Decisions:
=======
1) The brand name for the new trading entity that we are acquiring from 
Enron will be UBS Warburg Energy. 

2) The domain name will be www.ubswenergy.com and we will also point, 
but not market, various other domain names to the site, eg 
www.ubsenergy.com, www.ubswarburgenergy.com

3) The new entity will follow all UBS Warburg corporate identity rules 
in terms of font, imagery and colour usage for all printed and online 
material.

Conditions:
========
1) That in 6 months' time (week beginning 29 July 2002) our position is 
reviewed. If this venture is successful and we plan to continue with 
it, the branding position will change and the entity will be fully 
incorporated into UBS Warburg and any changes necessary with regard to 
branding will be made.

2) The domain name will change, will follow corporate guidelines and 
will follow the format of www.ubswarburg.com/energy (where the 
'/energy' part can be discussed in order to ensure the most appropriate 
name is used.

3) All printed material will be changed to reflect the change in brand 
which therefore means that any material produced immediately will have 
a relatively short shelf-life as it may have to be re-printed.
