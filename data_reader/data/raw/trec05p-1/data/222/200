An old man and his wife have gone to bed.  After laying there a few
minutes the old man farts and says, "Seven Points."

His wife rolls over and says, "What in the world was that?"  The old
man replied, "It's fart football."

A few minutes later the wife lets one go and says, "Touchdown, tie
score."

After about five minutes the old man farts again and says,  "Touchdown,
I'm ahead 14 to 7."

Not to be out done the wife rips another one and says, "Touchdown,  tie

score."

Five seconds go by and she lets out a squeaker and says, "Fieldgoal,  I

lead 17 to 14."

Now the pressures on and the old man refuses to get beat by a woman  so
he strains real hard but to no avail. Realizing a defeat is totally
unacceptable he gives it everything he has but instead of farting he
poops in the bed.

The wife looks and says, "What the hell was that?"

The old man replied, "Half-time, Switch sides."
