After a days hard work,and straining limbs all one longs for 
is an extra special comfort sleep that refreshes one for the day next....

Isnt it an irony, that something like "A GOOD SLEEP" which is the most important 
to a man's life and which is what we spend 30% of our lives doing,
is something we care the least about! 
The primary requirement to a good sleep is a good bed,
and the primary requirement for a good bed 
are soft,supple, clean and crisp sheets.

If you are now worrying about finding a sheet 
to caress your body...
you dont need to WORRY anymore!

THE ALTERNATIVE - ORGANIC COTTON

Certified organic cotton is cotton grown in fields 
where the use of pesticides have been discontinued 
for at least 3 years and where rigorous controls help 
rebuild the soil's natural fertility. 
Organic farming is a farming system which relies on natural inputs only.
No synthetically produced pesticides or fertilizers are used. 
Mother Nature is allowed to have much more of an influence. 
Beneficial insects are allowed to flourish to keep pest insects in check.

No more paying royal prices to experience a royal sleep! 
All our speciality linens are made from 
100% Egyptian cotton handpicked for the best buds.
