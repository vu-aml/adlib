Hi Solmaz,

for questions about BioConductor packages (such as limma or limmaGUI)  
youre probably better off asking in the BioConductor forum. I  
recommend you subscribe to it, it압 very much microarray-oriented and  
I았e learnt a lot there.

Now, about your question... I haven앖 used limmaGUI for a long time (I  
switched to teh command line limma instead, more flexible), but I았e  
dealt with similar problems as you describe, both my own and others...  
I can앖 tell you what youre problem is, but I앏l give you a couple of  
ideas so hopefully you can check and maybe one of them gives you a  
solution.

Well, first of all, I앐 concerned that you say you have no GAL file.  
The GAL file describes what압 on the array, the locations of teh spots  
etc... and limmaGUI *requires* a GAL file, as far as I remember... so  
you won앖 get far without one!
However, you say you gave GenePix files (GPR), so you could make your  
own, as each GPR file will contain the minimal info that you need in a  
GAL file: the columns with headers "block", "row", "column", "ID" and  
"Name".

The error reading the GPR files, was usually (when I encounter it) due  
to non-standard headers in teh files. If you select "GenePix" as your  
type of data file to load, by default it expects to find a column with  
the header "F532 Median" and "F635 Median" as teh source of raw  
intensity readings for the Cy3 and teh Cy5 channels respectively. But  
depending on the settings of Genepix when teh scanning was made, and  
when the quantitation was calculated, you may have a different  
wavelength (maybe 685 instead of 635, etc)... so limmaGUI cannot find  
teh right columns and returns an error. You should open all your GPR  
files (in Excel, for instance... GPR is just a standard text file, in  
tab-delimited format) and check what teh headers say. Take note of them.
If teh headers are not the same in all files, you앏l get errors.
To read GPR files with a different header than teh default, you can  
simply use teh generic option ("Other", from teh menu of file  
formats). This opens a little window where you specify teh actual  
cl靭mn names to load from teh files. "Rf" means "Red Foreground"  
(usually Cy5 channel), "Rb" is "Red backgrund", and similarly you get  
to specify teh column names for "Gf" and "Gb". So, say you could write  
"F650 Median" in the "Rf" slot, and this tells limmaGUI to take that  
column you specified as teh source for the signals for teh Cy5  
channel. "B650 Median" on the slot "Rb" then specifies that column  
from the GPR files as teh background for Cy5 channel... etc.

I앇 say the reason above is the most likely to solve the problem.  
However, I have also seen instances where some GPR files had been  
modified to omit any empty spots, for example. This results in having  
files containing different numbers of genes, and this returns errors.  
So make sure all teh files have teh right number of rows, and that the  
GAL file has teh same number of rows too, and in the same order!

I hope this helps a bit... and do check the BioConductor forum, it is  
a great place to ask this sort of questions, especially as you are  
more likely to get answers directly from teh guys who developed the  
packages themselves.

Good luck!

Jose
