I reviewed a previous list and sent a response to Danette related to IM access last month.  See my previous memo attached.  See also my previous request for additional information sent today.  I don't think the role requested below for Kim allows movement of budget dollars in IM, but have asked for a definition to clarify the role.

Thanks,  Elaine

I will approve.  However, I feel there are too many operations people with access to move budget dollars around.  Please review list from Danette Campbell and let me know who I can delete.

Thanks

Danette,
I am fine with the Operations Capital Coordinators who require access.  I cannot speak to the other functions, but I didn't see anyone on the list for the FN IM CAPITAL BUDGET APPROVER or FN IM CAPITAL BUDGET CONTROLLER from Operations that should be removed.  I didn't see any Operations people for the other roles that should be removed either.

Operations Capital Coordinators:
Diane Gotto
Elizabeth Jameson
Pallavi Goradia (as supervisor)
Stephanie Bertch
Talbert Loyd
Robert Geheb
Sapana Patel (as backup)

All of these people need to be able to enter the Capital Budget into IM, move dollars in IM and release from IM.

Thanks,  Elaine

We still have not had a response from you on the roles assigned below.  Please let me know if we should be contacting someone else or if this is no longer your responsibility.  Our security audit has begun and the auditors are requesting documentation on the signoff from the business units.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thank you!
