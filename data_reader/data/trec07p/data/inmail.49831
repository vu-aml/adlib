I am almost certain that the following code is in list context.

pugs> my @a = '-' x 5, 'foo', '-' x 5;
pugs> @a
("-----", "foo", "-----")
pugs> my @b = cat('-' xx 5), 'foo', cat('-' xx 5)
("-", "-", "-", "-", "-", "foo", "-", "-", "-", "-", "-")

However, it does seem that Pug's version of cat does not handle the
Str emulation, so that may fix it, but I don't see how it could since
(at least in my mind) the code above is in list context.
