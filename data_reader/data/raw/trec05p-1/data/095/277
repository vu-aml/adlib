Dr. Lay,

I just wanted to write to apologize on behalf of whomever sent you those hostile questions.  Even though we have some reasons to be angry, we do not have 
an excuse to be rude or disrespectful, specially to you.  I wanted you to know that those acts do not reflect the sentiments of the majority of Enron Employees. We are embarrassed that you even had to address the question on the first place.  Please accept this apology and we hope to have you around for a long time, your words of encouragement really makes a difference, thank you.

Best regards,

Adriana Wynn
