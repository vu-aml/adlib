Strange inquiries from G7 Group, one of our FX consultants.  The word among their clients is that Enron is liquidating positions and that that is affecting Eurodollar trading.  I know that some of their top clients are Moore Capital, Tudor Capital, and Goldman Sachs.

Just thought you'd want to know.
