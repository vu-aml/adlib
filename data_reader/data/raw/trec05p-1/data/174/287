It appears that the fax you moved in on the 33rd floor was actively being used by Scott Tholan and his assistant on that floor (x58889).  Can your people please move it back ASAP and find us another one.  Thanks.

The analog lines are tagged right on the user end of the cord with yellow stickies with their extension numbers written on them as you'd asked. 

I'll have you the fax numbers in a couple minutes. 

I'm out of the office for a couple of hours.

I can't tell the fax numbers on some of the faxes and where the analog lines are.  Can you meet with me?
