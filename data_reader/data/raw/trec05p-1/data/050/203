Hello,

Here is the consolidated list as it stands tonight (See tab "Bankruptcies").  We have not received the updated EES schedule, so some of the EES information may be outdated.  Also, it is not updated for PG&E.  Please review and let me know if you have more current information on any of these bankruptcies and/or if they have been resolved.  In addition, please check for completeness.

Thanks,

Becky,

I have not added all the bankruptcies from your database download because you mentioned that many are probably resolved.  Will you give me a call on Friday to talk about the best way to determine whether these old ones have been resolved?

Thanks again,

Sharon
