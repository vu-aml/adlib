I entered it last night as a new deal in your book.  There was origination granted for this deal out of your book too.  Give me a call at 39185 (my phone is not working) or I can some up there.

I see now in Sitara that you booked it to ENA-IM WC CAL.  Should I change it to that in TAGG?

Ashley,

There's a changed deal in my book with Counterparty City of Pasadena.  I believe I originally input the deal to go to Mike's book, which is the correct book.  It appears that maybe you changed it thinking it was a mistake.  ??
