Dear Vince
 
Further to my telephone conversation with Shirley,  I am writing concerning the GARP 2002 Convention, which will be held in New York  on 12-13 February. I have set a new deadline for the presentational slides,  Friday 4th January, and would like to touch base with you about  this. Your two areas of participation are:
 
1. a 40 minute presentation in 12th February on  Measuring energy risk - tackling price volatility, adapting VAR,  scenario modelling and regulatory requirements
 
2. co-presenting a one-day workshop on energy risk  management with Mark Williams on 14 February. I have attached a copy of the  brochure for your information.
 
I have also attached a hotel booking form, since I  am unsure whether this was sent to you.
 
Please keep me informed as to your progress, though  I hope to receive the presentational slides by January 4. If there are any  difficulties or questions please do not hesitate to contact me.
 
Kind regards
 
Andreas
