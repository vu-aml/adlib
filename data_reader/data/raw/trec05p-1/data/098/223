Hey Jeff,

Have you heard about my idea to trade ags with my black box model?

Rick,

As you know we have stopped our agricultural commodity businesses, and therefore do not need any VAR associated with these businesses.  If this VAR is allocated to EGM, I would like to reallocate it within the business unit.  If VAR is approved for specific businesses, EGM will give this VAR back to Corp.

As well, I would like to reclass all softs, grains, and meats on the DPR as "other" and remove those headings.

Thanks

Jeff
