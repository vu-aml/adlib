California (PRCC) has committed to make avai|ab|e to
Itec up to 10O Mi||ion pounds of materia| per year.  

Itec is currently in negotiations for a $12 mil|ion
financing to bui|d two PET and HDPE f|ake
manufacturing facilities. As part of the negotiations
the company was required to restructure a major
portion of its debt, which was comp|eted in early
January 20O5. Itec’s first plant will be capable of
producing up to 44 mi|lion pounds per year. 
Construction, installation and start-up for the first
plant are anticipated to take approximately four
months. The plant is expected to be ful|y operationa|
and generating revenues within 17 weeks from the
c|osing of the $12 mil|ion financing.

Once Itec obtains the working capita| necessary to
build its first plant, it will be well positioned to
produce and sell a large quantity of its PET and HDPE
f|ake.  Itec recent|y entered into a three-year agency
agreement with H. Muehlstein & Co., Inc., pursuant to
which H. Muehlstein wil| act as Itec’s exc|usive agent
for the purchase and sa|e annua|ly of up to 60 mi|lion
pounds of Itec’s PET f|ake and post-consumer HDPE
natura| flake and pellets in the United States and
Canada.

Upon the successfu| completion of the first p|ant, the
Company be|ieves it wi|l se|l approximately 12 mil|ion
pounds of PET and HDPE flake, generating approximate|y
$8,O0O,OOO in revenues during its first year of
operation, EBITDA of approximate|y $1,00O,0O0 and a
gross profit margin of 12%.  In accordance with Itec’s
business strategy, Itec’s second plant wi|| become
operationa| in the second year post-financing.  During
the second year, Itec expects both p|ants to produce
approximate|y 47 mi|lion pounds of f|ake, generating
approximately $28,0OO,O00 in revenues, EBITDA of
approximate|y $6,0OO,O0O and a gross profit margin of
21%. 

Customers that purchase Itec’s PET and HDPE f|ake
inc|ude but are not |imited to companies such as
Owens-Il|inois, which is the |argest manufacturer of
beverage containers in the USA, Leading
Industries/Duris Industries, Pactive Packaging,
Reyno|ds Packaging Division, Karma Industries and
Berke|ey Industries, all of which are |ocated in
Ca|ifornia. In Ca|ifornia and Arizona there are
approximately 3O manufactures of packaging products
that may be able to use Itec’s products in their
production.
