Mr=2E Chukwubiko Anthony
Gulf Bank of Nigeria  Plc

I am a staff of  First Bank of Nigeria Plc=2E I am writing
following an oppurtunity in my office that will be of immense benefit =

to both of us=2E In my department we discovered an  abandoned sum of =

=2420=2E5million United State Dollars(Twenty million five hundred thousan=
d =

United State Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign =

customers Late Mr=2E Morris Thompson an American  who unfortunately lost =

his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed =

on January 31 2000=2C including his wife and only daughter=2E
You shall read more  about the crash on visiting this site=2E
http=3A//www=2Ecnn=2Ecom/2000/US/02/01/alaska=2Eairlines=2Elist/
and http=3A//www=2Enativefederation=2Eorg/history/people/mThompson=2Ehtml=
Since =

we got information about  his death=2C we have
been expecting his next of kin or relatves to come over and claim his =

money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as =

next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking =

guidelines=2EUnfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being =

his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody =

with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim=2E It is therefore =

upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department =

now decided to make  business with you and release the money to you as =

the next of kin or  beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and =

subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don=92t want=
 =

this money to go back into  Government treasury as unclaimed bill=2EThe =

banking law and guidelines here stipulates that such money remained =

after five years the money will be transferred into banking treasury as =

unclaimed funds=2E We agreed that 30=25 of this money will be for you as =

foreign partner=2C while the balance will be for me and my colleagues=2E =
I =

will visit your country for the disbursement according to the =

percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account=2E  =

Please be honest to me and trust is our watchword in this transaction=2E =


Note this transaction is confidential and  risk free=2E =

As soon as you receive this mail you should contact me by return =

mail=2EPlease note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release =

of these funds to you has been finalised=2E We will discuss much in =

details when I do receive your response=2E

Please in your response include your telephone number
for easy communication between us=2E
Best regards
Mr=2E Chukwubiko Anthony
