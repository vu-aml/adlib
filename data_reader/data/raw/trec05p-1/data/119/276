Mr. Lay,

I realize that during these particularly tough times that you probably will not have the time to read this. In addition, I presume that you have received a high volume of notes from your employees regarding the issues of the day. I do hope, however, that you will take a moment to consider my thoughts and to step back from today's headlines and consider all of the tremendous opportunities that you have given all of your employees over the past 16 years. Your vision and hard work has accomplished more than just a business; it has provided many thousands of families support and structure. 

I moved to Houston last year to continue my EBS career. I am over 52 years old with a career in telecommunications sales and sales management. I continue to be excited about EBS opportunities; even though the rumors have us eliminated. The industry will improve. Our time should be spent cultivating future business relationships and becoming a fixture at the prospective counter parties' decision table. Anyway, my decision to move to Houston rather than to accept an ATT Natl Accounts Mngr continues to be the correct move in my opinion. I must admit that if EBS goes down; I will be in a very difficult position (at my age) to find another position; but the point is this...I do not want to work for any other company other than Enron. I made a commitment to EBS two years ago; and I have not swayed. I want to continue to work as a midmarketer for Enron and I thank you for your commitment to me and your other employees at Enron.
