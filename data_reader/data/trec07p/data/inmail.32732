For text-based graphics formats, you can just use diff;  for raster
formats, you can do per pixel comparisons.  These days there is
ImageMagick to do a compare and it will even produce an image of the
difference.  I have an old package called graphicsQC (not on CRAN) that
implemented some of these ideas (there was a talk at DSC 2003, see
http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/index.html).  A student worked on a
much better approach more recently, but I haven't put that up on the web
yet.  Let me know if you'd like to take a look at the newer package (it
would help to have somebody nagging me to get it finished off).
