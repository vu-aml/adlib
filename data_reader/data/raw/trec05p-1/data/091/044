Todd,

Please look into the above.  This company has a $5.4mm current federal tax expense that has never been booked to the G/L.  I think it has something to do w/ the fact that the entity maintenance screen shows UNK for type of entity & domestic/foreign.  This is a Domestic Division of 364.  You will probably have to coordinate w/ Kathy to ensure the YTD figure for CFIT gets booked.

Please make sure this gets corrected for next month.

Thanks
Joey E
