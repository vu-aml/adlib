From Mr.John Obi
Branch Manager,
United Bank For Africa Plc
Ilupeju branch, Lagos Nigeria

Dear Sir/Madam

I am pleased to get across to you for a very urgent and profitable
business proposal, though I don't know you neither have I seen you before
but my confidence was reposed on you when the Chief Executive of Lagos
State chamber of Commerce and Industry handed me your contact for a
confidential business. I am the manager of United Bank for Africa Plc
(UBA), Ilupeju branch, Lagos Nigeria. The intended business is thus; We
had a customer, a Foreign resident in Nigeria, he was a Contractor with
one of the Government Parastatals. He has in his Account in my branch the
sum ofUS 15.5 Million (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U.S
{Dollars).Unfortunately, the man died three years ago until today non-of
his next of kin has come forward to claim the money. Having noticed this,

I in collaboration with two other top Officials of the bank have covered
up the account all this while. Now we want you (being a foreigner) to be
fronted as one of his next of kin and forward your account and other
relevant documents to be advised to you by us to attest to the Claim. We
will use our positions to get all internal documentations to back up the
claims. The whole procedures will last only five working days to get the
fund retrieved successfully without trace even now or in future. Your
response is only what we are waiting for as we have arranged all necessary
things.

As soon as this message comes to you kindly get back to me indicating your
interest, then I will furnish you with the whole procedures to ensure that
the deal is successfully concluded. For your assistance we have agreed to
give you twenty five percent (25%) of the Total sum at the end of the
transaction while 65% would be for my colleagues and I and the remaining
10% would be for any form of expenses that may be incurred during the
course of the transaction which would be given to us when the money is
transferred into your account before splitting the balance on the agreed
percentage of 65% to 25%. In order to get all the legal documents from the
court, kindly send the following information to us immediately. Your full
name, telephone, mobile and fax numbers as well as your resident or
company address. I await your earliest response.

Thanks,

Yours Sincerely,

Mr.John Obi
