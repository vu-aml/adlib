IMPORTANT TIPS TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS AT Match.com: 

If you use the "reply" button to respond to this message, please take the following steps:

1.  DELETE ALL TEXT from the body of your message, including header information which may include your actual email address.

2.  REMOVE ANY AUTOMATIC SIGNATURES which may include your personal contact information.

Our anonymous re-mailer will strip away your real email address (in the From: field), so that it will NOT appear in the "From:" line. However, DO NOT use the "Cc:" or "Bcc:" fields as these addresses CANNOT be stripped away.
