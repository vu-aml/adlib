You should have no problem running Linux on a mac.  With the intel
chip in the new mac, just boot a live cd or install a conventional
distro and you should be on your way.  If the drivers for the mac
hardware are too different, though, from those for hardware under
x-86, you might encounter some trouble there.  I have never tried it,
but I don't see that you should have any trouble with it.  



Hope this helps.
