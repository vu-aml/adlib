Do you wanna know what the cops said one time when we called them to report
people who had broken into a (nice) empty home, and who were living there,
while also stealing all the personal belongings left by the former
residents, in addition to ripping off the fireplace mantle and any other
saleable items?
After refusing to go inside the building to get the bums, the cop said,
"Homeless people need a place to sleep, too."   !!!
