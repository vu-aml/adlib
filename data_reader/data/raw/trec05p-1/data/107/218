While you may have read in the Change Control email sent today from the ETS Solution Center, we have some changes on the 41st floor scheduled for this weekend during the maintenance window.  While we do not expect any problems with this maintenance window, we need to make sure we have a plan in place to not impact the customers. 

This Saturday night,  October 27, starting at 10:30 pm fiber maintenance will be performed in the wiring closet on EB41.  During this maintenance window the jacket that covers and protects the fiber will be pulled back tight and secured.  This fiber connects the 41st floor wiring closet with the server room on 41, where the TMS servers are located.   While we do not expect this maintenance to have any impact, if we do have any issues with the fiber it can be replaced within an estimated 2 hour window.  Outage impact would then be lose of connectivity with the Enron LAN from that server room, therefore TMS would be unavailable.  

At 10:30 pm on Saturday night, Mark Cowley from the server team will contact the HotTap Helpdesk to get approval to start the maintenance window.  The maintenance window will not begin until all processing for the pipelines is complete.  If we have any problems or issues he will contact me and I will start the escalation process.    

If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call.   Thanks.  Jean x51615
