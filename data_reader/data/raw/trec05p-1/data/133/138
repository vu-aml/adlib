Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back.

He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2762&key=1094&"><B>Emmitt Smith</B></A>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2762&key=1184&"><B>Frank Sanders</B></A>, WR ARI - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>!

However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2762&key=133263&"><B>Daunte Culpepper</B></A>, QB MIN - Giggles <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2762&key=12576&"><B>Randy Moss</B></A>, WR MIN - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y.

Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2762&key=1234&"><B>Willie Jackson</B></A>, WR NO - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2762&key=1440&"><B>Stephen Davis</B></A>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull <FONT SIZE=1>Up!
