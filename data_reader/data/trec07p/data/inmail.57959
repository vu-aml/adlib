I poked around a bit in gdb.  I don't have any answers or patches, but
hopefully a little more information will be helpful.

In Parrot_get_HLL_id, between the 31st and 32nd calls to this function,
the string memory for the "name" string, from the "name_pmc" PMC, is
freed.  The string pointer is not updated.  So, the next time around,
segfault.

(gdb) print name->strstart
$28 = 0xb5607b00 "106"
(gdb) cont
Continuing.

Note the pointer value is the same; the first time it's valid and the
string is displayed.  The second time, it's "out of bounds".


Valgrind has some very interesting things to say about this test
script, including lots of undefined data warnings, lots of accesses 
outside of allocated ranges, and also such gems as "definitely lost:
1,476,179 bytes in 13,925 blocks".  But most importantly, it tells us
what freed the memory:

I don't know *why* it was freed, but at least that tells us *where*.
And parrot -G runs great, of course.
