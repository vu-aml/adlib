I need to call the place today.  You go ahead and make plans - some Tony's
margaritas will do you some good.  I can take them to their first session if
need be. It's only 30 minutes.  Their instructor is a college student named
Frank - he has been training down there for the last four months, but this
is his first session to teach.  I guess I am a little apprehensive about
that - but then I think, I was teaching kids by myself at age 13.  Funny,
how it's different when you think about entrusting your kids with someone
else.  What are your thoughts?
