Hello my dear friend, I was divinely inspired to pick your name among other =
names found from the chambers of commerce and Industries here in  the Spain. =
After series of prayers/fasting for  Gods direction.
 
I am Musa Adams person from Dubai{United  Arab
Emirate}. undergoing  medical treatment In  France since 12-9-2004.please I =
need your help since the  incidence that led to the death of my late wife    =
Halia Fadi  Adams who  is a missionary of Movement for soverity and we are =
also  a gold marchant. since then things has notrealy been  the same again =
for me and I know we have not met before but, I am contacting  you with due =
sense of humanity, responsibility and the believed that you will  give my =
proposal a mutual understanding.  . Since her death I decided not to re-marry =
or get a child  outside my matrimonial home When my late wife  was alive we  =
deposited the sum of$1.6 (One Million six hundred thousand  U.S.Dollars) with =
one finance/security company.Recently,my Doctor told me 
that I would not last for the next three months due to advanced cancer of  =
the pancreas which spread to my liver and into my kidneys problem. Though  =
what disturbs me most is my partial paralysis. The real content was not  =
declared as it was kept as photographic Material. Having known my condition I =
 decided to donate this fund to a responsible/reliable person that's caring 
and kind hearted that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct  =
here in. I am a Christian with the fear of GOD in any thing I am doing so =
please I want us to build trust on each other the deposited documents shall  =
be sent to you as soon as you indicate your interest. If you will be of  =
assistance, I will surely appreciate and thank you for your kindness in  =
giving me this help. Waiting for your urgent response. Thank you and God  =
bless.
