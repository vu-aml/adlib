Latest NFL Player News

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Dayne has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks.
He may score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for
Fantasy owners overall. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Barber has played well recently, compiling 233 scrimmage yards and a
touchdown in his last two games. Oakland has been vulnerable to the run
this season, so look for the Giants to use Barber prominently in their
offense in Week 11. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Hilliard continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a
sore toe. He may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary,
however, especially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Toomer caught five balls for 60 yards against Minnesota on Monday night,
but he'll struggle to post similar numbers vs. Oakland. The Raiders have a
formidable secondary, so benching Toomer in smaller Fantasy leagues is a
wise move. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Collins had a solid game yardage-wise against Minnesota, throwing for 321
yards on Monday night. However, he has had trouble getting the ball into
the end zone consistently, which makes him a risky Fantasy player. As a
result, benching him in Week 11 against Oakland is advisable. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Jackson has been somewhat inconsistent as a Fantasy player, but he does
have the potential to post great numbers every week. If you play in a
deeper league, it's worth taking a gamble on Jackson against New England. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Horn is dealing with a number of nagging injuries, but he's been playing
through them quite well. In fact, Horn has 14 catches for 247 yards and two
touchdowns in his last two games, and is a must-start in Week 11 against
New England based on his potential to post huge numbers. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Bennett is proving all the critics right who said he wasn't ready for the
NFL style of game. He's been a huge Fantasy disappointment and is barely
worth a roster spot at this point. He'll do nothing against Chicago's
aggressive run defense, so don't bother starting him. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Culpepper finally had a breakout game last week, connecting on four
touchdown passes against the N.Y. Giants. He should have success against
Chicago's secondary on Sunday, so be sure to include him when you choose
your Week 11 starting lineup. 

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Carter had 10 catches for 46 yards and a touchdown on Monday night against
the Giants, proving that he is still a valuable Fantasy player. He should
have another solid outing on Sunday against Chicago, whose pass defense is
ranked last in the league. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
The Colts placed Pathon on injured reserve Tuesday with a damaged ligament
in his right foot, effectively ending his season. He will undergo surgery
in the near future, and you should cut him if you were holding onto him
awaiting his return.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Glenn did not practice Tuesday or participate in the pre-practice
walkthrough on Wednesday, according to published reports. He is unlikely to
play Sunday against New Orleans and shouldn't be on anyone's Fantasy roster
at this point.

Byron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Chamberlain locked up his right knee on Monday night against the N.Y.
Giants, but he's expected to play this weekend vs. Chicago. Chamberlain has
been unreliable of late, and getting open against Chicago's tough
linebacking group won't be an easy task. 

Ahman Green, RB GB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Green had a huge game against Detroit back in Week One, rushing for 157
yards and two touchdowns. He's a must-start in Week 11 against those same
Lions, whose defense is questionable at best. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Favre had a somewhat rough outing last weekend, throwing three
interceptions against Atlanta. However, he's still one of the best Fantasy
quarterbacks in the league, and he should bounce back on Thanksgiving
against Detroit. 

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Freeman has been solid of late, catching four touchdown passes in his last
five games. He's a must start against Detroit's vulnerable pass defense in
Week 11. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Franks has cooled off considerably in recent weeks, but his potential to
find the end zone still makes him a good Fantasy player. Unless you have a
better option, starting Franks is advisable. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Schroeder caught four passes for 55 yards and a touchdown last weekend
against Atlanta. He's been one of the more reliable Fantasy receivers in
the league, and should have a huge game vs. Detroit's weak secondary. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Batch had a huge game against Arizona last weekend, but he's been
inconsistent this season for the most part. He's better off used when the
matchup is right, so facing a tough Green Bay defense may not bode well for
his Fantasy numbers.

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Morton had a big game against Arizona last weekend, and has been a
surprisingly reliable Fantasy player this season. He may struggle against
Green Bay's tough pass defense, but he's still worth taking a gamble on in
Week 11. 

Desmond Howard, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Howard is not expected to miss an extended period of time due to his
shoulder injury. He hasn't practitced this week, however, and is listed as
doubtful for Thursday's game against Green Bay. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Emanuel, who suffered a sprained left knee during last weekend's game
against Arizona, will miss at least four weeks of action. There was a
chance that he'd be out for the season, but now he's expected to return in
mid-to-late December. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Stewart (ankle) practiced on Tuesday and feels as though he's ready to
return to action. "I feel pretty good," Stewart told the <I>Detroit Free
Press</I>. "It felt better than I thought. I'm just going to see, let (the
medical staff and coach Marty Mornhinweg) decide whether I play or not."
His carries may be down a bit in his first game back, but he's worth
starting in deeper leagues. 

Troy Hambrick, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Hambrick will return to fullback/backup duties on Thursday against Denver.
With Emmitt Smith expected to play, Hambrick isn't worth starting on your
Fantasy team in Week 11. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Galloway is a shell of his former self, catching only 24 passes through his
first seven games this season. Dallas' pathetic quarterbacks have been the
real reason for Galloway's subpar numbers, making him a huge gamble from a
Fantasy perspective. Unless you're desperate, don't consider starting
Galloway in Week 11. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Ismail has been Dallas' most consistent receiver, but starting him is still
a gamble from a Fantasy perspective. Dallas has the worst pass offense in
the league, so playing Ismail isn't advisable unless you're desperate. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Miller put up solid numbers last weekend against Tampa Bay, throwing for
228 yards and three touchdowns. Miller has been inconsistent this season,
but starting him in Week 11 against a shaky Minnesota secondary is
definitely worth considering.

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Thomas' yardage numbers have slipped in the last two weeks, but he's still
worth starting in Week 11 vs. Minnesota. The Vikings are giving up 124.3
yards rushing per game, so look for the Bears to run Thomas early and
often. 

Dez White, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
White is dealing with a slight ankle injury, but he's expected to play
against Minnesota. The Vikings secondary has been vulnerable to the pass
this season, so starting White in a deeper league is worth considering. 

Isaac Byrd, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Byrd will likely start in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad in Week 11
against Atlanta. The Falcons pass defense is one of the worst units in the
league, so Byrd could actually put up some decent Fantasy numbers. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Walls put up only two catches for 30 yards last weekend, but he did find
the end zone for the fifth time this season. Unless you've got a better
option, starting Walls on a weekly basis is advisable. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Smith had a mediocre game last weekend vs. Green Bay, but he's likely to
bounce back against Carolina. The Panthers have the worst run defense in
the league, so Smith should have no problem putting up solid Fantasy
numbers in Week 11. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at all this season, but he
could have a decent outing against Carolina. The Panthers secondary is one
of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in deeper Fantasy leagues
may be worth considering. 

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but he's expected to play on
Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary hasn't been playing well
of late, so giving Sanders some consideration in deeper leagues is
advisable. 

David Boston, WR ARI - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Boston has become one of the premier wide receivers in Fantasy Football.
He's posted three touchdowns and 217 yards receiving in his last two games,
and should have another solid game vs. San Diego in Week 11. 

Tom Brady, QB NE - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick announced late Monday that Brady will
remain the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season, barring
injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe to a backup role and makes him useless
from a Fantasy perspective. Brady might have his hands full passing against
the Saints on Sunday, but he is a fairly safe weekly starter otherwise.

 Dolphins, DT MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Defensive tackle Daryl Gardener could miss the remainder of the season due
to a fragmented disc in his back. He will miss at least one month to rest
and rehabilitate the injury before being re-evaluated. Gardener's absence
hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, which might be burned a little more by
opposing running backs in the upcoming weeks.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Minnis is unlikely to be available for Sunday's game against Seattle due to
the sprained ankle he suffered during a Nov. 11 game against the Jets. He
will be replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup at split end, and you should
keep him reserved for this week.

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Brunell's nagging leg injury might sideline him for Sunday's game against
Baltimore. He decided about two hours before last Sunday's kickoff that he
couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to a strained right quadriceps.
Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he will start the game, so right
now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as you set your lineups.

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Taylor received a second medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe
groin injury could keep him out up to three months and possibly the
remainder of the season, according to the <I>Florida Times-Union</I>. The
diagnosis was that the injury still has not healed and will need more time
to become healthy, and in the meantime Taylor has developed pain in his
hip, a side effect of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor
will not play again this Fantasy season, although you should probably hold
onto him until a final decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough
bench.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enough for him to practice on
Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss Thursday's game against
Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravated it during Sunday's
game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith on your bench for
this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Broncos' offense as well
- the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it would be prior to the
season.

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/20/01
With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Alexander
will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during their
charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against the
Chiefs this week.

Tom Brady, QB NE - Uran Man Updated 11/20/01
The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain
the team's No. 2 QB. "I don't see any changes this week," coach Bill
Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe
to your roster as an insurance policy if you can.

Jonathan Quinn, QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this
week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game.

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/20/01
Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice,
says the <i>Seattle Times</i>. He is not expected to return for another two
to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer
for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 11/20/01
Mike Riley told the <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i> there is no QB
controversy involving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. "Doug is going to be
our quarterback," he said. "You can talk about controversy all you want,
but there is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will
start. He will get us the next win the next week." Still, Flutie is not
playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.

Mark Bruener, TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury.
His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is
widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/20/01
Wheatley told the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i> he is no longer being bothered
by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.

Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected
to return to practice early this week.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/20/01
Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky
start in Week 11.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/20/01
The <i>Tennessean</i> says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the
team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect
him to miss any practice time this week. 

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/20/01
Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against
Seattle.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may
have to start in his place,

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game
against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/20/01
Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve.
Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to
be moved back into the starting lineup. 

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/20/01
Dave Wannstedt told the <i>Miami Herald</i> there is no QB controversy
surrounding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of
hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're
going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 11/20/01
Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently
healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. "We'll get a chance
to evaluate that during the week and see," Shanahan told the <i>Denver
Post</i>. "If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a
situation where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our
team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in." 

Benjamin Gay, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
The <i>Cleveland Plain-Dealer</i> says Butch Davis won't indicate how much
Gay will play in the near future. "We'll try to get him involved in some of
the games," Davis said. "We'll see." 

Kevin Lockett, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to
play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real
value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia.
Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been
feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for the
'Skins. 

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/20/01
Green (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on Wednesday at full
strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the
matchup is favorable. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 11/20/01
Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session
of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered
serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on
Sunday Indianapolis. 

Cecil Martin, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday's game against Dallas.
He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expected to play in this
weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy
player, but he is a key blocker for Duce Staley. 

 Giants, DT NYG - Team Dick Updated 11/20/01
According to the <I>New York Post</I>, cornerback Jason Sehorn's
surgically-repaired right knee began giving him problems again this past
weekend. In fact, the team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either
Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he
continues to play on a bad wheel, you should consider starting any
receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/20/01
The <i>Baltimore Sun</i> says there is no indication that Grbac will be
replaced as the team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough
to start for most Fantasy teams.

Donald Driver, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss
Thursday's game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a
Fantasy player at this point. 

 Ravens, DT BAL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/20/01
Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after
undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of
the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage
than usual. 

 Cowboys, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Linebacker Dexter Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a
sprained knee, will likely get the start on Thursday after being out for
just one game. He'll help keep Denver's running game in check, but don't
expect his presence to give Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/20/01
Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Denver. "I'm not 100
percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job," Smith told the <I>Dallas
Morning Star</I>. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to
Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 11/20/01
Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He
may miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this
weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the
league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11. 

Terry Hardy, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Hardy is expected to return to practice this week after missing three games
due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to play on Sunday
against San Diego. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Harris is out for Thursday's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury.
Harris has been an unreliable Fantasy player and is only worth a roster
spot in deeper leagues. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/20/01
Stewart (ankle) is hopeful that he can play returned to practice and may
start Thursday's game against Green Bay. He will work his ankle extensively
in practice prior to Thursday, and is optimistic that he'll be ready to
play. If Stewart is able to go, he's worth starting in if you need a
running back for Week 11. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 11/20/01
Taylor has been told by a medical specialist that he should not return to
action this weekend against Pittsburgh. In fact, Taylor could be out for an
even longer period of time than what was originally diagnosed. Taylor tore
the groin muscle completely off the bone back in Week Two, which is an
injury that normally takes about three months to heal. "It's going to be
very unfair for anyone to assume he will play any time in the immediate
future," said Taylor's agent, Drew Rosenhaus. "He's just not healthy yet.
He can't run full speed without tremendous pain. The Jaguars have done a
very good job in working him but he's still in pain." Expect Stacey Mack
and Elvis Joseph to continue splitting carries in Taylor's absence. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 11/20/01
Emanuel is out for Thursday's game against Green Bay due to a sprained
ankle. In fact, the injury is so bad that Emanuel may miss the remiander of
the season, but no definitive word on his condition has been made by the
team.

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/20/01
According to published reports, Muhammad's shoulder injury will likely keep
him out of Sunday's game against Atlanta. That could mean big things for
Donald Hayes and Issac Bryd, who'll start against a questionable Falcons
secondary. 

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Luccis Losers Updated 11/20/01
Cleeland (ankle) is doubtful for Sunday's game at New England. He'll likely
be replaced again by Boo Williams, who scored two touchdowns last week
against Indianapolis. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
According to the <I>Dallas Morning News</I>, Carter expects to start on
Dec. 2 against Washington. Carter, who has been out since October with a
hamstring injury, will serve as the No. 3 quarterback on Thursday vs.
Denver. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 11/19/01
Hilliard continues to feel some soreness in his surgically-repaired toe,
and it is causing him to limp around a bit. He is still expected to start
in Monday's game against Minnesota, but playing on the artificial turf
can't be good for his injury. 

Reggie Kelly, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
According to published reports, Kelly (knee/ankle) should be able to return
to action this weekend against Carolina. He won't make much of a Fantasy
impact, however, so don't bother starting him in Week 11. 

Chad Lewis, TE PHI - Blue Balls Updated 11/19/01
Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's 36-3 win over Dallas.
The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Lewis is expected to
start this weekend's game against Washington. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/19/01
McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the
<i>Tennessean</i> says he will probably miss some practice time this week.
He should still be able to play in the team's next game.

 Packers, DT GB - Uran Man Updated 11/19/01
Safety LeRoy Butler suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during
Sunday's game against Atlanta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the
remainder of the season. Chris Akins will likely take over the starting
duties in Butler's absence. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/19/01
McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the
<i>Tennessean</i> says he will probably miss some practice time this week.
He should still be able to play in the team's next game.

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/19/01
Hakim left Sunday's game against New England with an ankle injury. X-rays
were negative, and Hakim is listed as day to day. 

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 11/19/01
Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's
game against Dallas is unclear.

Terance Mathis, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 11/19/01
Mathis had by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70
yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but
he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina. If you
play in a deeper league, you may want to consider starting Mathis against
the Panthers' weak pass defense. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Harris suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against
Philadelphia. He did not return to the contest, and is listed as day to
day. 

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/19/01
Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching seven passes
for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the game,
however, and is listed as day to day. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough that he's ready to
return to action. However, the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more
weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. The team wants to evaluate
Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll have any trade value
in the offseason. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/19/01
Jackson told the <i>Cleveland Plain-Dealer</i> it was a coach's decision
not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering from an ankle
injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have been able
to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fantasy value
might drop greatly.

Ryan Leaf, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the <I>Dallas Morning
News</I> is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for
the time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fantasy
Football. 

Kevin Lockett, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib
injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain
at this time. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told
the <I>Washington Post</I> that there's a "definite possibility" he would
be ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham
would start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive
Fantasy option against the Eagles. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/19/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee.
However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when Dallas faces
Denver on Thanksgiving Day. 

Larry Foster, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against
Arizona. He is listed as day to day.

Desmond Howard, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did
not return to the game, and is listed as day to day. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 11/19/01

listed as day to day. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His
status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.
