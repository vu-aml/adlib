mistake," Obama told AP.

"Obama telephoned several Indian American activists to express his regret for the memo." (Los Angeles Times)

"It's the latest in a string of incidents in which the Illinois Democrat has distanced himself from actions taken by
his staff, while his opponents say Mr. Obama's campaign is obviously employing tactics that top campaign officials and
the candidate himself have said they wouldn't use." (Washington Times)

* Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) told Boston Globe editors and reporters that he "has been stunned by the personal attacks on
him from conservatives angry" about the immigration bill, and acknowledged "his outspoken support for overhauling
immigration laws is complicating his presidential campaign." (Boston Globe)

* GA Secretary of State Karen Handel predicts a special election today in Georgia's 10th congressional district "will
draw an abysmal 10 percent turnout." 10 candidates are running to replace the late Rep. Charlie Norwood (R-GA).

U.S. ENDS 15-MONTH-OLD PALESTINIAN EMBARGO: The Bush administration yesterday lifted economic sanctions and a
diplomatic embargo against the Palestinian Authority after its expulsion of the Islamist group Hamas, which seized the
Gaza Strip last week. Seeking to strengthen President Mahmoud Abbas by resuming direct U.S. aid, the administration
moved swiftly after Mr. Abbas ousted Hamas from his national security council, installed an emergency Cabinet and
outlawed the terrorist militia, which calls for the destruction of Israel and the death of all Jews worldwide.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said yesterday that she told new Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad of the
decision to end the 15-month-old embargo in a telephone call. Washington Times: U.S. lifts Palestinian embargo

CROCKER ASKS RICE FOR STATE'S "BEST PEOPLE": Ryan C. Crocker, the new U.S. ambassador to Iraq, bluntly told Secretary
of State Condoleezza Rice in a cable dated May 31 that the embassy in Baghdad -- the largest and most expensive U.S.
embassy -- lacks enough well-qualified staff members and that its security rules are too restrictive for Foreign
Service officers to do their jobs. "Simply put, we cannot do the nation's most important work if we do not have the
Department's best people," Crocker said in the memo. The unclassified cable underscores the State Department's struggle
to find its role in the turmoil in Iraq. With a 2007 budget of more than $1 billion and a staff that has expanded to
more than 1,000 Americans and 4,000 third-country nationals, the embassy has become the center of a bureaucratic battle
between Crocker, who wants to strengthen the staff, and some members of Congress, who are increasingly skeptical about
the diplomatic mission's rising costs. Washington Post: Embassy Staff In Baghdad Inadequate, Rice Is Told
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/18/AR2007061801503.html

OFFICIALS "DISOBEYED AT LEAST SIX NEW LAWS" AFTER SIGNING STATEMENTS: Federal officials have disobeyed at least six new
laws that President Bush challenged in his signing statements, a government study disclosed yesterday. The report
provides the first evidence that the government may have acted on claims by Bush that he can set aside laws under his
executive powers. In a report to Congress, the non partisan Government Accountability Office studied a small sample of
the bill provisions that Bush has signed into law but also challenged with signing statements. The GAO found that
agencies disobeyed six such laws, while enforcing 10 others as written even though Bush had challenged them. Boston
Globe: US agencies disobey 6 laws that president challenged

ROVE USED RNC EMAIL ACCOUNT "MOST OF THE TIME": White House aides made extensive use of political e-mail accounts for
official government business, despite rules requiring that they conduct such business through official communications
channels, according to new evidence disclosed yesterday by congressional investigators. The Republican National
Committee told the investigators that White House senior political adviser Karl Rove alone sent or received more than
140,000 e-mails between 2002 and 2007, more than half of which involved individuals using official ".gov" e-mail
accounts, a report from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said. The RNC said it still has copies of
those e-mails. Washington Post: Bush Aides' Misuse of E-Mail Detailed by House Committee
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/18/AR2007061800809.html

WAXMAN WANTS TO INVESTIGATE AG ON EMAIL: House Democrats are preparing a new line of investigation into Attorney
General Alberto Gonzales, suggesting that as White House counsel, Gonzales allowed staff members to continue using
Republican National Committee e-mail accounts to conduct official government business, in violation of the Presidential
Records Act.  The new allegation against Gonzales is part of a report released Monday by Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.),
chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, summarizing the investigation to date into RNC e-mail
accounts maintained by White House officials. Republicans argue that Democrats have no evidence to support such a
charge, and that the investigation is becoming a waste of time. Roll Call: Waxman Hits AG on E-mails

HOUSE DEMS CONSIDER BREAKING UP IMMIGRATION BILL: House Democrats say they may break the immigration issue up into a
series of smaller bills that would put off the tougher parts and allow others to pass, such as border security, and
high-tech and agriculture worker programs that have clear support. That could buy Democrats more time to work out the
tougher aspects of immigration, such as what to do about the estimated 12 million to 20 million illegal aliens now
here, but it would go against the Senate's massive catchall approach and contradicts President Bush's call for a broad
bill to pass. "There is active, serious discussion in that regard," said Rep. Alcee L. Hastings, Florida Democrat, who
said Democratic leaders tossed the idea around at a recent meeting. "The idea is out there, and there is listening
going on by the leadership in regards to immigration on trying to come up with something that is doable, sensible and
plausible to the American people." Washington Times: Democrats mull dividing House immigration bill
http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20070619-121822-3573r.htm

DEMS GET "FIRST CHANCE AT A PUBLIC AIRING" OF CIA PRACTICES: In the months after the Sept. 11 attacks, at a time when
the Central Intelligence Agency had long been out of the interrogation business, senior C.I.A. officers scrambled to
build a program to question terror suspects in secret jails abroad. To check on the legality of the harsh interrogation
techniques they proposed, they turned to John A. Rizzo, who was then acting as the agency's top lawyer. On Tuesday, Mr.
Rizzo will go before the Senate Intelligence Committee for a confirmation hearing to become the C.I.A.'s general
counsel, giving the new Democratic majority its first chance at a public airing of agency practices that drew
condemnation abroad and set off a prolonged debate at home. New York Times: Question Time for Nominee Linked to
Interrogations http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/washington/19rizzo.html

REID SUGGESTS JULY 4 RECESS MIGHT BE CANCELED: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's (D-Nev.) efforts to complete work on
the immigration bill might again disrupt the weekend travel schedules of those senators running for president. Reid's
warning on the Senate floor yesterday that "if they're going to be gone from the Senate, they're likely going to miss
votes," prompted an aide to one of the presidential campaigns to respond simply, "Yuck." Reid also suggested the Fourth
of July recess might be canceled if the Senate can't complete meaningful work on energy and immigration legislation.

CONGRESSIONAL BASEBALL GAME ALMOST A VICTIM OF NEW ETHICS RULES: If it were only a question of the weather or Rep.
Heath Shuler's wobbly foot, then putting on the annual congressional baseball game would be like catching a pop fly at
third base. But the 46-year-old charity game pitting Republicans against Democrats has been unexpectedly ensnared in
new congressional ethics rules. Organizers now say they will be lucky to match the $120,000 they raised last year since
the rules complicate the process of soliciting donations and have led to at least one corporate sponsor pulling out
altogether. "It's been really difficult to raise money," said Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), manager of the Republican
team. "These new rules are so technical that something that's been going on for decades almost didn't happen." The

"ABYSMAL" 10 PERCENT TURNOUT EXPECTED IN GA-10: There's been little suspense about who will top the 10-candidate field
in Tuesday's voting to replace the late U.S. Rep. Charlie Norwood, which Secretary of State Karen Handel predicts will
draw an abysmal 10 percent turnout for the special election. But for a few hours after the polls close, the 10th
Congressional District, extending from Clayton to Augusta and Athens, will be the focus of keen attention far beyond
its borders. As the first congressional election since the Democrats won back control of Congress in 2006, the
nonpartisan voting will be scrutinized as a possible bellwether for how national issues, which have dominated most of
the campaign discussion, may play in elections next year — including the presidential race. In particular, it will be
studied for what it portends about the political impact of the two big "I's": immigration and Iraq. Atlanta

DEBATE OVER VOTING RIGHTS FOR MENTALLY ILL: Rhode Island is among a growing number of states grappling with the
question of who is too mentally impaired to vote. The issue is drawing attention for two major reasons: increasing
efforts by the mentally ill and their advocates to secure voting rights, and mounting concern by psychiatrists and
others who work with the elderly about the rights and risks of voting by people with conditions like Alzheimer's
disease and dementia. This summer, recommendations for national standards will be released by a group of psychiatrists,
lawyers and others led by the American Bar Association, suggesting that people be prevented from voting only if they
cannot indicate, with or without help, "a specific desire to participate in the voting process." New York Times: States
Face Decisions on Who Is Mentally Fit to Vote http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/us/19vote.html

"GREEN LIGHT" TO HIT BUSH: A president with dismal approval ratings and a bitter intraparty rupture over immigration
are obvious problems for Republican politicians. In recent days, however, the combination is emerging as something less
obvious: an opportunity. Recent polls have shown Bush's popularity -- which has long been in the tank with independents
-- suffering significant erosion even among GOP base voters, largely due to a backlash over the president's stance on
immigration. The decline, according to some Republican strategists, has flashed a green light for lawmakers on Capitol
Hill and presidential candidates to put distance between themselves and an unpopular president -- a politically
essential maneuver for the 2008 general election that remained risky as long as Bush retained the sympathies of
Republican stalwarts. The Politico: Republican candidates begin snubbing Bush
http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0607/4538.html

CAMPAIGNS RAISE SPENDING ON WEB ADS: In the entire 2004 campaign, the parties and presidential candidates combined
spent roughly $17,000 for ads on political blogs. During one week last month, one presidential candidate alone --
Democrat John Edwards -- spent nearly the same amount on more than 25 liberal blogs asking people to sign an online
petition in opposition to the Iraq war. Such spending isn't an anomaly. An unusually early start to what has become an
unusually competitive presidential race has prompted campaign veterans to look to the Internet for new, relatively
inexpensive ways to reach potential supporters, and to raise funds. While the amount of money the campaigns are
collectively expected to spend online this year won't likely amount to more than a rounding error compared to the
hundreds of millions expected to be spent on broadcast ads, it marks the beginning of a broader shift away from
candidates' reliance on traditional media. Wall Street Journal: Long Race Forces Ad Ingenuity

HOW TO DEAL WITH GITMO IS CRITICAL ISSUE ON THE TRAIL: Promising to close the prison holding terrorism suspects at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is a big applause line for Democratic presidential candidates. Just how to do it is a thorny
thicket they haven't thoroughly explored. For Republicans, who view fighting terrorism as a top issue in their
presidential nomination fight, the divide is over whether to close the prison and how to extract information from
detainees. Among the 10 announced Republican candidates, only Arizona Sen. John McCain and Texas Rep. Ron Paul favor
closing the prison. Guantanamo, a symbol of U.S. efforts to fight terrorism, is a critical part of what both political
parties see as a defining issue facing the next president: how to repair international relations while battling
terrorist plots. USA Today: How to handle Guantanamo Bay puzzles candidates
http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20070619/a_gitmo19.art.htm

OBAMA BLAMES RESEARCH STAFF FOR "SCREW-UP": Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama described as "sarcastic" and
"cheap" the tone of a memo his campaign put out last week implying that Hillary Clinton's personal investments in India
made her fit to represent the South Asian country. But Obama said in a meeting Monday that his campaign would conduct
opposition research, even if it's intended to criticize his rivals, despite his pledge to avoid "backbiting and
tactical" politics. "I think there's a big difference between us putting out a memo that says our competition says one
thing but seems to be doing something else... and, to me, the tone of this memo that came out of our shop... it was
sarcastic. To me, it was cheap," he said... Obama called the memo "a screw-up on the part of our research staff" and
said it was released on a not-for-attribution basis. Des Moines Register: 'Cheap' jab blurs Obama's clean run

BILL TO JOIN HIL ON TRAIL IN IA: Former President Clinton will campaign with his wife, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, in
Iowa next month, seeking to boost her bid for the Democratic nomination in a state where she trails in the polls. The
former president will spend three days in Iowa with Sen. Clinton from July 2-4. "The schedule is still being worked
out, but it is the first time he's joined the campaign," said spokesman Mark Daley. The Clintons have appeared together
at campaign fundraisers. Bill Clinton's decision to join the campaign comes at a time when Sen. Clinton is struggling
in Iowa, which opens the nomination process with caucuses in January. Although she leads national polls of Democrats
seeking the nomination, recent Iowa polls show her trailing John Edwards in the state. Illinois Sen. Barack Obama also
is polling strongly in Iowa. AP via Yahoo! News: Former president to campaign with wife

ROMNEY ACCEPTS BROWNBACK APOLOGY OVER STAFFER'S EMAIL: Republican presidential hopeful Sam Brownback on Monday
telephoned rival Mitt Romney to apologize for a campaign staffer's e-mail criticizing the Mormon church. The Kansas
senator "was very disappointed, clearly sort of personally hurt that this had happened in his team, and he said he is
going to be very aggressive to make sure it doesn't happen again," spokesman Brian Hart said. "There's no place for
this in his campaign." Romney said Monday night that he had accepted Brownback's apology. "He said that religious
attacks don't have any place in politics and, of course, we agree on that," Romney said. "I told him that was not a big
matter to me. If I can't stand the heat I shouldn't be in the kitchen." AP via Yahoo! News: Brownback apologizes to
Romney http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070619/ap_on_el_pr/on_the2008_trail

McCAIN TELLS GLOBE EDITORS HE'S "GUARDEDLY OPTIMISTIC" ON IMMIGRATION BILL: Senator John McCain of Arizona said
yesterday that he was "guardedly optimistic" that the Senate's controversial immigration legislation will pass
Congress, and added that he has been stunned by the personal attacks on him from conservatives angry about the bill.
"I'm still hopeful we can get it done," McCain said in a wide-ranging interview with reporters and editors at the
Globe. McCain, who acknowledges that his outspoken support for overhauling immigration laws is complicating his
presidential campaign, relayed a story about attending a recent fund-raiser where protesters were standing outside
holding signs that declared: "McCain -- traitor." Boston Globe: McCain voices optimism on immigration plan
