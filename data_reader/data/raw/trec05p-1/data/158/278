	In addition to other requests from UBS concerning credit, these were added.  I forwarded these to Bill Bradford as well, but they are a bit more strategic so I'm sending them to you as well.  We are targeting tomorrow afternoon / evening to have a discussion with the UBS credit team.

Please pass on to bill bradford -- these are the follow-up questions.  Hope your singing voice comes back.


Explain the five worst losses

Provide examples of the five or ten trading strategies that we will anticipate using, particularly in the early stages

They'd like to meet with david port mid-morning to talk about models / risk parameters
