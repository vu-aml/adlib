We have been notified by Bloomberg that you are listed as a user of a Bloomberg system that has not been logged into for several
months.  Due to the high monthly cost of maintaining a Bloomberg (approx. $1400 per month), this system will be cancelled/relocated if we do not hear from you.

Please let us know if you would like to have continued access to this system.  



Thank you for your assistance, and feel free to contact me with any questions.
