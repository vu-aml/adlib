Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Newsletter - News You Can Use

Millions of people have COPD, or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. 
In fact, COPD is the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States. 

COPD is a lung condition that makes it more and more difficult to breathe. 
Both chronic bronchitis and emphysema are considered part of COPD.

COPD can affect your life as early as your early 40s. Both men and women can get it. 
Tobacco smoke causes approximately 80% to 90% of all cases of COPD. 
In fact, a smoker is 10 times more likely to die of COPD than a nonsmoker.

Another cause of COPD is exposure to indoor or outdoor pollutants. 
If your job exposes you to toxic chemicals and pollutants, you will 
also have increased odds of developing COPD. 

A recent study found that an estimated 19.2% of COPD was attributed in part to work-related exposure.

Experts believe that about 10 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD. 
However, just as many people have some form of lung impairment but have not been diagnosed with COPD.

COPD may go unnoticed in its early stages. This is because 
it is often confused with asthma, a bad cough, or a natural part of aging. 

Also, many people think of COPD as a disease that only affects the elderly. 
In fact, more than 70% of patients who have COPD are under age 65. 
And some people start having symptoms in their early 40s.

THE SYMPTOMS OF COPD

The symptoms of COPD tend to develop gradually and can begin in a person's early 40s. 
They may be worse some days than others, or they may be bad all the time. 
The important thing is to identify the symptoms early and get treatment.

Common symptoms of COPD include: 

* Shortness of breath (dyspnea)óIn the early stages of COPD, patients may experience 
breathlessness only during strenuous activity. This might include climbing stairs or exercising. 
At first, they may see this as a sign of aging or being out of shape. But gradually, 
patients begin to feel shortness of breath even during simple activities. 
This can happen when simply walking across the room, or even at rest 

* Chronic coughóIt is often the first symptom of COPD to develop. 
Many people discount it as ìsmoker's coughî or the effect of cold weather at first 

* Increase and/or change in sputumóPatients often produce sputum (also called phlegm) after coughing 

* WheezingóWheezing is a whistling or squeaking noise that is heard when the patient breathes. 
It may be caused by the narrowing of the airways in the lungs 

* Chest tightnessóPatients describe this as a feeling of pressure on the chest, 
as if being wrapped tightly by a blanket
