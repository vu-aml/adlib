 	 Message from Yahoo! about changes to our Privacy Policy and your Marketing Preferences 	

Your privacy is very important to us here at Yahoo!. We are sending you this email to let you know that we have updated our Privacy Policy. You can read our updated Privacy Policy by visiting Yahoo!'s comprehensive Privacy Center <http://privacy.yahoo.com/>.

Our commitment to privacy hasn't changed. We believe that you should understand what we do with your information and what choices you have. So why are we revising our Privacy Policy? To streamline it and make changes to address several important topics.

In recent years, we have added a Children's Privacy Policy and Privacy Information for users of Yahoo!'s financial products and services, in accordance with requirements of federal legislation. We at Yahoo! have become increasingly aware of questions about how data is treated when a user's safety may be at risk, when fraud or illegal activities may be occurring, or when companies are combined. We feel that the time is right to streamline our privacy policies into a single, comprehensive policy and to address these and other issues in the process. Please take a moment to visit our Privacy Center <http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/> and read our updated Privacy Policy. (Note: The Yahooligans! Privacy Policy, for our children's web site, has not changed. Although the format and some parts of the Yahoo! Privacy Policy have been updated, our collection, use, and treatment of information from kids under age 13 remains unchanged.)

In order to keep you up to date about our many new products and services and how they might be of use to you, we have created a new Marketing Preferences <http://subscribe.yahoo.com/showaccount> page within the Account Information area. It is designed to make it easier for you to manage the marketing communications you receive from Yahoo! and ensure you get the latest relevant information to meet your needs. We have reset your marketing preferences and, unless you decide to change these preferences, you may begin receiving marketing messages from Yahoo! about ways to enhance your Yahoo! experience, including special offers and new features. Your new marketing preferences will not take effect until 60 days after the date of this mailing so you have plenty of time to decide what you want to receive and what you don't. To change your preferences, go to the Marketing Preferences <http://subscribe.yahoo.com/showaccount> page.

Yahoo! recognizes that while we've grown and changed, things in your life have probably also changed. You may have a new job, a different email address, a new house or different interests. We invite you to take this opportunity to update your personal information <http://edit.yahoo.com/config/eval_profile?.src=&.done=http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy /us/> so you can continue to receive content and advertising that is most relevant and interesting to you. Please do not reply to this message. If you have any questions about these changes, please visit our Frequently Asked Questions <http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/privacy/> page.

Thank you,

The Yahoo! Team
