Mark and Margaret, 
 Here is email from Amarjit stating that he has gone to India.  His start date was set for this Wednesday, 10/24/01.  He will not be starting that date according to this email and will be out of the country for more than a month. At this point we do not want to pursue offering employment to Amarjit. Please let me know how to proceed or in this case stop all action going forward.

Hi Malcolm,

      Please accept my sincere apology for not being able to join Enron
right now as I had an unavoidable emergency at home that has forced me to
come to India over the weekend.My stay here might stretch to approximately a
month or so.I donot want that the company shall suffer any loss due to my
absense so pls advice accordingly.  Your company offers an invaluable
opportunity, and I would appreciate any consideration you can give me in
rescheduling my joining date after a month.
Pls contact my fiancee Kamal for any urgent issue as I am keeping my
cellphone with her.She would convey the message to me by best means.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
