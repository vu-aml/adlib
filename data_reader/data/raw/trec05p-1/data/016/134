Green Roomers,

Declan has informed me of the following info...

"Brad said that Biddys have a practice game every Sunday at 1pm at the high
school
just off 30th and Powell (Cleveland High I think).  They would like us to
practice with them each week."

Let's plan on fielding a team each Sunday at 1:00 to play the old Biddy's
team.   Should be a good way to stay in shape and organized as a team. Hope
to see you there on Sunday and if any other news comes up I will drop you a
line. 

Jon

Green Roomies,

We are registered for fall outdoor soccer in the 1st division. In first
division we'll have our work cut out for us but I think we'll do fine and
have fun.  The first game is Sept. 9th at 12:00 with 9 more games each week
thereafter.   I do not know the locations yet but will get that out as soon
as I do.  Many have suggested the need to practice to be competitive in the
1st division so we need to set a practice schedule.  How do Tuesday and
Thursday nights look for you guys?  We also need a field we can count
on....Ideas anyone?  In the meantime we all need to be keeping our fitness
in mind...running twice a week 4-6 miles would be a good start.  If we can
hit the fall season in good shape and well organized I am sure we'll be a
very competitive 1st division team.  I have been paid by Mike Z., Kevin,
Adam, Scott, Jon B., Mike B., Jay, Justin, Declan, Tristan, and Jacob.  The
rest of you still need to mail $50 to Jon Gail 8573 SW Dakota Drive,
Tualatin OR 97062 if you want to play.  Again please send me your
suggestions regarding practice fields and let me know if you have any
questions.  Later,

Jon Gail, Manager
