Take a look at this.  A good friend of mine runs the pro bono C-Bar service.  She was recently named by the Texas Lawyer as one of the 40 best lawyers in the state under the age of 40.  More details below.  Read the e-mail.  Know anyone at Enron who would be interested?

Hi Andy. Thank you for the very nice message. All is very well in

Austin. How's Houston and the horse? Hope we can get down to Houston

soon. Have you gotten to meet Ella yet?

By the way, I finally got to make a C-BAR presentation to Bracewell in

Houston, which Marcy organizated, and the firm is now actively involved.

I really like Marcy--she is very cool.  Your message reminded me of

ENRON and how I have sent a couple of unanswered messages to Jim Derrick

at the recommendation of Scott Atlas to see if we can get get Enron

attorneys involved and/or to get an Enron attorney to serve on our

Houston advisory board. I believe Scott said he had talked to Jim about

2 years ago about getting Enron to partner with V&E attorneys on

transactional pro bono matters. Scott said Jim sounded interested and

suggested I contact him as well. What is the current status of pro bono

there? We work very closely with V&E and are still very interested in

the partnership model.   Attached is additional info for corporate

counsel and the role they can play in C-BAR.

On the advisory board front, we are currently looking for transactional

attorneys to serve on a new Houston advisory board for C-BAR as well as

a newly restructured statewide operating board.  Would love to have an

Enron attorney serve on one of the boards.  The quick and easy low down

is that the advisory board is a very minimal commitment with 1-2

meetings a year in Houston, and the operating board will serve as a more

traditional operating board, with 4 meetings a year.  More info is

below.

Any recommendations of Enron attorneys??  Here's more background on

C-BAR and the boards:

Texas Community Building with Attorney Resources ("Texas C-BAR") is a

statewide pro bono initiative for corporate counsel and other business

law/transactional attorneys. The mission of our organization is

two-fold: (1) Empower low income people and strengthen low income

neighborhoods in Texas by providing pro bono legal services to

community-based nonprofits in Texas that serve low income individuals

and communities, with an emphasis on affordable housing development

activities; and (2) Provide attorneys who have specialized transactional

skills with increased opportunities to apply these skills to benefit low

income communities.

Since Texas C-BAR was founded in 2000, Legal Aid of Central Texas has

been our sponsoring organization, but Texas C-BAR is a statewide project

and operates with an independent advisory board.  Now that Texas C-BAR

has gotten off the ground, we are working on building 3 regional

advisory boards as well as a new statewide operating board to help us

build on our first-year successes and explore ways to expand our pro

bono opportunities for transactional lawyers.  Serving on the board of

C-BAR offers attorneys the opportunity to be part of an exciting,

innovative project.  As the only statewide business law project in

Texas, attorneys who serve on our boards will be able to play an

influential role in the future of business law pro bono and have a

long-term, positive impact on low income neighborhoods throughout the

state. Information about the duties of these boards follows:

I just heard that the Texas Lawyer listed you as one of the top 40

lawyers in the state under the age of 40.  Although I have not seen or

read the article,  that is a terrific accomplishment.  Congratulations.

The work you do provides an incredible service to the community and you

deserve all the accolades.

Hope all is well in Austin.  Please give my best to Bill.

Andy
