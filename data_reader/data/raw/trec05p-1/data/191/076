TGP's Dracut Expansion Receives FERC Approval

  

Tennessee Gas Pipeline has accepted the FERC's certificate 

authorizing construction of the Dracut Expansion project. The $35 

million project will replace 12 miles of existing 16-inch natural gas 

pipeline with a 24-inch pipeline from Dracut to Burlington, 

Massachusetts, primarily using existing rights-of-way.  The project 

will increase takeaway capacity from the Dracut interconnect by an 

additional 200,000 MMBtu per day.  Once the project is in service, 

the total capacity from Dracut will increase to more than 600,000 

MMBtu per day.  The project is scheduled to be available for service 

next fall. Tennessee initiated the growth by completing the Eastern 

Express 2000 project in January, 2000 and placed the Londonderry 

pipeline in service in September, 2001.
