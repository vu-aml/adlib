I will work on it. I need to see what happens at the FERC pre-hearing conference today to see when I have to testify  later this month. I'll get back to you. Also, if you think I am over-stepping here just let me know. I think you are really wonderful and the last thing I want to do is ruin that. Thanks.

This week is not good for me.  The week of August 13, I can do half days Tuesday - Thursday and a full day on Friday.  The week of August 20, I can do something Thursday or Friday.  Let me know if I need to go further out.  I think you should try to come up with something fun and exciting.  I will try to think of a few things myself.  

Thanks

Tracy

I figured we should check our schedules for our next "lunch" since the next week will be kind of busy with some travel I have to do. Just let me know when you have time and how much (half day? all day? Any preferences or are you going to make me have to work hard and come up with something really creative , fun and exciting?). Catch you later.
