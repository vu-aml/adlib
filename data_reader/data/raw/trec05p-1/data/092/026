FYI,

Here's the latest information on these two turbines.

Bushton Turbine - Maximum Turbine should be on site Wednesday 10/24/01 to set unit 25 at Bushton. Unit 25 is the unit they got from Mullinville. They need to get it in place, put the insulation on, and reinstall the controls. 11/01/01 is still the best date they could give me. 

Mullinville #26 - The run testing they did last week went well. They got some good data. There are still a couple of problems they are looking into. One of them is the unit won't run up to speed. The Maximum Turbine guys are schedule to head there as soon as the leave Bushton on 11/01/01.
