The fuses for the explosives authorities say were in the shoes worn by
Richard Reid on a trans-Atlantic flight may have been too moist to light,
preventing the man from carrying out a suspected plot to blow up the
plane.  Reid is due in federal court in Boston today for a detention
hearing, where federal prosecutors are expected to ask that he be held
without bail.
