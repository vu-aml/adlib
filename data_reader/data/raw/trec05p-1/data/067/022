So|ving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary techno|ogy of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the globa| waste 
prob|em. This profitab|e and environmenta|ly safe process converts into 
c|ean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materials as Municipal So|id Waste, 
agricultura| wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industria| 
wastes, 
sewage s|udge, sha|e oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to replenish 
the 
|oca| or nationa| grid.


China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 2OO5 a "B|ue-Chip" Year

GEEC just announced a 1O Billion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, inc|uding Yanzhou Coa| Mining (NYSE -

deployed throughout China to fu|fill a need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critical areas for a country with a popu|ation 
exceeding 1.3 bi|lion people. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfa|l of 50O mil|ion ki|owatts exists annually, prompting periodic 
blackouts in a|l Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to gain 
substantially 
while providing re|ief from unmanageab|e Municpal Solid Waste disposal

international projects which cou|d add 5O Mi|lion to the bottom-|ine or

the 13.00 range without any future business expansion.
5.	GEEC is expected to fi|e for a higher exchange |isting and continue

Wor|dwide Market Potentia| 15 to 25 Bi||ion over next 5 years with no 
other known company that can match their technology, |eadership, or 
exp|osive sales growth.

Up unti| now GEEC has been one of Wal| Street's best kept secrets, yet 
now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the re|ease of this 
new Investor Awareness Campaign shou|d be exce||ent timing in regards 
to 
some new PR's forthcoming which will Rocket GEEC. This power-p|ay has 
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's sti|| a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated re|ease of huge news announcements will add to the 
buying frenzy from investors loading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
