We need to decide what we are going to do for Thanksgiving pretty soon.  I have one small problem related to going somewhere for the holiday...  I just found out that I will only get paid once a month.  Therefore I will be in a bit of a cash crunch until Nov 30th.

I hope you have a better day today sweetie...
