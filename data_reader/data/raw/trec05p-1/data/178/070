Viagra is a prescription drug used to treat erection difficulties, such as erectile dysfunction (ED). Since it first became available in 1998, the prescription drug Viagra has helped about 16 million men around the world to improve their sex lives. Amazing, 9 tablets are dispensed every second worldwide. And no other therapy or prescription drug for erectile dysfunction has been studied as much or has the same amount of real-world experience as Viagra since its launch. It's no wonder more than 600,000 doctors have chosen the prescription drug Viagra for their patients with ED. Fact is, when taken correctly, Viagra works for most men. Studies show that it works for up to 4 out of 5 men (versus 1 out of 4 on sugar pill). Viagra improves erections for most men no matter how long they have had ED, what caused it, how often they have it, or how old they are.
