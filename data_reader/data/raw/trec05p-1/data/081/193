Hood To Coast Relay 2002

Enron North America will be sponsoring a Hood to Coast Relay Team for next year's competition (Aug. 23 & 24, 2002). The event, starting at Timberline and ending in Seaside,  is a great challenge and a lot of fun.  The team will be composed of 12 Enron employees, so if you are interested in participating in North America's most popular relay, spending a day and a half with your fabulous unshowered co-workers, eating bagels and bananas, and running on little if any sleep, or have a simply brilliant idea for a team name, please reply no later that October 20th.  For more details on the event, visit www.hoodtocoast.com.  
Run On.................................. Serena Bishop
