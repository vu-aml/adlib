Subject: FROM PRINCESS TRUSTING TO HEAR FROM YOU SOONEST

PRINCESS MONICA HARRY MARSHALL.

Greetings, am writing this letter in confidence believing that if it 
are the wish of God for you to help my Mother and me. God Almighty 
will bless and reward you abundantly and you would never regret this. 
I am princess Monica Harry Marshall 27 years old a student in the 
University of Lagos Nigeria in the city of Lagos. I am the only 
Daughter of Dr Marshall Harry from the Southern part of Nigeria, Port 
Harcourt Rivers State, in EMENE VILLAGE, one of the biggest towns 
where oil is been produced in the country.

My father was a contractor to the Chevron Petroleum Oil company, From 
the year 1999 to 2002 he was one of the member Board of Trustee to 
NIGERIA NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION (NNPC). Under Mr. Jackson 
E.Gaius Obeseki (JP) Group Managing Director (NNPC) And as an elected 
chief in our community he was also directed to be in charge over the 
fund realized from the SHELL PETROLEUM
DEVELOPMENT COMPANY (SPDC) and Chevron oil company operating in our 
locality for the compensation of our youth and community development 
in our jurisdiction. In month of Feb 14, 2003 he was appointed as a 
chairman ALL NIGERIA PEOPLES PARTY (ANPP), to become the Senate 
President for the year 2007. But today, it was a thing of sorrow and 
tears that my father was been murdered by the Assassins right in his 
room at his Villa at Abuja Capital Territory( FCT) in march 5th 2003. 
My father died as a result of political Gang up in our nation.

Then after the burial of my Father, It was a thug of war between my 
mother and the family members of my late father, who was after his 
wealth and properties, they made our life to be a threat as to 
eliminate me since my father has no son who can take charge over his 
properties and wealth. Now they have succeeded in taking over his 
properties he has. But I still give thanks to Almighty God that my 
late fathers lawyer could be of a good Samaritan to tell me and my 
mother about the money my late Father deposited with the
STANDARD TRUST BANK OF NIGERIA PLC (STB) In which we hope to invest 
this fund in to REAL ESTATE BUSINESS in any foreign country abroad. 
Now the lawyer has given me a go ahead to be in search of a faithful 
and trustworthy person who will stand for us as a next of kin to this 
sum of? (52, 000.000.00euro) Fifty two million Euro only). That was 
been deposited with the STANDARD TRUST BANK PLC. As the lawyer of my 
late father who holds the vital documents that covers this said fund, 
have agreed to put the said person in the position as the next 
beneficiary to  this deposited money.

As I have discussed with my mother where she is in a hide out, and 
she agreed with me to sign an agreement and to give the said person 
who will endeavor time and effort in transferring of this 52, Million 
EURO D. In to a foreign account 30% of this said money. We will also 
entrust our own share of 70% in to his care, to invest this in any 
profitable area in his assistance.

Please kindly reach me through my private email address and telephone 
number, so that I will link you to my late father attorney. Please 
bear this In mind that this transaction is 100% risk free and please 
keep it confidential due to the amount involved. I hope to hear from 
you soonest please and will like you to send to me your full name and 
house address and country telephone/fax number for easy communication 
in this transaction.
