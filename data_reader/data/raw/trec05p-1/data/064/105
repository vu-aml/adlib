Steven - 

Please find attached the scorecard for the Power Validation/Reconciliation
Project.  In the scorecard, there are two important notes related to the
reconciliation effort and the collection of paper documentation.  We can
discuss these further on Monday if you wish, although I think that you are
already informed of these.

Additionally, since we are still working out the metrics on throughput, the
relation to fees consumption is not noted.  

Talk to you on Monday.
