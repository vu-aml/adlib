Amy, since the Netco employee's would be terminating off of Enron's Payroll they would still have access to converting the current life insurance coverages with Enron over to an individual policy with Metlife as long as they complete the conversion form within 31 days of losing their coverage.  They would then have to pay for this expense out of pocket.

Thanks, Tony

     Hi Tony......
     
     Unfortunately, I dont think so, since the employees are not 
     transferring.  They are considered to be new hires.   As a result, the 
     carrier will request their usual EOI requirements.   They typically 
     require a blood sample and urine sample.  Pending the results of those 
     tests, they may request a physical.
     
     Thanks Tony.
     
     Vince

Vince, we have a question from one of our employees that has an optional life in
surance policy for $1,064,000.00.  The employee currently has a base pay of $185
,004.00.  A clause in the UBS Optional Life Insurance policy states  "evidence o
f insurability is required for coverage of over 3 times your base salary or $700
,000, whichever is less."   What will this employee need to keep their coverage 
at approximately the same level during the transition to UBS?  Would a confirmat
ion statement from Enron for 2002 Open Enrollment elections suffice as 
"evidenceof insurability"?
     
Thanks, Tony Jarrett
