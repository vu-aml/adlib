I've made a tentative reservation on Continental to leave Thursday, Dec. 20,
at 5:50 pm, stop in Cleveland (no change) and arrive in Houston at 10:33 pm.
Return (first class!) on Sunday, Dec. 30, at 10:50 am, change in Cleveland,
and arrive Manchester at 5:03 pm. How about making a reservation to fly back
with me (you can always cancel) and return whenever. It cheers me just to
know that you'd even consider this. You need the break and I could use the
company!! I know you'd love Deb (friend/tenant) and she you, and ditto for
Gracie. Let me know your thoughts.
Love,
Sandy
