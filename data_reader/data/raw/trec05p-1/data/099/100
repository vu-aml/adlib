 	  	 Dear Andrew,

The Washington bureau will bring us more on the EPA decision to recommend changes to the nation's fuel specifications on Thursday. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says the proposal to reduce the number of boutique fuels across the country will likely draw mixed reaction. 

We'll have the latest on energy legislation from the Senate. There continues to be mixed signals coming from both parties on the likelihood of a deal that could pave the way for a comprehensive energy bill to reach the floor. 

Also in Washington, a long list of energy influentials will speak at the Alliance to Save Energy's Summit on Energy Efficiency. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman and S. David Freeman, the Chairman of California's new state power authority are among the scheduled participants. We'll have coverage of the Summit from the Washington bureau on Thursday. 

Houston has long been called the energy capital of the world and downtown Houston has always been considered the energy corridor. Now the Woodlands, a community located north of Houston, is staking its claim as the next energy corridor of the area. On Thursday the Woodlands Chamber of Commerce is hosting an energy forum to discuss the area's growth and ways to attract more companies. We'll bring you details from the Houston bureau tomorrow. 

We'll take a rare look Thursday into the largest nuclear power plant in Texas. South Texas Project Electric Generating Station invited members of the news media to tour secured areas as nuclear plants around the country upgrade security in light of the threats and attacks on America. 

Also from the Houston bureau on Thursday, Simmons & Company International Vice President of Research Mark Meyer will drop by to discuss how oil stocks are doing this quarter. Catch Meyer during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast. 

The California Public Utilities Commission is meeting on Thursday. West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says the agenda may include the Rate Agreement between the CDWR and the PUC along with the issue of Direct Access. 

Kym also reports, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District is boosting its capacity. This move will add to what is already the largest utility-owned distributed photovoltaic system in the world. Kym will bring us details on Thursday. 

Finally from the West Coast bureau, we'll have comments from California Governor Gray Davis' Press Secretary Steve Maviglio on the federal government's plans to expand Path 15. Join us for these stories from the West Coast bureau tomorrow. 

From ENL Headquarters on Thursday, Williams Energy Partners L.P. Chief Financial Officer Don Wellendorf will join us to discuss the company's third-quarter earnings. And Edward Jones Senior Energy Analyst Zach Wagner will join us from St. Louis to continue the discussion on earnings. Wagner will discuss Enron during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow. 

Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. 

Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.
