Dear Sir/Madam,

Assalamualaikum!

It is my humble pleasure to write you this mail irrespective of the fact
that you do not know me.
Forgive me for the rather unorthodox way of contact however; I am Mr. Abb=
as
Abacha the Third son of MRS. MARYAM ABACHA, the former first lady and wif=
e
of the late GEN. SANI ABACHA, the former head of state and Commander in c=
hief
of the armed forces of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria. 

Due to the fact that the British government is trying to hand over my fam=
ily
bank accounts to the Nigerian government. My mother (MRS. M. ABACHA), has=
,
as a
result of the trust and confidence she has in me,mandated that I search f=
or
a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner, who will help receive some fu=
nds,
which we have in cash totaling US$150m (One Hundred and Fifty Million Uni=
ted
States Dollars Only) into a personal, company or any reliable foreign ban=
k
account for safe keeping for a short period of time, since our family ban=
k
accounts within and outside the country
have all been frozen by the authorities. (I would refer you to these few
Websites for further
information about these monies and my family)

http://www.jubilee2000uk.org/worldnews/africa/nigeria200502.htm

This money in question has however, been carefully deposited with a secur=
ity
company in Overseas with the help of our family lawyer. You may therefore=

be required to travel to Overseas to collect the money on behalf of my fa=
mily
for safekeeping.It may also interest you to know that my mother (MRS.ABAC=
HA)
and some of our family members have,since the inception of the present de=
mocratic
government, been placed under partial house arrest, with their internatio=
nal
passports withdrawn pending the resolution of current fund recovery face
- off between them and the present RTD GEN. OBASANJO led Federal Governme=
nt,
which from
all indications will not exceed this year.We have decided to offer you 35=
%
of the total sum, while 5% shall be set aside for incidental expenses. 
Note,this transaction involves no risks whatsoever,as you will have no de=
aling
with my
country, Nigeria. Rather, you will deal directly with the Security Compan=
y
in Overseas. Let me have your confidential Tele/ Fax and mobile Numbers a=
nd
also a contact address of yours,I will send to you some of our pictures a=
nd
my mother's picture too, I shall let
you know complete picture of this mutually beneficial transaction and how=

to contact the security company in Overseas when I have received your ant=
icipated
positive reply. This matter should be treated as urgent and confidential.=


Best Regards,

Mr. Abbas Abacha
