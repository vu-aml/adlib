Dear Sir,

REMITTANCE OF US$138,000,000.00:

I am Alhaji Hamza, Foreign Operations Director of COAST
AFRICAN BANK PLC.  Since my assumption of office on
appointment by the present Board of the Bank, I have been
able to ream the image of this Bank by off-setting most
over due payments owed by the Federal Government of Nigeria
to foreign contractors in the past years.

On the process of these payments, I discovered through
investigation that my predecessor attempted to move out the
above-mentioned sum outside Nigeria but was unable as he
was removed out of office unaware, Now, I have concluded
all necessary arrangements for the smooth transfer of the
money to your account on trust, that is why I am Contacting
you on this issue. I am doing this on your good integrity
and trustworthiness as a Foreigner.

The fund originated from the balance of an over-invoiced
sum of which the principal sum had been paid to foreign
company that executed the contract some years ago. This
fund has been floating in a suspense account with COAST
AFRICAN BANK PLC for a long period of time and I as the
Director of Foreign Operations Department of COAST AFRICAN
BANK PLC in the course of my duty discovered this fund and
decided to transfer it outside Nigeria through a
trust-worthy partner.

Therefore, what is required from you is to let me know you
are capable of assisting me to get this money trasferred
outside the country in your name.

This transaction is risk free and will be concluded within
14 working days and the money be remitted into any
nominated bank account. 

Please if you are interested in this deal, do not hesitate
to let me know in time and send me your full names,
address, phone and fax numbers for easy commnunications.

Thanks in advance for a mutual and fruitful business
association.

Truly yours

Alhaji Hamza
