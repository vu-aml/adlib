STRONG BUY
Target Price: 54.00 (US$)
Dynegy Inc. (DYN)
ENE Deal Shows Risk Coverage & Est & Valuation Upside

Summary

After the close on Friday, DYN confirmed that it would acquire Enron (ENE, 8.63,
Strong Buy) for 0.2685 DYN shares plus assumption of debt and an equity infusion
of $2.5 billion. This values ENE at $10.40 per share based on DYN's Friday
close.

Our initial analyses show the merger to be additive to pro-forma '02 eps for DYN
by 25% to $3.25-$3.30 vs our current estimate of $2.55. We estimate the deal
multiples as about 7x '02 eps, 3.2x '02 cash flow, 0.85x book value and 5x
EV/EBITDA based on our revised '02 estimates for ENE.

We would note that DYN has projected a pro-forma '02 of $3.40-$3.50 per share
before cost savings and synergies.

We expect the deal to close in 9-12 months pending reviews by the SEC, FTC, FERC
and state PSCs. Despite the size of the combined company, we do not expect major
divestitures or closing issues because of the lack of asset concentration and
the inherent competitiveness of the natural gas and power marketing business.

In a report dated Nov 5, we valued ENE at $31 per share. In our view, the deal
valuation includes a differential of $20 per share or $17 billion to account for
ENEs related party and accounting issues. Because these issues threatened ENEs
core businesses, the timing and valuation of the deal for DYN is extraordinarily
attractive. We consider alternate bids for ENE to be possible under these
circumstances.

We expect DYN and other energy merchants to benefit from the removal of risk
that ENE would be downgraded below investment grade or file for bankruptcy
protection.

Pending additional information from conference calls, analyst meetings and other
deal related filings; we are maintaining our reported eps ests for DYN of $2.10
for '01 and $2.55 for '02. Our ENE ests are $1.80 for '01 and $1.60 for '02.
These estimates assume the deal closes in 4Q'02.
