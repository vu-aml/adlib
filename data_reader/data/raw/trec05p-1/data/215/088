Raymond -

Since I have not seen any other responses to your e-mail, I am concerned.

In item 1 of your email, what I think you describe here sounds like NERC's
"functional model" or what came out of the CACTF work.  In that model they
said that check-out was only between GCAs and LCAs - intermediate CAs
(balancing authorities) would not need to know of the wheel throughs.
However, the TP function(s) from source to sink would need to see the tag to
manage their respective transmission assets.

I hope that what is described here is not NERC's functional model.  My
control area, too, is not prepared to change check-out and accounting
procedures suggested in the CACTF's work.

Perhaps, embedded in the 1.7 registry tables there are pointer's to/from TPs
to/from CAs and this is why intermediate CAs are optional in OATI's tag
agent.  However, as you point out, there is not a one-to-one correspondence
of TP to CA or vice-versa within the WSCC.  I hope that there are experts
out there that can answer this item and tell us every thing is going to be
all right.

Items 2 & 3 seem to touch on a current debate going on in the NERC IS and
TISWG email forums on extensions of tags.  From those discussions, one thing
seems to be clear, once a tag reaches its stop hour and that transaction
ends, it is considered finished or in 1.7 speak, Dead.  It can not be
restarted or extended.  However when where how much an extension be for is
still be debated.  

Hope the answers come soon, seems a bit late in the game to have so much
uncertainty out there.
