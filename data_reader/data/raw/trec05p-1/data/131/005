Dear Haas Community,

  Sunday, November 18th, between 8:00 AM and noon, several servers will be 
shut down for a variety of  maintenance actions, including installation of 
new anti virus software. The servers affected will include the NT web 
server WEB,  the file servers HCS-DATA and HCS-DATA2, the logon profile 
server HCS-MASTER, the personal web site servers FACULTY and STUDENTS,  and 
several other non critical servers.  Most of the outages will be of short 
(30 minutes or less) duration.

  When WEB is down, web access to all NT based Web sites, including the 
EDULINK Career Services, Registration, and Admissions modules, Reserve, 
Event Center, group sites, course sites, and Helpdesk will be 
interrupted.   While FACULTY and STUDENTS  are being rebooted,  personal 
web sites will not be available.  While HCS-DATA , HCS-DATA2, and 
HCS-MASTER, are down, logon to the  Haas NT domain will be very slow, and 
roaming profiles and home directories will not be available.

Email should not be affected.

As always,  should you experience any problems with computing services 
following the maintenance, please contact the information desk in the 
Computer Center, or Helpdesk at http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu, phone 
510/642-0434.  Please note that Helpdesk is not manned on 
weekends.  Requests for help logged during the weekend will be responded to 
Monday morning.

Your patience is greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
