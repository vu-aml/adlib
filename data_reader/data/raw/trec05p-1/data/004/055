While Bob Hall has assumed the role of managing operations for Enron Americas on a daily basis, the responsibility still rests with me for the EES Wholesale assimilation for gas and power.  Beth Apollo is working closely with me in a project manager role to insure that the varied projects necessary to strengthen the operations for the EES business are well coordinated.  We are working closely with Don Black, Rogers Herndon and Jeff Richter, as well as coordinating with Anthony Dayo and Wes Colwell.  

We are initially focusing on six key projects.  There are numerous working sessions occuring each week as the project teams are beginning their work.  At the request of Rick Causey and Rick Buy, we are meeting with them once a week to give an update on progress.  

Would you like for me to give you a brief overview of the initial six key projects with a review of the timelines for each?  Just let me know and I will be glad to do that anytime.
