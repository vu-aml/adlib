FROM THE DESK OF DR.PAUL SAMSON.
BILL AND EXHANGE UNIT
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK(ADB)
OUAGADOUGOU-BURKINA FASO.

        URGENT ASSISTANCE IN TRANSACTION

I am the manager at the bill and exchange department bank of 
african(ADB)here in Ouagadougou,Burkina Faso.

                                                              In my 
department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$18.2m dollars ( USdollars)in 
an account that belonging to one of our foreign customer.Who died along with 
his entire family in Monday,31 July, 2000 in a plane crash in paris.Please 
visit this site that is one of the evidence the directors brought in other 
to swallow the money at the end of the 
day,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm"
Since we got information about his death, we have been

expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot 
release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the 
deceased as indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we 
learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him 
at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon 
this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and 
release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for 
safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we 
don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The 
banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclaimed after five years, the money will be transfered into the bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this 
business

is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe 
cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 30% of this money 
will be for you as a respect to the provision of a foriegn account ,10%will 
be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be
for me Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to 
the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this 
fund to your desiggnited bank account ,you must apply first to the bank as a 
relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of application that i 
will send to you,so i will like you to send to me your private telephone and 
faxnumber for easy and effective communication and location where in the 
money will be remitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of 
the application . I will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction 
is hitch-free and that you should
not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made 
for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive 
this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.




Dear p/s reply this email thanks
Yours Faithfully, DR.PAUL SAMSON.ADB)
