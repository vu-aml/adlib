According to E, that is indeed the case. I will roll the dice and go to Tampico (leave any valuables locked securely in your glove box). Set alarm.

Men,
 
            The final descision on the night of men will be as follows…
 
Where: Tony's Mexican (bring your own clown and accessories, please)
 
When: Thursday 2/28 at 7:15 pm.
 
We will wait until Zander is able to attend, to try the Tampico place. Would rather go w/ someone who knows the drill.
 
I am very much looking forward to seeing all of you men. 
 
                                                                                         Pig-N-a-Stinky-blanket
