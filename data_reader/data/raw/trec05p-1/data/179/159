The Austin Group Energy, L.P.
Monthly Newsletter

Let's describe a typical and recurring nightmare for generating unit
operators. It's noon on August 15, temperatures have reached the upper 90s
all week; you're well into your reserve margin to serve native load, when a
unit trips off line. Do you scramble to find replacement power at record
high prices and worry about the consequences later? Or, have you prepared
for this event?

When the degree of risk has not been quantified, fear of the unknown can
lead to restless nights, and understandably so. The financial implications
can be astounding when a unit outage occurs during a period of high spikes
in market prices.

How does this relate to the recruitment and hiring of talent within your
shop? Allow me to bring the story together. What would you do if your top
employee came to you and said, "You've been great to me and I've learned
alot, but I just accepted a job at your level right down the road and they
like me so much they want me to start tomorrow." Do you spring into 911 mode
or are you ready for this day.

Start a relationship today with The Austin Group Energy. We will keep you
aware of all available talent in your market area. These candidates are

opportunities through us to ensure confidentiality. Why would Top 5
