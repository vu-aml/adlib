Oh my...jury duty!!!  I have it penciled in for that week. (VBS) Yep, I 
remember we did that...end of Children's ministry meeting...had a brain cram. 
Sorry. I will let Bobbie and Ange know so they can be there to hear the info. 
Guess I was getting over anxious.  Thanks for letting me know!
In Him,
Patty
