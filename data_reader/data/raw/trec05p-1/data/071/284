Hi Eric.Bass, 
<p>
A depressed person may also dwell on negative thoughts, focus on unpleasant experiences, describe themselves as a failure, report that things are hopeless, and feel as though they are a burden to others. The changes in mood brought on by depression frequently result in feelings of sadness, irritability, anger, emptiness, and/or anxiety. There are also some types of depression, including Bipolar Disorder, in which depressive episodes alternate with manic or hypomanic episodes which may include feelings of agitation and euphoria. A severe or long-term depressive episode can substantially erode self-esteem and may result in thoughts of death and suicide.
