Please give my child to someone else.  I am sorry to do this, but I was just canned by Enron with no notice.

We have been denied the right by community affairs up to this point.  I have talked with Cindy Olson's office and, Misha Siegel in community affairs and they said that they needed to wait until Fridays total count before a decision was made to send this notice out.

Can you put out a company wide email letting people know about this?  If you already have, can you resend it?   It will help build awareness.
 
Thanks,

I plan on dropping off my purchases tomorrow.  I have purchased everything on the list already.  I am dropping it off early in case I am not here very much longer.

Please be advised that due to such a low response to Enron Kids at this trying time for all Enron employees, the board has made a decision to eliminate the purchase of shoes and a jacket for each child.  This was done to try and guareentee that every child will be adopted and that the Enron Kids board has the funds necessary to cover the children not picked after Friday.  After three days Enron Kids have only 128 children choosen out of 468 total students in Gordon Elementary.
This decision was not considered lightly, the board is very committed to this project and hopes that this reduction will allow employees to maybe adopt an additional child with this savings.  The other alturnatives were for total eleminate, or just purchase a toy and a book for each student.  Enron Kids board is hoping to make this adjustment to guarantee that the entire school is handled by the Dec 14th deadline.  If anyone has questions or concerns feel free to call
 
Geneva Davis  X 55652 or
Kevin Hyatt X 35559 or
Lesli Campbell  X 35983 or
Lillian Villarreal  X 37092 or
Pam Rush  X 58724
 
Also I have requested that Community Affairs please allow Enron Kids to put out a request across e-mail, we hope this will come out tomorrow morning,  see attached
