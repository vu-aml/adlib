Vijay,

I have not received anything.  However, Sara may have--but she is out of the office today and will be back on Monday.

Have a pleasant weekend.

Sara and Susan,

Thank you for sending your draft Paragraph 13.  I've looked it over and
wanted to follow up on whether you've received terms from your Credit Dept.

Thanks,

	Mr. Suchdev,

	Attached is our sample form of Paragraph 13, which supplements the
ISDA
	Credit Support Annex boilerplate.   Once Credit has furnished us
with
	the terms under a Credit Worksheet, we will be able to provide a
version
	which includes the credit features.

	Hope this helps in the interim.
