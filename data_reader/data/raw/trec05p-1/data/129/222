NFL Reports Player Updates 	
Latest NFL Player News - Provided by Commissioner.COM

Erron Kinney <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Kinney is listed as questionable for Sunday's game because of a calf injury. He missed Monday's game because of the injury. 

Frank Wycheck <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Anorexic Drunks Updated 11/14/01
Titans' head coach Jeff Fisher told The Nashville Tennesean that Wycheck's sprained ankle is not a substantial injury. Wycheck suffered the injury Monday, but is expected to play in Sunday's game.

Shad Meier <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=235120&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Meier is still recovering from thumb surgery and is questionable for Sunday's game. He would have gotten substantial playing time Monday against Baltimore had he played, but won't be needed now that the Titans have two healthy tight ends. 

Amos Zereoue <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Zereoue is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. He has been sidelined for almost a month because of a shoulder injury. 

Damon Jones <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
An MRI on Jones' injured shoulder didn't reveal any structural damage. However, his status for Sunday's game remains uncertain. 

Mike McMahon <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
According to published reports, the Lions hope to give McMahon some limited action during upcoming games. He is not expected to play full-time, but this development means that! C! harlie Batch might lose some playing time, hurting his overall Fantasy value.

Byron Chamberlain <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1496&>, TE MIN - Clubbers Updated 11/14/01
An MRI revealed a small cartilage tear in Chamberlain's right knee, but he is not expected to require surgery. All signs point to him playing Monday against the Giants, so feel free to use him this week.

Freddie Jones <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1843&>, TE SD - Manchester United Updated 11/14/01
The San Diego Union-Tribune says Jones (ankle) has been advised against playing this week. Results of an MRI exam are not available yet, but Steve Heiden is expected to start in his place.

Tim Dwight <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=12340&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Dwight (lung) is doubtful for Sunday's game. He has not been very healthy when productive, so don't count on him for much production from him during the rest of the season.

Troy Hambrick <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=194768&>, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Hambrick is dealing with a rotator cuff injury, but he's expected to practice later in the week. He'll like! ly! start his third consecutive game this weekend if Emmitt Smith's knee isn't 100 percent by Friday. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Mandeville Marriage Updated 11/14/01
Smith (knee) is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Philadelphia. If he is unable to go, Troy Hambrick would likely start his third straight game, barring any further damage to his injured shoulder. 

Chris Weinke <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Weinke (shoulder) was only able to throw on the sidelines Tuesday, but was expected to practice on Wednesday. If he is unable to play, Matt Lytle would likely make his second consecutive start. 

Peyton Manning <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=12531&>, QB IND - Dirty Bastards Updated 11/14/01
The Indianapolis Star says Manning had a splint inserted to stabilize the teeth in his lower jaw. He is expected to start on Sunday.

Drew Bledsoe <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1041&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Bledsoe has been cleared to play, but Tom Brady will start against the Rams. Bledsoe said he will try ! an! d prove he is ready to play by performing well in practice, but it doesn't appear likely he will get a chance to start. But the future past Week 10 appears to be unclear, and there is no guarantee Brady will hold onto the job past the Rams game.

O.J. McDuffie <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1246&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
McDuffie is ready to return to practice from the PUP list. He will be eligible for activation on Dec. 4, but he may still miss the rest of the season.

Aaron Brooks <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=133233&>, QB NO - Clubbers Updated 11/14/01
According to published reports, many veterans on the New Orleans roster have expressed their displeasure with Brooks' inconsistency this season. The reports also stated that those same veterans would rather see Jeff Blake under center, but that doesn't seem likely to happen. The coaching staff feels as though Brooks has the talent to be a top-notch NFL quarterback, so don't expect a change under center any time soon. 

Cowboys <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=8&>, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Linebacker Dexter Coakley is expected to miss two weeks of action due to a sprained knee. He suffered the injury during last weekend's loss to Atlanta. Dallas' defense has played well, but they're an inconsistent unit from a Fantasy perspective. 

Jon Hilbert <http://football434.fanta! sy! .nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=195687&>, K NO - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Hilbert has been signed by the Dallas Cowboys, and will serve as their starting kicker in Tim Seder's absence. Hilbert's value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point, however, so don't bother picking him up outside of deeper leagues. 

Tim Seder <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=196725&>, K DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Seder is expected to miss several weeks of action after injuring his ankle last Sunday against Atlanta. The team has signed former New Orleans booter Jon Hilbert to take over the kicking duties in Dallas. 

Rob Moore <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Moore, who had hamstring surgery two weeks ago, will begin some light running on Wednesday. His status for the rest of the season is still unclear, however, so don't bother picking him up off the waiver wire. 

Terry Hardy <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=12423&>, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Hardy (shoulder) is expected to miss a few more weeks of action. Unless you play in a very deep league, holding onto him isn't advisable at this point. 

Terry Allen <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodr! ow! s&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Manchester United Updated 11/14/01
Allen will be sidelined four to six weeks because of a fractured left hand. He suffered the injury in Monday's game. Jason Brookins will start in his absence.

Steve McNair <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
McNair will wear a cast on his throwing hand for at least a day after aggravating an injury during Monday night's 16-10 loss to Baltimore. He had X-rays and other tests on his right hand Tuesday, and coach Jeff Fisher said the results were negative. But doctors found an apparent hairline break in McNair's thumb, which he originally hurt last season in practice. He is questionable for Sunday's game. "We put him in a cast until tomorrow [Wednesday]. We'll see how he is with some soft tosses going with the hand," Fisher said. 

Ricky Watters <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Bees Updated 11/13/01
According to the Seattle Times, Watters is expected to return from his shoulder injury in two weeks. However, he is not guaranteed to reclaim the starting running back job with Shaun! A! lexander performing so well. We recommend you hold onto both players until it becomes clear which one will get the starts over the second half of the season, although we're betting it will be Alexander.

Rod Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Dirty Bastards Updated 11/13/01
Smith predicted Monday that he will be able to return from a sprained right ankle in time for Sunday's game against Washington. If he can't go, Keith Poole would become Denver's top receiving option, with Chris Cole, Scottie Montgomery and Kevin Kasper also filling in. However, Poole is already expected to replace Eddie Kennison as the team's second wideout.

Edd! ie! Kennison <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1296&> , WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Kennison returned to the Broncos Monday and informed them that he is "unretiring," according to the Denver Post. While this is a radical turnaround from his message of retirement over the weekend, he might not be welcomed back by the team as a result of his change of decision. It is unclear whether Kennison will be placed on the reserve/suspended list or reinstated to the roster, but either way it's highly unlikely he will be able to help any Fantasy teams the remainder of the season. Drop him.

Cameron Cleeland <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=12277&>, TE NO - Team Sensitive Updated 11/13/01
According to published reports, Cleeland won't be available for Sunday's game against Indianapol! is! . His high ankle sprain still hasn't healed sufficently, so look for Boo Williams and Lamont Hall to get the majority of the playing time in his absence. 

Santana Moss <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Moss is expected to make his season debut Sunday against Miami. He has been sidelined all season with a knee injury but is listed as probable for Sunday's game.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Chrebet is expected to play Sunday, despite suffering from a shoulder injury. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 Fantasy recei! v! er. 

Fred Taylor <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/13/01
Taylor is expected to play Sunday against Pittsburgh. He has been sidelined for over a month because of a groin injury.

Manchester United Player News - Provided by Commissioner.COM

Terry Allen <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-n! ew! s&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1177&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/14/01
Allen will be sidelined four to six weeks because of a fractured left hand. He suffered the injury in Monday's game. Jason Brookins will start in his absence.

Freddie Jones <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1843&>, Reserve TE Updated 11/14/01
The San Diego Union-Tribune says Jones (ankle) has been advised against playing this week. Results of an MRI exam are not available yet, but Steve Heiden is expected to start in his place.

Jeff Garcia <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=146325&>, Active QB Updated 11/13/01
Garcia made it through another game using a brace to protect his sprained knee, and had no problems afterwards. Head Coach Steve Mariucci is optimistic that Garcia will be able to play without the brace soon. 

Edgerrin James <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=133320&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/12/01
James will miss at least two more games with a knee injury. James practiced late in the week after his injury but felt some swelling and stiffness in his left knee. Further tests showed ligament damage. "Our doctors felt it was appropriate to shut him down for another two or three weeks," Colts president Bill Polian said Monday. "They're not certain what the severity is." Some published reports say James might miss the rest of the season.

Lamar Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1160&>, Active RB Updated 11/11/01
The Colts' defense held Smith to 53 yards on 18 carries. Rookie Travis Minor rushed for 71 yards and a TD (56 yards), and now there will be rampant speculation that Smith might be fading as a Fantasy player.

Garrison Hearst <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1164&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/11/01
Hearst had solid game against New Orleans, compiling 160 scrimmage yards on Sunday. He seems to have established himself as San Francisco's featured back in recent weeks, which is keeping Kevan Barlow's Fantasy value at a minimum. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1203&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/11/01
Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. If the quarterback situation in Carolina doesn't improve, however, Muhammad could have a tough time being productive the rest of the season. 

Marvin Harrison <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1231&>, Active WR Updated 11/11/01
Harrison scorched the Dolphins for nine receptions, 174 yards and three TDs. No defense is the league can contain Harrison when he plays in front of the home crowd.

Dominic Rhodes <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=236986&>, Active RB Updated 11/11/01
Rhodes left Sunday's game in the first quarter with a dislocated left shoulder. He was replaced by Kevin McDougal, and returned in the second quarter.

Vinny Testaverde <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1007&>, Reserve QB Updated 11/08/01
The Kansas City defense is definitely vulnerable to the pass, but the Jets haven't been throwing the ball enough to please Fantasy leaguers. Don't start Testaverde unless your team is very thin at QB.

Tim Brown <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1267&>, Active WR Updated 11/08/01
Brown caught three passes for 47 yards against the Seahawks in the teams' first meeting this year. He should perfom better if Seattle pays more attention to Jerry Rice (two TDs in first meeting) in this week's matchup. 

Jay Riemersma <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1662&>, Active TE Updated 11/04/01
Riemersma had five catches for 46 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's game against Indianapolis. He has put up decent yardage numbers for a tight end, but the TD against the Colts was his first of the season. 

Matt Stover <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1377&>, Active K Updated 10/25/01
Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent him from kicking off but he will be able to kick field goals, according to published reports. The injury isn't considered serious but the Ravens are considering Steve Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs. 

Germane Crowell <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=12306&>, Injured WR Updated 10/24/01
The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.

Deuce McAllister <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=235228&>, Reserve RB Updated 09/02/01
McAllister rushed for 108 yards on 19 carries, all in the first half, had a 36-yard punt return in the second half, and caught four passes for 20 yards during Saturday's preseason finale. "That was probably the best he's run the whole year," Saints Head Coach Jim Haslett said. "I don't think he's where he should be yet, but we're just starting to see what he can do." While McAllister won't be the Saints' starting running back likely at all this season, he might be a good insurance policy for Ricky Williams owners in Fantasy leagues.

Packers <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=11&>, Active DT Updated 08/09/01
The Packers signed free agent defensive tackle James Grier on Wednesday and released defensive tackle Carl Bradley. Bradley had arthroscopic knee surgery Tuesday and would have been unavailable to the team for an unspecified amount of time. 

Morten Andersen <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1376&>, Reserve K Updated 11/06/00
Andersen had a dull day Sunday as he did not attempt a field goal in the game against Tampa Bay. He did however manage to kick two extra points. Andersen has made 16-of-22 field goal attempts this season.

NFL Reports Player Updates 	
Latest NFL Player News - Provided by Commissioner.COM

Erron Kinney <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Kinney is listed as questionable for Sunday's game because of a calf injury. He missed Monday's game because of the injury. 

Frank Wycheck <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Anorexic Drunks Updated 11/14/01
Titans' head coach Jeff Fisher told The Nashville Tennesean that Wycheck's sprained ankle is not a substantial injury. Wycheck suffered the injury Monday, but is expected to play in Sunday's game.

Shad Meier <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=235120&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Meier is still recovering from thumb surgery and is questionable for Sunday's game. He would have gotten substantial playing time Monday against Baltimore had he played, but won't be needed now that the Titans have two healthy tight ends. 

Amos Zereoue <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Zereoue is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. He has been sidelined for almost a month because of a shoulder injury. 

Damon Jones <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
An MRI on Jones' injured shoulder didn't reveal any structural damage. However, his status for Sunday's game remains uncertain. 

Mike McMahon <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
According to published reports, the Lions hope to give McMahon some limited action during upcoming games. He is not expected to play full-time, but this development means that! C! harlie Batch might lose some playing time, hurting his overall Fantasy value.

Byron Chamberlain <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1496&>, TE MIN - Clubbers Updated 11/14/01
An MRI revealed a small cartilage tear in Chamberlain's right knee, but he is not expected to require surgery. All signs point to him playing Monday against the Giants, so feel free to use him this week.

Freddie Jones <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1843&>, TE SD - Manchester United Updated 11/14/01
The San Diego Union-Tribune says Jones (ankle) has been advised against playing this week. Results of an MRI exam are not available yet, but Steve Heiden is expected to start in his place.

Tim Dwight <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=12340&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Dwight (lung) is doubtful for Sunday's game. He has not been very healthy when productive, so don't count on him for much production from him during the rest of the season.

Troy Hambrick <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=194768&>, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Hambrick is dealing with a rotator cuff injury, but he's expected to practice later in the week. He'll like! ly! start his third consecutive game this weekend if Emmitt Smith's knee isn't 100 percent by Friday. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Mandeville Marriage Updated 11/14/01
Smith (knee) is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Philadelphia. If he is unable to go, Troy Hambrick would likely start his third straight game, barring any further damage to his injured shoulder. 

Chris Weinke <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Weinke (shoulder) was only able to throw on the sidelines Tuesday, but was expected to practice on Wednesday. If he is unable to play, Matt Lytle would likely make his second consecutive start. 

Peyton Manning <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=12531&>, QB IND - Dirty Bastards Updated 11/14/01
The Indianapolis Star says Manning had a splint inserted to stabilize the teeth in his lower jaw. He is expected to start on Sunday.

Drew Bledsoe <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1041&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Bledsoe has been cleared to play, but Tom Brady will start against the Rams. Bledsoe said he will try ! an! d prove he is ready to play by performing well in practice, but it doesn't appear likely he will get a chance to start. But the future past Week 10 appears to be unclear, and there is no guarantee Brady will hold onto the job past the Rams game.

O.J. McDuffie <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1246&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
McDuffie is ready to return to practice from the PUP list. He will be eligible for activation on Dec. 4, but he may still miss the rest of the season.

Aaron Brooks <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=133233&>, QB NO - Clubbers Updated 11/14/01
According to published reports, many veterans on the New Orleans roster have expressed their displeasure with Brooks' inconsistency this season. The reports also stated that those same veterans would rather see Jeff Blake under center, but that doesn't seem likely to happen. The coaching staff feels as though Brooks has the talent to be a top-notch NFL quarterback, so don't expect a change under center any time soon. 

Cowboys <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=8&>, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Linebacker Dexter Coakley is expected to miss two weeks of action due to a sprained knee. He suffered the injury during last weekend's loss to Atlanta. Dallas' defense has played well, but they're an inconsistent unit from a Fantasy perspective. 

Jon Hilbert <http://football434.fanta! sy! .nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=195687&>, K NO - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Hilbert has been signed by the Dallas Cowboys, and will serve as their starting kicker in Tim Seder's absence. Hilbert's value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point, however, so don't bother picking him up outside of deeper leagues. 

Tim Seder <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=196725&>, K DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Seder is expected to miss several weeks of action after injuring his ankle last Sunday against Atlanta. The team has signed former New Orleans booter Jon Hilbert to take over the kicking duties in Dallas. 

Rob Moore <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Moore, who had hamstring surgery two weeks ago, will begin some light running on Wednesday. His status for the rest of the season is still unclear, however, so don't bother picking him up off the waiver wire. 

Terry Hardy <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=12423&>, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Hardy (shoulder) is expected to miss a few more weeks of action. Unless you play in a very deep league, holding onto him isn't advisable at this point. 

Terry Allen <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodr! ow! s&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Manchester United Updated 11/14/01
Allen will be sidelined four to six weeks because of a fractured left hand. He suffered the injury in Monday's game. Jason Brookins will start in his absence.

Steve McNair <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
McNair will wear a cast on his throwing hand for at least a day after aggravating an injury during Monday night's 16-10 loss to Baltimore. He had X-rays and other tests on his right hand Tuesday, and coach Jeff Fisher said the results were negative. But doctors found an apparent hairline break in McNair's thumb, which he originally hurt last season in practice. He is questionable for Sunday's game. "We put him in a cast until tomorrow [Wednesday]. We'll see how he is with some soft tosses going with the hand," Fisher said. 

Ricky Watters <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Bees Updated 11/13/01
According to the Seattle Times, Watters is expected to return from his shoulder injury in two weeks. However, he is not guaranteed to reclaim the starting running back job with Shaun! A! lexander performing so well. We recommend you hold onto both players until it becomes clear which one will get the starts over the second half of the season, although we're betting it will be Alexander.

Rod Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Dirty Bastards Updated 11/13/01
Smith predicted Monday that he will be able to return from a sprained right ankle in time for Sunday's game against Washington. If he can't go, Keith Poole would become Denver's top receiving option, with Chris Cole, Scottie Montgomery and Kevin Kasper also filling in. However, Poole is already expected to replace Eddie Kennison as the team's second wideout.

Edd! ie! Kennison <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1296&> , WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Kennison returned to the Broncos Monday and informed them that he is "unretiring," according to the Denver Post. While this is a radical turnaround from his message of retirement over the weekend, he might not be welcomed back by the team as a result of his change of decision. It is unclear whether Kennison will be placed on the reserve/suspended list or reinstated to the roster, but either way it's highly unlikely he will be able to help any Fantasy teams the remainder of the season. Drop him.

Cameron Cleeland <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=12277&>, TE NO - Team Sensitive Updated 11/13/01
According to published reports, Cleeland won't be available for Sunday's game against Indianapol! is! . His high ankle sprain still hasn't healed sufficently, so look for Boo Williams and Lamont Hall to get the majority of the playing time in his absence. 

Santana Moss <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Moss is expected to make his season debut Sunday against Miami. He has been sidelined all season with a knee injury but is listed as probable for Sunday's game.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Chrebet is expected to play Sunday, despite suffering from a shoulder injury. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 Fantasy recei! v! er. 

Fred Taylor <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/13/01
Taylor is expected to play Sunday against Pittsburgh. He has been sidelined for over a month because of a groin injury.

Manchester United Player News - Provided by Commissioner.COM

Terry Allen <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-n! ew! s&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1177&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/14/01
Allen will be sidelined four to six weeks because of a fractured left hand. He suffered the injury in Monday's game. Jason Brookins will start in his absence.

Freddie Jones <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1843&>, Reserve TE Updated 11/14/01
The San Diego Union-Tribune says Jones (ankle) has been advised against playing this week. Results of an MRI exam are not available yet, but Steve Heiden is expected to start in his place.

Jeff Garcia <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=146325&>, Active QB Updated 11/13/01
Garcia made it through another game using a brace to protect his sprained knee, and had no problems afterwards. Head Coach Steve Mariucci is optimistic that Garcia will be able to play without the brace soon. 

Edgerrin James <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=133320&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/12/01
James will miss at least two more games with a knee injury. James practiced late in the week after his injury but felt some swelling and stiffness in his left knee. Further tests showed ligament damage. "Our doctors felt it was appropriate to shut him down for another two or three weeks," Colts president Bill Polian said Monday. "They're not certain what the severity is." Some published reports say James might miss the rest of the season.

Lamar Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1160&>, Active RB Updated 11/11/01
The Colts' defense held Smith to 53 yards on 18 carries. Rookie Travis Minor rushed for 71 yards and a TD (56 yards), and now there will be rampant speculation that Smith might be fading as a Fantasy player.

Garrison Hearst <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1164&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/11/01
Hearst had solid game against New Orleans, compiling 160 scrimmage yards on Sunday. He seems to have established himself as San Francisco's featured back in recent weeks, which is keeping Kevan Barlow's Fantasy value at a minimum. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1203&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/11/01
Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. If the quarterback situation in Carolina doesn't improve, however, Muhammad could have a tough time being productive the rest of the season. 

Marvin Harrison <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1231&>, Active WR Updated 11/11/01
Harrison scorched the Dolphins for nine receptions, 174 yards and three TDs. No defense is the league can contain Harrison when he plays in front of the home crowd.

Dominic Rhodes <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=236986&>, Active RB Updated 11/11/01
Rhodes left Sunday's game in the first quarter with a dislocated left shoulder. He was replaced by Kevin McDougal, and returned in the second quarter.

Vinny Testaverde <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1007&>, Reserve QB Updated 11/08/01
The Kansas City defense is definitely vulnerable to the pass, but the Jets haven't been throwing the ball enough to please Fantasy leaguers. Don't start Testaverde unless your team is very thin at QB.

Tim Brown <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1267&>, Active WR Updated 11/08/01
Brown caught three passes for 47 yards against the Seahawks in the teams' first meeting this year. He should perfom better if Seattle pays more attention to Jerry Rice (two TDs in first meeting) in this week's matchup. 

Jay Riemersma <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1662&>, Active TE Updated 11/04/01
Riemersma had five catches for 46 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's game against Indianapolis. He has put up decent yardage numbers for a tight end, but the TD against the Colts was his first of the season. 

Matt Stover <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1377&>, Active K Updated 10/25/01
Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent him from kicking off but he will be able to kick field goals, according to published reports. The injury isn't considered serious but the Ravens are considering Steve Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs. 

Germane Crowell <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=12306&>, Injured WR Updated 10/24/01
The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.

Deuce McAllister <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=235228&>, Reserve RB Updated 09/02/01
McAllister rushed for 108 yards on 19 carries, all in the first half, had a 36-yard punt return in the second half, and caught four passes for 20 yards during Saturday's preseason finale. "That was probably the best he's run the whole year," Saints Head Coach Jim Haslett said. "I don't think he's where he should be yet, but we're just starting to see what he can do." While McAllister won't be the Saints' starting running back likely at all this season, he might be a good insurance policy for Ricky Williams owners in Fantasy leagues.

Packers <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=11&>, Active DT Updated 08/09/01
The Packers signed free agent defensive tackle James Grier on Wednesday and released defensive tackle Carl Bradley. Bradley had arthroscopic knee surgery Tuesday and would have been unavailable to the team for an unspecified amount of time. 

Morten Andersen <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1376&>, Reserve K Updated 11/06/00
Andersen had a dull day Sunday as he did not attempt a field goal in the game against Tampa Bay. He did however manage to kick two extra points. Andersen has made 16-of-22 field goal attempts this season.
