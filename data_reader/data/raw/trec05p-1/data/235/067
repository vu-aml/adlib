ABOUT US:
SWISS Pharm INT is a healthcare company with a uniquely broad
spectrum of innovative solutions. 
For more than 5 years, we have been active in the discovery,
development, manufacture and marketing 
of novel healthcare solutions. Our products and services
address prevention, diagnosis and treatment 
of diseases, thus enhancing well-being and quality of life.
Our focus is not just the diagnosis and treatment of manifest
disease. The integrated healthcare 
approach is increasingly offering ways of identifying and
targeting diseases early, when their 
damaging effects can still be prevented.
Arranged in two operative divisions, our global mission today
and tomorrow is to create exceptional
 added value in healthcare. These two units are:

Pharmaceuticals.
Diagnostics.

SWISS Pharm INT aims to supply products and services that
significantly improve people's lives by 
helping to prevent, diagnose and treat disease.
SWISS Pharm INT is committed to a system of corporate
governance that conforms to the latest standards 
and takes due account of our corporate development. The safety
and health of our employees and the public,
as well as the protection of our neighbourhoods and the
environment, have high priority at all Group 
facilities. In all we do, we are guided by the principle of
sustainable development.
SWISS Pharm INT pioneering approach to healthcare innovation
enables us to deliver significant benefits 
to patients as well as to healthcare providers and systems. In
our vision of the future, therapies will 
be available for many of today's untreatable diseases, it will
be possible to optimize drug efficacy 
and safety, and effective strategies will be in place for
preventing disease. Early diagnosis and 
improved new treatments will significantly reduce the need for
expensive surgical operations and long 
hospital stays.
While this vision is an aspiration for the future, SWISS Pharm
INT has begun pioneering the path, with a 
wide range of products and services available to: 
determine disease predisposition provide health information
that can be acted upon to prevent or delay the onset of illness
diagnose disease
treat numerous diseases and conditions
monitor the progress of therapy

Advancing our understanding of how diseases develop and helping
people to stay healthy longer are among 
the greatest challenges currently facing medical scientists and
healthcare providers. 
In this, both our businesses can make a difference by bringing
high quality diagnostic and treatment 
options to the market. The divisions concentrate in gaining an
understanding how diseases develop and 
play a pivotal role in today’s healthcare. 

Parallel to this is what a patient knows about diseases and
medical conditions. To learn more about 
health in general, we offer various information portals which
illustrate details about health and disease 
in an entertaining and informative way.Unfortunately, we are
unable to cater for information about personal 
health concerns - specific questions regarding personal health
should be discussed with a doctor. 

Healthcare providers world-wide increasingly recognise the
power of diagnostics to reduce the cost and 
enhance the efficiency of total health management. We intend to
make a significant contribution to both. 
Our broad range of innovative diagnostic tests and systems play
a pivotal role in the groundbreaking 
area of integrated healthcare solutions and cover the early
detection, targeted screening, evaluation 
and monitoring of disease. 

This website and those which can be reached contain information
on products which is targeted to 
a wide range of audiences and could contain product details or
information otherwise not accessible 
or valid in your country. Please be aware that we do not take
any responsibility for accessing such 
information which may not comply with any valid legal process,
regulation, registration or usage in 
the country of your origin. 

At SWISS Pharm INT we invest heavily in long-term research and
development programmes aimed at 
creating new diagnostic and therapeutic options for the many
health problems facing mankind. This is 
the most important way in which we make a difference. As a
healthcare company, SWISS Pharm INT supplies 
products and services that offer real health benefits; their
effectiveness is tested in intensive 
clinical trials. Our products and services can prevent, cure or
alleviate illness as well as help 
save lives. We care about the health of every individual. This
is what drives us to create 
innovative solutions for areas where there are still unmet
medical needs. 

This is our contribution to sustainable healthcare. Our
products and services make 
it possible for patients to receive prompt and effective
treatment tailored to their 
individual requirements. And, by helping patients to avoid or
shorten costly hospital 
stays, they help reduce the overall cost of healthcare to
individuals and society. 

As a healthcare company, SWISS Pharm INT pursues a
forward-looking strategy based on 
early identification of disease predispositions, prevention,
accurate diagnosis and 
targeted treatment. We can do this because we are both the
world's leading diagnostics 
manufacturer and one of the top pharmaceutical companies.
Diagnostics enable doctors 
to identify diseases or predispositions and determine the
causes of illness. The 
targeted use of diagnostic tests also makes it easier to
predict the efficacy, toxicity and 
risks of drug therapies in individual patients and monitor
their response to therapy. Drugs 
can prevent, cure or alleviate illness. Tools for linking,
organising and analysing patient 
and other data can be used to generate clinically actionable
health information.
 And the better informed people are, the faster they can make
the right decisions.

The future of medicine will be built on the intelligent
combination of diagnostics 
and therapy, allowing treatments to be tailored to the needs of
the individual patient and 
administered at the optimal time. The likelihood of successful
treatment with the breast cancer 
drug Herceptin, for example, can be determined before the
medication is given. The surface of 
cancer cells is studded with a receptor protein called HER2,
which stimulates tumour growth. 
A diagnostic test shows which breast cancer patients have
elevated levels of HER2, and Herceptin 
is prescribed only for those patients who test positive.
HER2-positive cancers are considered 
especially hard to treat. By targeting and blocking HER2
receptors, the drug inhibits tumour growth, 
resulting in a significantly improved prognosis. Herceptin has
made SWISS PHARM INT a pioneer in 
individually tailored medicines.
