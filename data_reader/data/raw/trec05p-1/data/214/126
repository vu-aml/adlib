Shelley - 
See when Patty is available, and I will attend if I can.  All the dates you 
mentioned are possible but not certain for me, except for Sunday, which is 
bad for me. (We will not be in church this Sunday.)  I am particularly 
interested in seeing what the Children's Church curriculum looks like...
Thanks, Shelley!
Barbara
