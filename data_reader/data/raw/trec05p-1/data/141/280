Dear Lizzette:

As per our conversation this evening, I reviewed the memo.  It looks good to me.

I have one comment:  please make sure that the reference to "Code of Conduct" is revised to "Code of Ethics".  I note that it is referenced as Code of Conduct in one place and Code of Ethics in another.  As you know, the proper title is "Code of Ethics", I am sure that this was an oversight.

Thanks for giving me the opportunity to review.

Sharon

From what I understand, David Oxley walked someone out the earlier door today for posting in on an internet bulletin board.  I am trying to get details.  Did he run the termination by either of you? 

In any case, I've been told that he wants to publish a memo saying someone's been fired for breaking the rules.  I think that is a very, very bad idea.  So, I've drafted a reminder to give to David to publish instead.  Please let me know your thoughts.
