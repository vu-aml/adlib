Sally, Greg and Rick: Last week two employees in the ISC resigned. Please see summary and attached detail justification to bring back one part time contractor to cover for the resignations and support critical activities. 

Please confirm by email to approve this request. The projected total ISC labor cost will be below the approved budget with the resource changes described below. 

Summary

Two ISC Employees working in the technical services group resigned last week. Greg Bert an application developer, and Fazil Osman our most senior employee working on the SAP system infrastructure and Basis area.  

We will not replace Greg Bert at this time. We have other contractors working part time in the ISC who can increase their hours if needed to cover for Greg leaving.

We will need a replacement for Fazil Osman in order to maintain SAP system availability and service levels. 

Fazil was our most senior employee working in the SAP System Infrastructure and Basis area. The SAP System Infrastructure group is responsible for maintaining system availability, performance and backup and recovery services. 

A replacement for Fazil is needed to enable Enron to maintain expected levels of SAP system availability six days a week 24 hours a day. A reduction in SAP system availability could cause potential business disruption and affect Enron's ability to pay vendors, pay employees and manage cash. Paul Calvino a consultant with Entersys Group was previously with the ISC for two years, and was let go December 2, 2001. Paul can replace Fazil working part time 20 hours a week. Entersys is a preferred supplier and is on Enron's critical vendor list post petition. 

This is the lowest cost short-term replacement for Fazil given the difficulty, time and cost associated with recruiting an employee. Also, Paul is available to work part time for services as needed. 

Proposed Replacement: Paul Calvino - Basis Consultant 
Vendor: Entersys Group
Duration:  3/31/02 or until business needs change
Contract Rate Per Hour: $185/hr at 20 hours per week
