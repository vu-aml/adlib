Dear Friend,

After due deliberation with my children, I decided
to contact you for 
your assistance in standing as a beneficiary to
the sum of US$13 Millon (Thirteen Million United
States Dollars Only) First, let me start by
introducing myself, I am Mrs. Susan Shabangu, a
mother of three 
children and the Deputy Minister of Safety and
Security of the Republic 
of South Africa, Vice-Chairperson of the National
Labour and 
Development Institute. Member of the African
National Congress (ANC) Steering Committee,  under
the President of South Africa MR THABO MBEKI.Visit
this site for my  profile 
http://www.info.gov.za/gol/gcis_profile.jsp?id=1066
After the swearing 
in ceremony making me the Deputy Minister of
Minerals and Energy, my husband Mr Ndelebe
Shabangu died while he was on a trip to Trinidad
and Tobago in 2002.   After his death, I
discovered that
he had some funds in a dollar account which
mounted to the sum of US$13 Million with SECURITY
COMPANY.

This fund emanated as a result of an over-invoiced
contract which he 
executed with the Government of South Africa.
Though I assisted him in getting this contract but
I never knew it was over-invoiced by him. I 

am afraid that the government of South Africa
might start investigations on contracts awarded
from 1998 to date and  If they discover this money
with this security company, they will confiscate
it and seize his assets here in South Africa and
this will definetely affect my political career in
government. I want your assistance in clearing
this money from the security firm . As soon as the
fund is cleared, you are expected to move it
immediately into another personal bank account in
your country. 

I will see to it that the account is not traced
from South Africa. As 
soon as you have confirmed the fund in your
account, I will send my 
eldest son with my Attorney to come to your
country to
discuss on business investments. 

For your assistance, I am offering you 3 Million
(Three million United 
States Dollars Only) However, you have to assure
me and also be ready to go into agreement with me
that you will not elope with the money. If you
agree to my terms, kindly as a matter of urgency
send me an email. 
Due to my sensitive position in the South African
Government, I would 
not WANT you to call me on phone or send a fax to
me. All 
correspondence must be by email to my private
email.

If you want to speak with my Attorney, that is
fine and okay by me. His chambers will be
representing my interest with you. All
correspondence must be made through   my Attorney.
I will also like you to give me your contact
address of telephone, fax and email to enable my
Attorney call or reach you from time to time.
Please I do not need to remind you of the need for
absolute Confidentiality if this transaction must
succeed. Please do contact me with the
confidential email address: susubangu@yahoo.fr 

YOU MUST NOT CALL ME! If you do not feel
comfortable with this 
transaction, do not hesitate to discontinue.
Thanks for your 
anticipated co-operation and my regards to your
family.

Yours faithfully,
Mrs. Susan Shabangu.
