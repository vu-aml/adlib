Compliments,

My email to you concerns a deceased customer and an investment he 
placed under our 
establishments management. I would respectfully request that you keep 
the contents 
of this mail confidential

This is a proposal in context but soliciting for your unreserved 
assistance in carrying out 
an urgent transaction. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang 
Seng Bank Ltd.

Please you did not get this email in error; I had to search for your 
contact myself on the 
internet. What I require of you is your trust for what I want to expose 
to you.
Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client in the bank General Ibrahim 
Moussa who was with the 
Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 
calendar months, 
When the money was matured several notice was sent to him, even during 
the war. 

Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response 
came from him. We 
later I found out that the General and his family had been killed 
during the war in a bomb 
blast that hit his home.

After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim 
Moussa did not declare 
any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his 
bank deposit. And he 
also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one 
except me knew of his 
deposit in my bank.

No doubt this proposal will make you apprehensive, please I employ you 
to observe complete 
confidentiality and be assured that this transaction would be most 
profitable for both of us 
so please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters of this 
issue. 

There is no complication involved at all in the matter as we are going 
to adopt a legal
method and an attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please 
endeavor to observe 
utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. 

I will provide you with more details as soon as I receive your earliest 
response. 


Kind Regards

Mr Wang Qin.

Kindly respond to:qwang495@excite.com
