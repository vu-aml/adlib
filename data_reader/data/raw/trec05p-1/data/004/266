As you may know, we specialize in assisting emerging companies in "Going Public". We also assist with 
Private Placement preparation (for companies wanting to raise capital).

Many people are not aware that any company can go public including a startup or development stage 
company.  Please visit our site or email us to receive our Go Public Report and our Advantages of Going 
Public Report.

I wish I could convey to you, all the many benefits of going public in a brief letter.  I am not sure if you can 
imagine how valuable and powerful a public company can be in achieving your goals and objectives.

We would like to propose a joint venture with you.  If you or an associate of yours may be interested in 
taking a company public, please let us know at shaun@adminfundingconsult.com .  We are happy to pay a 
very generous referral fee.

Since we provide such an outstanding service and have a great deal of experience, you may want to pass 
this email on to an associate or you can send us their information.

Please contact us when you are ready to move forward.

Sincerely,

Shaun Anthony
