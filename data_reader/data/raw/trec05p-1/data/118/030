Please approve or make changes to their new NDA.  They need to change the counterparty name due to a joint venture.

Thanks,

Diamond-san,

As I wrote in the past, Nissho Iwai's LNG related department
has been transferred into a new joint venture company between
Nissho and Sumitomo Corp. as of October 1, 2001, namely,
 "LNG Japan Corp.".

In this connection, we would like to conclude another NDA with
LNG Japan Corp, as per attached.

Please review it and it would be great if you could make original again
and send us for Mr.Miyazawa's signature.

Also, please advise us how we should treat Nissho's NDA in these
circumstances.

BTW, I talked with Mr.Matsubara, Manager of Enron Global Finance in Tokyo.
We are internally discussing when we start our official meeting.
Please let us know when you are ready.

Regards,

LNG Japan Corporation
D.Kobayashi
