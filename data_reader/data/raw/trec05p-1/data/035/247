Dear,

We hereby inform you that after our meeting in Africa,concerning negative=

reports from all over the world about Nigeria and west African system of
money transfer,in which foreign contractors who executed contracts here
either by commission or omission,and Next of Kin funds beneficiaries are
now taken care of.As we noticed in view of transferring their funds,they
made lots of unnecessary expenses by paying money(ies) to unknown account=
s
which we refer to as imposters in order to facilitate and receive their
contracts /inheritance entitlements.
 
In respect of the above reports,we have commenced action immediately abou=
t
this issue, which made us to fight against the federal governments and au=
thorities
involved in this practices, and reach a conclusion under decree 12,quote/=

unquote section 4 sub-section 9 in decree 113 of the federal republic of
Nigeria (FRN),ECOWAS and Africa as a whole.
 
With interest,the IMF (International Monetory Fund),WB (World Bank) has
mandated the Authorities involved and other related financial institution=
s
such as CITI BANK,ZENITH BANK, AFRICAN CONTINENTAL BANK, SUB CENTRAL BANK=
S
(CBN), UNION BANK PLC,MORGAN BANK,TRADERS BANK,BANK OF AFRICA,AFRICAN DEV=
ELOPMENT
BANK etc. and other Governmental bodies on  the ugly approach encountered=

so far regarding the release of the foreigners funds. 
 
Due to the shame and issues at stake,these so called banks have brought
to Africa as a continent,we decided to sanitize and put Africa back in or=
der,
as it is before regards the above.Meanwhile,your report was passed to us
through the ICPC and CBN /CAC with report from UBN what you had gone thro=
ugh
so far as to receive your money in which unfortunately you failed to the
hands of  some imposters as a victim,with our investigations, anonymous
authorities that are involved in using a way or the other to make money
before funds transfer is made has been nabbed and charged.
 
With the situation and verifications,we are convinced that you are one of=

the beneficiaries,as your file is revealed to us here in our desk.You are=

to reconfirm to us the following before your money will be  made availabl=
e
to you
 
1. Telephone and fax numbers
2. Your occupation 
3. Details of Contract OR (explain if next of kin)
4. Amount 

As soon as we receive the above mentioned information and conclude with
our verifications,immediate action shall be taken to make sure you receiv=
e
your money through KTT service here in our paying center in BURKINA FASO.=
