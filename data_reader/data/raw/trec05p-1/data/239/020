Let's plan on the weekend of March 9th.  Maybe lunch on that Saturday or
something.  David will be out of town....  I think he's playing golf in
Toledo Bend with a group of guys.  So, either happy hour on Friday or lunch
on Sat/Sun! Whatever works for you!  Thank you for being my normal sweet
friend.
