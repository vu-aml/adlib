Cheney's 'bad cop' act in Iraq: What's really going on

-- From CNN White House Correspondent Ed Henry

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- My ears perked up when I heard one particular detail about Vice President Cheney's unannounced trip
to Baghdad on Tuesday.

Journalists traveling with the vice president reported that aboard Air Force Two en route to Iraq, someone identified
only as a "senior administration official" said Cheney's message to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki would be clear.


"We've got to get this work done. It's game time. ... Everybody's got to sit down, raise their game, redouble their
efforts," the senior administration official said.

To say that it's finally "game time" more than four years into the war is a pretty startling statement.

"The administration is becoming increasingly desperate because they know time is running out," explained Lawrence Korb,
a former Reagan Defense Department official who now works at the liberal Center for American Progress.

What's really going on here is a classic example of the White House's good-cop/bad-cop approach to thorny issues. For
months, the president has been playing the good cop -- gently prodding and coaxing Maliki along.

But now that fellow Republicans are really turning up the temperature on the White House to turn the situation around,
Cheney -- "The Enforcer" if you will -- is sent in to play bad cop and deliver the message in blunter fashion to Maliki
face-to-face.

(It was quite interesting to me that reporters on the ground in Baghdad noted they were left cooling their heels for
some 45 minutes waiting for the vice president to emerge from the Maliki meeting, which suggests to me it was a "frank
exchange" as they say in diplomatic parlance).

In public, Cheney's comments were more tactful but still pointed in noting that U.S. patience is growing thin,
especially with the Iraqi parliament planning a controversial two-month summer break.

"I did make it clear that we believe it's very important to move on the issues before us in a timely fashion, and that
any undue delay would be difficult to explain, and that we hoped they would approach these issues with all deliberate
dispatch," Cheney told reporters.

When hearing Cheney's latest progress report from Iraq, it's also important to remember that his previous predictions
have been off the mark. It was two years ago this month that the vice president told CNN's "Larry King Live": "I think
they're in the last throes, if you will, of the insurgency."

After his series of briefings with U.S. and Iraqi officials on Wednesday, the vice president declared that sectarian
violence is "down fairly dramatically" though he cautioned that there are serious security problems. "They do believe
we are making progress, but we've got a long way to go."

As if on cue, there was an explosion that rattled the windows at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad during Cheney's visit.
Reporters were raced to a basement "attack shelter" before getting the all-clear signal a few minutes later.

The vice president's schedule was not interrupted, and he proclaimed himself impressed by the answers he got from
Maliki. "I do believe there is a greater sense of urgency now than I'd seen previously."

But don't forget that last June, during the president's own unannounced visit to Baghdad, he expressed similar
confidence in Maliki. "I appreciate you recognizing the fact that the future of this country is in your hands," the
president said to Maliki then.

Nearly one year later, the future of Iraq is still in Maliki's hands -- but even Republicans admit privately the clock
is ticking.

"PATIENCE IN THE PARTY IS RUNNING OUT": House Republican moderates, in a remarkably blunt White House meeting, warned
President Bush this week that his pursuit of the war in Iraq is risking the future of the Republican Party and that he
cannot count on GOP support for many more months. The meeting, which ran for an hour and a half Tuesday afternoon, was
disclosed by participants yesterday as the House prepared to vote this evening on a spending bill that could cut
funding for the Iraq war as early as July. GOP moderates told Bush they would stay united against the latest effort by
House Democrats to end U.S. involvement in the war. Even Senate Democrats called the House measure unrealistic.

AL QAEDA "REACTING TO THE WAR DEBATE," SAYS GATES: Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates yesterday told Congress that al
Qaeda will establish a stronghold in Iraq's Anbar province if U.S. troops pull out prematurely and that the group is
reacting to the war debate in Washington by stepping up attacks. Furthermore, the entire war effort will be disrupted
unless Congress quickly passes an emergency funding bill acceptable to President Bush, he said. Mr. Gates' testimony
before the Senate Appropriations Committee preceded today's scheduled House vote on a bill that the White House
promises to veto because it rations war spending and sets up a July vote to cut off funds if progress in Iraq is
inadequate. Washington Post: War debate cited as aiding al Qaeda

NEW DOD GUIDELINES FOR WHO CAN TESTIFY: The Pentagon has placed unprecedented restrictions on who can testify before
Congress, reserving the right to bar lower-ranking officers, enlisted soldiers, and career bureaucrats from appearing
before oversight committees or having their remarks transcribed, according to Defense Department documents. Robert L.
Wilkie , a former Bush administration national security official who left the White House to become assistant secretary
of defense for legislative affairs last year, has outlined a half-dozen guidelines that prohibit most officers below
the rank of colonel from appearing in hearings, restricting testimony to high-ranking officers and civilians appointed
by President Bush. The guidelines, described in an April 19 memo to the staff director of the House Armed Services
Committee, adds that all field-level officers and enlisted personnel must be "deemed appropriate" by the Department of
Defense before they can participate in personal briefings for members of Congress or their staffs; in addition,
according to the memo, the proceedings must not be recorded. Boston Globe: Pentagon restricting testimony in Congress

GREENSBURG VISIT OFFERS "BRIEF RESPITE" FOR TORNADO VICTIMS: President Bush cheered this ravaged town on Wednesday,
vowing to put federal might behind reconstruction and giving exhausted residents a brief respite from recovery efforts
already under way. "I am struck by the character of the people here," he said. "They are willing to do what it takes to
rebuild. America is blessed to have such people." For many here, the presidential visit offered a chance to halt,
albeit briefly, the process of sifting through debris, sorting out insurance and fretting about jobs and graduation
parties. Instead they gathered in the streets - the only places one can stand — and started talking about the future.
"For him to be here, to take the time to tell us and the whole country that this is important, that means a lot," said
Eric Wright, whose home was destroyed. Kansas City Star: 'Brighter days ahead,' Bush promises town

PELOSI "REMAINS A PRIME VILLAIN TO THE GOP BASE": Firebrand Republicans would have you believe that House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi might have engaged in corruption for her husband, tried to grab a luxury "Air Force Three" jetliner for her
personal use, consorted with an American enemy in Syria and disrespected the top American general in Iraq. These and
other charges Pelosi has faced reflect the rough political atmosphere in the Capitol, and experts say that even though
the Republican allegations generally fade after a few days, they won't stop. The reason, the experts add, is that
Pelosi, as a San Francisco liberal, remains a prime villain to the GOP base. Her critics know that attacking her
rallies the faithful, and they hope that one of the charges eventually will stick and cause Pelosi serious trouble. San

REID WILL PUSH LAST YEAR'S IMMIGRATION PACKAGE TO THE FLOOR: Senate Democratic and Republican leaders were digging in
Wednesday for what could be an ugly political collapse of bipartisan efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reform,
with both sides already blaming their potential failure to pass legislation on the other's unwillingness to compromise.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) announced Wednesday afternoon that he would defy GOP filibuster threats and
attempt to force last year's Senate-passed immigration reform package to the floor next week. Reid said that bill will
act as a "framework" for the two-week debate and that he was still open to allowing the members of the bipartisan
immigration negotiating group to offer any deal they reach as a substitute amendment for the underlying bill. "We all
realize that bill is imperfect. But it's the place we're going to start," Reid said. Roll Call: Reid Set to Move Border

SENATORS PASS BILL TO CHANGE "PHILOSOPHY AND OPERATIONS" OF FDA: By a vote of 93 to 1, the Senate passed a bill on
Wednesday that would give the Food and Drug Administration new power to police drug safety, order changes in drug
labels, regulate advertising and restrict the use and distribution of medicines found to pose serious risks to
consumers. The bill calls for a fundamental change in the philosophy and operations of the drug agency, requiring it to
focus on the entire life cycle of a drug — not just the years before its approval — as well as the experience of
patients who later take it... In passing the measure, the Senate sent a clear signal that it wanted stronger action by
the agency to protect public health. Senators said the bill responded to a widespread loss of confidence in the ability
of the agency to protect consumers against the dangers of drugs like Vioxx, a popular painkiller withdrawn from the
market in 2004. New York Times: Senate Approves Tighter Policing of Drug Makers

WOLFOWITZ GETS MORE TIME TO RESPOND TO ALLEGATIONS: World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz won more time to respond to
conflict-of-interest charges as the agency's directors sought to deflect criticism they are hounding him out of office.
Wolfowitz now has two more days, until tomorrow evening, to ready his defense, the executive board of the
Washington-based agency said in a statement late yesterday. Earlier, bank directors gave him three days, over the
protests of his lawyer, who asked for a week. The board invited Wolfowitz to appear in person on May 15. Directors are
concerned that rushing a decision on Wolfowitz's future would weaken their case and antagonize the Bush administration,
said two bank officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The pause allows more time to negotiate an exit for the
former deputy defense secretary and avoid a confrontation between the U.S. and his European detractors. Bloomberg:

GONZALES "BELIEVES HE HAS WEATHERED THE STORM": Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales appears increasingly confident
that he will survive the crisis over the dismissal of federal prosecutors, as White House aides who view him as a
liability see little point in trying to persuade President Bush to push him out, administration officials and
Republican allies said. Though Mr. Gonzales is considered in Congress and in legal circles as an isolated and
diminished figure, he has told aides he believes he has weathered the storm. He is expected to testify on Thursday
before the House Judiciary Committee about his department's dismissals last year of several United States attorneys.

MO U.S. ATTORNEY FIRED IN JANUARY 2006: The former U.S. attorney in Kansas City, Mo., Todd P. Graves, said yesterday
that he was asked to step down from his job by a senior Justice Department official in January 2006, months before
eight other federal prosecutors would be fired by the Bush administration. Graves said he was told simply that he
should resign to "give another person a chance." He said he did not oppose the department's request, because he had
already been planning to return to private practice. He did appeal to Missouri's senior senator to try to persuade the
White House to allow him to remain long enough to prosecute a final, important case -- involving the slaying of a
pregnant woman and kidnapping of her 8-month fetus. Justice officials rejected the request. Washington Post: Number of
Fired Prosecutors Grows http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/09/AR2007050902718.html

TWO CAPITOL-THEMED PILOTS MAY HIT THE TUBE THIS FALL: A double dose of TV chick-lit might be headed for the Capitol, as
Washington narrows the point spread between Los Angeles and New York for most televised backdrop. Both ABC and the CW
are optioning pilots about female congressional aides for the fall 2007 schedule. "I Am Paige Armstrong" is about a
young woman who decides to run against her boss after discovering he's somewhat corrupt. The show was created by Rod
Lurie of another girl-power program, "Commander in Chief." Lurie originally took the "Paige" idea to ABC in 2002. The
network passed. Then a former ABC exec now at the CW revived the show... ABC, meanwhile, is considering "The Hill"
(working title). The tagline: "A senator's aide in Washington, D.C. falls for the daughter of his boss's rival."  The

VAGUE GUIDELINES FOR ACCEPTABLE SPEECH ON YOUTUBE, MYSPACE, FACEBOOK: Forget television executives and the FEC. The new
regulators of political speech are Sergey Brin, Rupert Murdoch and Mark Zuckerberg -the chieftains of YouTube, MySpace
and Facebook, respectively. Those sites are where you'll find many of today's hottest items of political expression -
beyond the reach of old rules and regulations, in privately controlled online communities that have welcomed political
campaigns with open arms. But although these sites have vastly expanded the fields open for political messages, they
have their limits. As political communication moves online, a new group of corporate executives and their customer
service agents have gained control of the censor's pen - in a forum where the First Amendment does not apply. The

CAMPAIGNS TRY TO CONTROL IMAGE ONLINE: Increasingly, [the Web is] a place for attacking and ridiculing candidates. And
even supporters can get a candidate in trouble, if bloggers perceived as being linked to the campaign don't stick to
campaign standards. Therefore, many campaigns are trying to put at least some controls on how they are viewed online.
For example, campaigns have tried to control what advertisements show up on search engines such as Google and Yahoo
when key phrases are typed. The campaign of former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, for example, has bid on key
words and phrases that Internet users type into search engines, in the same way that companies pay the search engines
to place ads alongside relevant search results. Boston Globe: Internet and politics an uneasy fit

RICHARDSON HITS THE IA AIRWAVES WITH INTERVIEW ADS: Usually, you don't get to sit in on someone else's job interview.
But Gov. Bill Richardson wants all the world to know his qualifications for president. So two of his new campaign ads
feature the governor in a mock job interview - nervous expression on his face included. In the first ad, the man
interviewing Richardson doesn't ask too many questions, instead ticking off the list of his qualifications. "Fourteen
years in Congress, U.N. ambassador, secretary of energy, governor of New Mexico, negotiated with dictators in Iraq,
North Korea, Cuba, Zaire, Nigeria, Yugoslavia, Kenya, got a cease-fire in Darfur, nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize
four times," the interviewer says, taking a bite of a sandwich and then talking with his mouth full. Albuquerque

ROMNEY ASKED ABOUT '94 PLANNED PARENTHOOD DONATION: GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney said Wednesday reports that
his wife donated $150 to Planned Parenthood in 1994 aren't surprising given his position on abortion at the time. "I
was effectively pro-choice at that time," said Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, during a campaign stop in
Iowa. Romney insists that while he took a pro-choice stand until a couple of years ago, he has always personally
opposed abortion. He added that his wife's donations say little about his positions on the matter. A sign of the
sensitivity surrounding Romney's abortion stance: An anti-abortion group's decision to give an award to Romney is
drawing protests from those on both sides of the issue. And the disclosure of the Planned Parenthood contribution,
first reported by ABC News, is likely to give fresh ammunition to foes already suspicious of his changed position on
the issue. AP via Yahoo! News: Romney: Wife donated to pro-choice group

FIREFIGHTERS NOT EXCITED ABOUT McCAIN, OBAMA: Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Barack Obama (D-Ill.) failed to win the
hearts or minds of the International Association of Fire Fighters at its presidential forum in mid-March, according to
a survey taken at the time, IAFF President Harold Schaitberger told The Hill. Meanwhile, Sens. Joseph Biden (D-Del.),
Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) and Chris Dodd (D-Conn.), former Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) and New Mexico Gov. Bill
Richardson (D) all rated very highly, according to Schaitberger. Though Schaitberger said details of the survey results
are confidential and used only for internal purposes, he did say that Obama was thought to be "less on-point on our
issues," and that McCain lacked the "passion" the union members expected. Schaitberger, in an interview with The Hill,
said Obama came across as too "somber," and "just didn't fire them up." The Hill: Sens. McCain and Obama fail with

"RUDY VS. POPE": Pope Benedict condemned politicians - like Rudy Giuliani - who support abortion rights and said
yesterday they should be excommunicated from the church. Giuliani, who took on the Vatican over abortion when he was
mayor, declined to fire back yesterday. "First of all, I do not get into debates with the Pope," a smiling Giuliani
told reporters in Huntsville, Ala. "That is not a good idea, and not just because I am a Catholic." But on a more
serious note, the pro-choice Republican said if elected President, he won't be taking his cues from the Pope and will
defy Benedict and other Catholic prelates who demand pro-choice Catholic pols be denied Communion. New York Daily News:

RUDY EARNED "EYE-POPPING" $11 MILLION: Republican 2008 hopeful Rudy Giuliani snared more than $11 million for his paid
speeches last year - an eye-popping figure that outpaced former President Bill Clinton's earnings, The Post has
learned. Giuliani's $11.4 million haul will be listed on the personal financial-disclosure forms he'll file next week,
according to sources. By contrast, Clinton - another in-demand speaker - earned close to $10 million for speeches last
year, a figure that will be on the disclosure forms for his wife, Democratic front-runner Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton,
the sources said. The former mayor's $100,000-a- pop speech earnings are on top of what he's made from his company,
