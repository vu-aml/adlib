Not sure all of you need this, but here is the newest info on OCP approval.  If you have any vendors not on the original or supplemental list, please fill out the grid and send to John.
Thanks,
Doug

As of this morning, Weil  informs that the court has not yet approved the order for theordinary course professionals, so even the original list of vendors that has been before the court for upwards of a month is not approved.   Weil says that the court might approve the order today, but we just have to wait and see. Once the court issues the order, the vendors still must complete a form of affidavit to submit to the court to complete the process. We have not yet been given the form of affidavit.

I attach the following:

1.  original list of vendors that is before the court for approval (doc "58#s02!.doc")

2. the current supplement list of proposed vendors, which has not been submitted to the court so far as I know, but which has been approved by the internal bankruptcy management committee for submission to the court (doc "supplement matrix 020702 marked.doc")

3. a grid for you to complete and send back to to me if you want to get additional law firms or other professionals (engineers, accountants, appraisers, other professional persons) approved, or if you want to send additional assignments to an OCP on the existing lists, as the OCP's apparently get approved for specific limited scopes. The criteria so far on for OCP's, subject to whatever the aproved order will say, is that the OCP is limited to a monthly budgte of $50k over an average of 6 months, and no more than $500k per case.  If you  think your budget will exceed that, then we need to talk. Depending on what Weil says, I would think the work should either be given to an existing specially retained profession or, if they can't handle the job due to expertise issues, perhaps another specially retained professional filing will nbeed to ne made. 

In addition to filing out the grid, the bankruptcy management committee will require that you be able to state thenew OCP you propose is not a related party (Enron and affilaited persons/parties do not have ecomonic interests in the proposed OCP, and vice versa). You should do that in your e-mail transmitting the completed grid back to me. (doc "OCP supplement addition grid.doc")
