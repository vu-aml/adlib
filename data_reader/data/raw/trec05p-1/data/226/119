    YOU CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE

At around 5 a.m., helicopters circled our village. Later, four men wearin=
g
Sudanese military uniforms who had arrived on camels, horses and by cars
entered our house and took some of our properties, then set the house on
fire. I was forced to flee with my four children to a nearby bush. My hus=
band
had fled first for fear that he might be killed. Some of the men who were=

caught unawares were chained together and burnt alive in a marketplace.
Of the 300 families from my village, about 25 people were killed and abou=
t
15 wounded. My sister, in her bid to run away from the attackers was shot=

and killed, along with her 3-year-old daughter.

In an attempt to escape the ordeal, we were captured and taken away by th=
e
attackers in khaki and in civilians? clothes, along with dozens of other
girls, and had to walk for eight hours. During the day, we were beaten up=

and were taken to a place in the bush and raped several times. For three
days, we did not receive food and almost no water. After five days, our
attackers had to move to another place and set us free. With no place to
call our home we moved into a refugee camp in Farchana, Chad, supported
by the United Nations.

Since early 2003, tens of thousands of Sudanese citizens who live in the
Darfur region have been systematically killed, raped, and displaced as th=
eir
villages have been destroyed. Through coordinated land and air attacks;
the burning of homes and crops; the rounding up of livestock; the destruc=
tion
of wells, granaries, and irrigation works; the uprooting of trees; and th=
e
theft of all possessions, the government of Sudan and the government-supp=
orted
Arab militia, Janjaweed, have displaced more than 1 million people.

The United Nations and other humanitarian agencies have been trying to su=
pport
us in their various capacities but this has not been enough. To give assi=
stance
to these bodies, we have formed an organization of Darfur Displaced Women=

Association (Association De Femmes D=E9plac=E9e Par Darfur). Our finances=
 come
from individuals who have human feelings and are sympathetic to our pligh=
t.
Our children need education, rehabilitation, food and clothing. Your cont=
ribution,
no matter how little, can make the difference.
