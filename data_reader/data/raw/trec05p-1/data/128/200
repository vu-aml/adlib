Hi,

The new grandbaby Samantha, her mother and father are doing fine. She is on her way home this afternoon if the pediatrician believes that she is ready to be released.

Regarding Jim's resignation, I agree that we should not be pressured into putting anyone on the board that will not assist us in moving forward and handling the complex issues that the board faces this year. Jim indicated that he would wait to resign for as long as he could or until we find a replacement. We can discuss this further tonight. I'm available anytime after 6:30 pm. We could either get together or all go out to dinner at Hungrey's or where ever if that works. Since the candidates to replace Jew Don Bony are coming to the Spires tomorrow night, I would like to attend that meeting if everyone is agreeable.

Let me know what works for this evening with everyone.
Paula
