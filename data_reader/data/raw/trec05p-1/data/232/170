Shemin Proctor (an outside lawyer who is helping with gas contracts) will be looking in to this.  Sarah Bruck (Enron Legal Specialist) may have some documentation questions.  
 
Thanks,
 
Kay

Kay - Thanks for your attention and assistance in this matter. 

Several  gas producers are flowing gas through Dominion Transmission pipeline to Enron's pool.  They have terminated their contracts with Enron, or have sent documents to us to terminate their contracts with Enron. They are calling now requesting letters confirming termination of their contracts and/or letters releasing their gas on Dominion Transmission's pipe from Enron's pool in order to satisfy Dominion Transmission's requirement for proof of termination and/or release of gas back to the producers.  Dominion Transmission is holding these producers' gas and is not letting the producers sell their gas to other buyers.


I have been trying for the last three weeks to discover the route these requests need to pass through in order to get the aforementioned termination and release notices. I have met with little success and fewer answers. Prior to my being involved, Nelson Ferries had forwarded a few requests through Contracts and Legal and had Fred Lagrasta sign off on them.  I also talked to several people last week in Contracts and Legal asking for help, but a process does not seem to be in place.

Please advise as to how quickly we can act on these requests.  Producers are fearful of not being able to sell their January 2002 gas (ie. not getting paid) and are facing severe financial hardships.  Please advise as to what I can provide or help out with this process.

A list of producers is provided below.  I am sure more producers will call. 

Thanks  WRP
