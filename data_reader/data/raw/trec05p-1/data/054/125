Good Evening Committee Members:

Just to keep you apprised, we have planned for a special discussion of the
second extraordinary legislative session with Dr. Barbara Barkovich and
Derek Naten at tomorrow's committee meeting.  As noted before, we are hoping
to hear from Kip Lipper in Senator Sher's office at our October 17 Committee
Meeting.  We will keep you updated in this regard.

*Please note, our October 3 meeting has been cancelled.  The SVMG Annual
Planning Conference will be held this year on October 2 and 3 in Half Moon
Bay.  Our Energy Director and Committee Chairs will be participating in this
conference.  Thanks.
