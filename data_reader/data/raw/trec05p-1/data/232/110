My  Dear,

In a brief  I am Mrs Jane Mupesa,wife to Ndoga Mupesa of Chiweshe ward in Muzarabani, Mashonaland Central province, who was allegedly killed in cold blood on 5th April 2001 by alleged Zanu PF militias and war veterans for supporting the (Mr Morgan Tsvangirai) Movement for Democratic Change, an opposition party to the tyranny government of President Robert Mugabe.I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration; I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country. 

As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there and many out rightly blackmail us. When my husband was alive I used to move funds running into millions of United States Dollars to Brazil/Lebanon and other Arab Countries. 

However, on the eve of my husband's death on 5th April 2001, he gave me the sum of US$39m(million) in cash to move to Lebanon ,but immediately my husband died I moved the funds to a  Security Firm through a diplomatic courier service where the fund is right now.


The funds have been in the Finance Firm since 2001.Because of the restriction placed on my family by the Zimbabwean Government, I Simply cannot travel to secure the funds from the Security Firm where this said amount was deposited, all you need to do is to furnish me with the requested information's bellow immediately;

1. Full names 
2. Contact address 
3. Telephone and fax numbers 
4. Location 

Please contact me immediately so that I will give you the contact of my Lawyer for more details and to expedite action. 
Alternative E-Mail address:mrs_janemupesafamily2001@caramail.com

Mrs Jane Mupesa
Muzaraban-Zimbabwe
