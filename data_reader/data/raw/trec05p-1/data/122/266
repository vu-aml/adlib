David,

This is to confirm that you have requested that the oil proceeds we received be used to make gas deliveries in the following months as follows:


April		$300,000

May		$400,000

June		$500,000

July		$800,000

While the above numbers are in dollars, we are currently calculating the price for each of these months that will result in the volume to be delivered at a fixed price.

If this information is correct, please confirm immediately by e-mail so that we can complete this transaction by 10:00 a.m. today as you requested.
