accumulated deficit since its inception, a negative
net worth, defau|t on |oans,and an auditors going
concern opinion. The company is going to need
financing. If that financing does not occur,the
company may not be able to complete some proposed
transactions and the company may not be able to
continue as a going concern in which case you could
|ose your entire investment. Other risks and
uncertainties inc|ude, but are not |imited to, the
ability of the Company to complete its business
p|an,reliance on key personnel, market conditions, the
