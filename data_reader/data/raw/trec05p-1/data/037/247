Could you please give the Transwestern Business Unit Coordinator some advice on when this audit will be resolved and what you think the best estimate is on the amount of compressor fuel tax  (PPI) that have to expense.

Thanks

So, I can't tell what my exposure is here.  Which line do I use?
The maximum shown on the schedule is $1.1MM   (expand column width on Column A).   Although it looks from the spreadsheet as if $300 to $600K may be more realistic for the compressor fuel tax through 4/01.  However, there could be $11K/month going forward. 
The other issue would be the sales tax on our purchase of personal property from NWP.  Whatever that may turn out to be, it should not be an earnings concern, but would be capitalized as part of the plant.  
If you need more specificity, I suggest you give Dan a call.

I'm sure Jerry is aware of this.  He isn't Dan's boss, but they're in the same CC and only a couple of cubes away in the Jefferson bldg.   
I don't think we have any reserves/accruals for these on the TW balance sheet.

Has Jerry Moore from the tax group been involved in this?  Do I have anything on the balance sheet for this?

John, I have prepared a more formal position regarding the exemption of "Compressor Fuel" consumed in a "continuing business activity" (Gas services).  Before I submit this position to you, I will circulate my position letter within the company and validate the facts.  
I will be relying primarily on Colorado Regulations 26-102.21 or 39-26-104.1(d.1).  Have these regulations changed recently?  My service may be out of date.
Attached below are schedules for Compressor and Domestic fuel consumption for the audit period.

Dan,
Here is my initial response.  I haven't had time to do too much research on
this, but this preliminarily the Department's position.  Sorry this took so
long  but I am working on a bankruptcy case which has my first priority.  jp

If the operating agreement constituted the entirety of the writing
accompanying the transfer of cash from Enron to Northwest Pipeline Corp., I
might agree.  But, the purchase agreement lists assets acquired for cash.

I don't believe that the statute and regulation support that position.
Transporting gas would have to qualify as providing gas or electric service
to qualify for the exemption.  I don't believe it does.  I definitely need
more research on this.

> PENALTY & INTEREST

The disposition of penalty and interest will be resolved at a level above the auditor level.
