                                           Brian with the Bloomfield Team called to let us know that when the flow gets to fluctuating up and down we are starting to fight for the gas against TransColorado,and El Paso.   (El Paso usually has the lowest pressure )   whoever has the lowest pressure at the time gets the gas. Then the control valve starts to fluctuate up and down trying to control.  Usually it will settle out if you lower the setpt. 2-3 mil.  IF you have any  QUESTIONS talk to BLACKIE FOUTZ w/ Bloomfield Team.
