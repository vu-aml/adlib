Krishna,
Could you see that I am granted access to Sitara development, reports selection?
I will be testing the new report myself. This is fairly high priority.

Thanks,

Krishna,

I am looking to create a new report based on an existing sitara report that generates a deal list by pub code to estimate
various indexes during bid week. This was first made for Anne Bike, West Desk risk group.

The purpose of this new report is to generate a list of Desk-To-Desk deals for a given period and desk and generate a WACOG.
The parameters for this new query include:

From and To Dates
Gas location (including All)
Desk (including All)

It should return to and from dates, volume, price, location, sitara number, tagg number, eol number (if any), and desk
It should generate subtotal volumes and WACOG for each desk, and each pipe location in each desk

Desks include: ENA - IM WSOCAL, ENA - IM WSJ, ENA - IM WKEYSTONE, ENA - IM WPGE, ENA - IM WROCKIES

If possible, the data should export into excel.

Thanks,
Jason Wolfe
Trading Analyst, West Desk
