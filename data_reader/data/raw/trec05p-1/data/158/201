Barry, what did you do to the company!?  Listen, sorry to hear about the 
problems at ENRON.  What a strange turn of events.  It is pretty bizarre 
after 10 years of ENRON being the model for other companies on how to 
succeed in the energy industry. What's your take on why it happened?  We get 
a little bit of news down here but we're a little out of touch.

How are you taking it?  Are you pissed? Do you feel like you squeezed pretty 
much what you wanted out of the job? What's the next thing for Barry Tic?  
Well, like all of life's curve-balls there is always something sweet in the 
next pitch you get (jeez, how sappy is that!).  Anyway, hope you're taking 
it all with the good nature you always do.

Hey, maybe this will give you the chance to take a holiday in Ecuador 
(Christmas turkey at our house this year?).  Say hi to Kim for us, drop me a 
line as soon as you can (a better address to reach me is craigh@ph.com.ec).  
Sorry I haven't sent a note before this but you know we are always rooting 
for you.

Your pal, Craig.
