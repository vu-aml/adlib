Attached is the first draft of the 6th floor plan.  If you are fundamentally in agreement with the locations of these groups, we'll ask department leads to put final names on seats.  

 


The 5th floor would accomodate IT, Accounting and Energy Op's (excluding logistics/scheduling).

Phase one will include moving estate people off the floors - best case Tues/Weds pm.
Phase two will include moving the people already on these floors to new locations - best case Weds/Thurs.
Phase three will include moving people from the Enron North building over - best case to be determined. 

Regards,
Tammy
