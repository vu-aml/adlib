NFL Reports, Player Updates

Latest NFL Player News

Amos Zereoue <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Zereoue is listed as questionable this week because of a sore shoulder. He might start at RB if healthy. He replaced Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala and gained 73 yards Sunday. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/19/01
The Pittsburgh Steelers may be without Bettis for at least one more week. Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to play Sunday against Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as d! ou! btful with a groin injury. "But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis) will come back and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's playing in the right games." Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His health status makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will likely start for Bettis.

Skip Hicks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=12436&>, RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Titans Head Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that he plans to give Hicks more work over the final three games of the season, according to the Nashville Tennessean . "We're going to play Skip more," Fisher said. "We're going to play Skip, if at all possible, as much as he played [Sunday] night … But I also want to get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This development will limit George's production over the final three weeks, making him a risky start.

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
McNair will miss Tuesday's practice due to tightness in his lower back which hampered him during Sunday's game against Green Bay. The injury is unrelated to his 1999 surgery to repair a disc in his lower back, and he should return to practice on Wednesday. Provided McNair heals over the next couple of days, he's a safe start for Week 15.

Amos Zereoue <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?scrip! t! =players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Zereoue re-injured his sprained shoulder late in Sunday's game against Baltimore. His status for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear, but he's only a marginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.

Gus Frerotte <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1070&>, QB DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on injured reserve due to a separated shoulder which might require surgery. Brian Griese will probably start for the remainder of the season, with Jarious Jackson serving as his backup.

James Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Hunter Updated 12/18/01
According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Jackson could miss the remainder of the season due to a sprained ankle. He wasn't a reliable weekly starter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay and Jamel White, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time the rest of the way if Jackson is out.

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Frank Updated 12/18/01
Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimor! e.! Don't reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based on the Ravens' strong rush defense.

Scott Mitchell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1025&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Mitchell could get the start Sunday against Baltimore due to Jon Kitna's strained ligament in the middle finger of his throwing hand. Whether Mitchell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect either QB to be worth starting in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season.

Akili Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=133415&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
The Bengals placed Smith on injured reserve with a hamstring injury Tuesday, officially ending his season. He will likely need surgery to reattach the muscle group in his hamstring to the bone. Jon Kitna will probably start in his place the rest of the season if he's healthy, but we don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the rest of the year anyway.

Terry Allen <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/18/01
The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnati after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10 carries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three after he recovered from a hand injury. None of the three is a worthy starter in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.! 
Doug Flutie <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 12/18/01
Chargers Head Coach Mike Riley said Monday that he plans to start Flutie Sunday against Kansas City instead of rookie Drew Brees. While Brees is not expected to play, he may see some playing time in the Week 16 finale against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player during the Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility he could sit in favor of Brees at any time.

Priest Holmes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1645&>, RB KC - Russell Updated 12/18/01
Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibly Thursday due to a sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable for Sunday's game against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his status before you consider using him this week.

Bubba Franks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Franks suffered ankle and tailbone injuries on Sunday. His current status is day to day. 

Curtis Conway <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 12/17/01
Conway injured his shin on Saturday against Oakland. His current status is day to day.! 
Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 12/17/01
George was outplayed by Skip Hicks this week, but head coach Jeff Fisher has indicated there is no RB controversy. Hicks will continue to see some carries at George's expense, though. 

Elvis Joseph <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=236843&>, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Joseph suffered a bruised shoulder on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/17/01
Gadsden suffered a strained hamstring on Sunday. His current status is day to day. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/17/01
Thrash bruised his ribs on Sunday. He is not expected to miss any playing time. 

Todd Pinkston <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Hunter Updated 12/17/01
Pinkston has no breaks in his clavicle. He is not expected to miss any playing time. 

Chad Lewis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&! ra! ndom=3213&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Lewis injured his groin on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Watters will undergo an MRI on his sprained ankle. The injury is not believed to be serious enough to keep him out of action on Dec. 23. 

Donovan McNabb <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 12/17/01
McNabb injured his wrist on Sunday. He should be able to play in Week 15.

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Bouman's injured right thumb will be re-examined on Monday. His status for the upcoming game against Jacksonville is uncertain. 

Jeff Garcia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 12/17/01
X-rays on Garcia's ribs following Sunday's game revealed no damage. He is expected to start on Saturday. 

Gus Frerotte <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1070&>, QB DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01Frerotte is expected to miss the rest of the season with a separated shoulder. Jarious Jackson will likely back up Brian Griese for the rest of the year. 

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Frank Updated 12/17/01
Dillon suffered a finger injury on Sunday. He is listed as probable for Week 15.

Akili Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=133415&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Smith will definitely sit out Cincinnati's Week 15 game. He injured his hamstring against the Jets Sunday and might miss the rest of the season.
Peerless Price <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Price injured his right ankle on Sunday. He will be evaluated on Monday. 

Travis Henry <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=235216&>, RB BUF - Martin Updated 12/17/01
The Buffalo News says Henry will undergo X-rays to determine the severity of his injured right knee. "It's pretty sore right now, so I'm not sure what's going to happen," Henry said. "It's a part of football. It was an awkward play. I got caught in the turf and the knee just went. Hopefully, it's not too serious."
