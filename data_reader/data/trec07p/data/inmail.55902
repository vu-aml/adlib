<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial"><b>World Energy Solutions' Hydrogen/Oxygen Enhanced Automobile Demonstrates a 24 Percent Reduction in Fuel Consumption</b></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 9pt;" face="Arial"><b>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., June 11, 2007  -- World Energy Solutions, Inc. (OTC BB:WEGY), a company focused on energy conservation technologies and environmental sustainability, is pleased to report that the company's test automobile experienced a 24% fuel flow reduction on its first run.</b><br>
<br>
After initializing the company's proprietary hydrogen/oxygen system, a 1998 Honda traveling at 60 MPH dropped its fuel flow from 2.1 GPH to 1.6 GPH. World Energy Solutions' hydrogen/oxygen powered internal combustion engine, commonly referred to as HHO, was successful in reducing the amount of gasoline required to drive the car by methodically introducing Hydrogen and Oxygen into the fuel system to augment the gasoline. To achieve these impressive results the company has also designed and developed a proprietary alternator that produces 3 phase power. That power system drives the company's unique onboard electrolysis system.<br>
<br>
World Energy Solutions has been actively developing energy and fuel savings systems based upon its rights to the patents application, ``Method and Apparatus for the Production of Hydrogen and Oxygen'' (Patent Application # 20070089997). These patent application rights were originally acquired to further develop an energy efficient and economical system that can produce hot water on demand. This same energy saving technology has been applied to the company's test automobile, creating onboard hydrogen/oxygen gas on the fly.<br>
<b><br>
``We firmly believe these initial results are the beginning of an entirely new energy/fuel saving technology. Not only do these new technologies offer the promise of reduced fuel consumption, but they also represent a potentially major reduction in harmful emissions,'' says Ben Croxton, CEO of World Energy Solutions, Inc. ``This is an exciting year for our company, as much of our developmental efforts begin to demonstrate their commercial merits.''</b><br>
<br>
The unique feature of the hydrogen/oxygen-powered internal combustion engine is the reduced amount of gasoline required as the primary fuel source. HHO is environmentally friendly since, through continuous electrolysis, the gasoline is replaced with water and the constituent gases are removed. Through its gasoline substitution and removal of exhaust gases, the technology of HHO addresses the rising costs of fuel and the heightened need for environmental responsibility.</font></p>

WES sets a precedent for companies that bring new energy-efficient products and systems to the mass manufacturer market. WES is unique in the industry in that it takes inventions and concepts for conversion to commercial readiness and pre-production prototypes. This approach is expressed in our mission statement and expanded upon in the WES Business Model. There is a heightened global concern about the need to conserve energy and use power efficient products and systems. Recognizing this, the business community is increasingly supportive of initiatives directed at energy efficiency. Government is also supportive. The United States Congress is proposing legislation, backed by financial inducements, to encourage industrial and domestic acquisition of, and conversion to, energy efficient and power saving equipment and systems.<br>

<td bgcolor="#222020"><font style="font-size: 9pt;" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">In addition to significant energy savings offered by 'Pure Air Technology', the system ‘sterilizes’ the passing of air through the cleansing unit by removing all bio-organisms and chemical agents. No other system can remove both biological and chemical agents from the air. The cost of the air sterilization is, therefore, significantly lower than previously used methods.<br>
<br>
WES owns a novel system that will not only purify the air of microorganisms but also rid indoor environments of chemical contaminants. In recent years, comparative risk studies performed by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have consistently ranked indoor air pollution among the top five environmental risks to people’s health. EPA studies of human exposure indicate that the levels for many pollutants may be 2-5 times higher indoors than outdoors. The University of Florida’s novel system will improve the quality of life for millions of asthma- and allergy-sufferers and will also deliver effective protection against bioterrorism by completely clearing the air of all microorganisms and chemical contaminants.<br>
<br>
“We are very excited about adding Dr. Mazyck and his team to the research and development capability of World Energy Solutions” Said Ben Croxton, CEO of World Energy Solutions, Inc. “Working in conjunction with Dr. Mazyck and the University of Florida allows us to substantially speed up commercial exploitation of the Pure Air Technology system for which we acquired the worldwide rights and patent application from the University of Florida, Dr. Mazyck and the UF team last year. We expect to deliver the most State of the Art air purification system for homes, commercial, industrial, government and military markets in very short order” Croxton says.<br>
<br>
“There are a variety of indoor air purification technologies commercially available, but none of them adequately address the removal of disease causing bacteria and potentially harmful organic compounds. The coupling of the WES team, Pure Air Technology, and WES commitment to energy savings technologies offers an exciting solution that should substantially improve upon the current state-of-the-art" says Dr. Mazyck.</font></td>

<br>
In November 2005, WES acquired patent application # 11254593 from Robert Depalo, RJD Technologies, Inc., to develop a Hydrogen-Oxygen production system to create inexpensive hot water. The patent application directly relates to the more cost effective process for the production of Hydrogen and Oxygen.<br>
