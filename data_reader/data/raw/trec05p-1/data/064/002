Tamara:

Eric Saibi has been linked to Enron Power Marketing Inc.  His global ID is:  95063.  GCP does not provide passwords for EOL, the EOL group handles passwords.

Doug:

Per our conversation, we will await to hear from you the specific desk to which you would like Eric linked next week.  There are currently 16 different "ERCOT" desks, therefore we need to narrow down to the specific desk.  Feel free to call w/ questions.  Thanks.
