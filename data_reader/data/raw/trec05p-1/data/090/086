U.S. ASKS SUPREME COURT
TO REVIEW NextWave DECISION

As negotiations continued to settle the dispute surrounding
NextWave Telecom, Inc., the federal government today asked the U.S.
Supreme Court to review a lower court ruling that the FCC illegally
reclaimed the carrier's "C" and "F" block PCS (personal communica-
tions service) licenses.

The U.S. Solicitor General's Office filed a petition for a writ of
certiorari with the Supreme Court.  Today was the deadline for the
filing, which sources said was designed to preserve the FCC's
options in the case.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington ruled
in June that the FCC illegally reclaimed NextWave's licenses while
the company was under the protection of a bankruptcy court (TR,
June 25).

Meanwhile, several wireless carriers that bid on NextWave's
spectrum at an auction earlier this year appeared to be nearing an
agreement with NextWave and the FCC that could settle the 5-year-
old dispute.  The Office of Management and Budget also is
participating in the negotiations.  Under the agreement, NextWave
would net about $5 billion and the U.S. Treasury would get about
$11 billion, according to sources.

In another development, NextWave said it would seek a continuance
of an Oct. 22 hearing before the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of New York (White Plains).  NextWave wants the
hearing rescheduled for Nov. 1.  It would be the third such delay
of the hearing.  At the hearing, the court will consider the ade-
quacy of NextWave's disclosure statement accompanying its
bankruptcy reorganization plan and whether to approve NextWave's
technology cooperation and subscription agreements with QUALCOMM,
Inc.

Also, in a filing with the bankruptcy court, the FCC this week
asked NextWave to turn over numerous documents and information
related to its reorganization, including information on its
investors, business partners, and business agreements, as well as
cash flow, revenue, income, costs, and subscribership forecasts. 
The Commission also wants documents that support NextWave's asser-
tions that its business plan as a "carrier's carrier," selling
services on a wholesale basis to other providers, would be
successful.

MISSOURI PSC SUSPENDS SW BELL's LONG DISTANCE TARIFFS

The Missouri Public Service Commission has suspended two tariffs
filed by subsidiaries of Southwestern Bell Communications Services,
Inc., until Feb. 17, 2002.  At a prehearing conference today, the
commission said it would review the tariffs, which were part of the
subsidiaries' applications for certificates to offer long distance
service.  Southwestern Bell Long Distance and SBC Long Distance
applied for the certificates.

The commission's tariff suspension could delay SW Bell's entry into
the long distance market.  The FCC has until Nov. 18 to approve or
reject SW Bell's application to provide in-region interLATA (local
access and transport area) service under section 271 of the federal
Telecommunications Act of 1996.

AT&T Communications of the Southwest, Inc., said the rates in the
subsidiaries' proposed tariffs were predatory.  If the subsidiaries
were required to pay SW Bell's switched access charges, their rates
would be priced below cost, AT&T said.  SW Bell characterized
AT&T's predatory pricing claims as further attempts to delay SW
Bell's entry in the long distance market.

DESPITE LAPSE OF `NET TAX BAN,
STATES NOT EXPECTED TO RUSH TO TAX

Congress may have recessed this week without agreeing to extend the
moratorium on Internet taxation before its Oct. 21 expiration date,
but a National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL) aide told
TRDaily not to expect any immediate movement at the state or local
levels to impose e-commerce or Internet access taxes.

That's because only a "handful" of state legislatures are currently
in session, and none of them are currently considering bills that
would defy the moratorium, the NCSL staffer said.  There's also a
"misconception" that the legislatures would be the only govern-
mental bodies to approve measures to tax Internet access, the aide
said.  Instead, he explained, such change could come from state tax
departments that interpret their current tax laws as applying to
the Internet.

The House on Oct. 16 did approve a bill (HR 1522) to extend the
current moratorium until Nov. 1, 2003, but a push to take up
similar legislation in the Senate was blocked late last night. 
Both chambers are expected to return from their brief recesses on
Tuesday, Oct. 23.

QWEST BOOSTS STAKE IN KPNQwest, LEANS AGAINST
EXERCISING OPTION TO BECOME MAJORITY OWNER

Qwest Communications International, Inc., has "no current
intention" to acquire a majority stake in its European joint
venture, even though it will receive an option to do so, said
Joseph Nacchio, Qwest's chairman and chief executive officer.

Qwest said late yesterday it would boost its voting stake in
KPNQwest NV from 44.3% to 47.5% by paying $64.1 million for 14
million shares.  Qwest's principal shareholder, Anschutz Co., will
buy six million shares.  In a related transaction, KPNQwest said it
would buy Global TeleSystems, Inc. (GTS).

Qwest has an option to boost its stake in KPNQwest by acquiring
some or all of the remaining shares held by its European partner,
Dutch carrier KPN NV.  But Mr. Nacchio suggested Qwest was leaning
against exercising that option.  Rather than invest more in Europe,
Qwest has many domestic uses for its cash, he said.

In addition, its new investment in KPNQwest will give it adequate
influence over the venture without requiring that the venture's
finances be consolidated with Qwest's -- as would be the case if
Qwest had majority control, he said.

"I don't know the reason to step up any more than we have," he told
analysts during a conference call.  Qwest may assign its option to
other potential partners with whom it has held discussions, he
added.

Its new investment in the joint venture will "move KPNQwest to the
position in Europe that we'd always envisioned, which is kind of a
mirror image of Qwest on the far side of the Atlantic," he said. 
"It's going to eliminate a complicated structure that was useful
when we set up the joint venture but no longer was providing the
kind of governance we thought the venture needed."

Rather than equal representation from each partner, the new
KPNQwest board will have three directors from Qwest, one from KPN,
and two independent members.  While Qwest will retain "special
rights" to approve "certain strategic decisions," KPN will lose its
equivalent rights.

The transaction, which the companies expect to close by year-end,
will help KPN in its effort to reduce debt by $4.5 billion by year-
end (TRDaily, Sept. 7).  KPN now will be allowed to sell large
blocks of KPNQwest shares as early as 2003, a year earlier than
permitted under a previous agreement.

For KPNQwest, the transaction will clarify its governance and
enable it to respond more quickly to market conditions, Mr. Nacchio
said.  The related transaction to acquire GTS, a London-based
carrier, means that KPNQwest will change its focus from building
networks to deploying service, said Jack McMaster, KPNQwest's
president and CEO.

The GTS assets will deepen KPNQwest's network presence throughout
Europe, will add 48,000 accounts to KPNQwest's customer base, and
will double its Web-hosting sites, Mr. McMaster said.  The $580
million acquisition will be accomplished through a prepackaged
bankruptcy filing in the U.S. and the Netherlands.

KPNQwest will issue $190 million in convertible notes to GTS
bondholders in exchange for GTS bonds and convertible securities
with a face value of $1.7 billion.  KPNQwest will assume GTS's $190
million credit facility and $225 million in capital leases.  A bank
syndicate has agreed to provide the combined company with a credit
facility of $450 million.

A majority of bondholders have consented to the exchange, GTS said. 
The transaction will require approval from bankruptcy courts in the
U.S. and the Netherlands, European regulators, and KPNQwest
shareholders.  Closing is expected in March 2002.

"This transaction represents the completion of the consensual
restructuring process that we began late last year," said Robert
Amman, GTS's chairman and CEO.  "We greatly regret that no value
can accrue to our preferred and common shareholders."

Mr. Nacchio said KPNQwest and GTS together would be able to take
advantage of the hole left in the global marketplace by the failure
of Concert, the global joint venture of AT&T Corp. and British
Telecommunications plc (TRDaily, Oct. 16).

"There's a greater void to serve multinational accounts,
particularly in the theaters of North America and Europe," he said. 
"I think it's ironic that in the same industry, two of the old
traditional market leaders dissolved a venture to accomplish
exactly what we're stepping up to do.  Time will tell who's right."

NOKIA, SCIENTIFIC-ATLANTA BUCK TREND,
MANAGE TO POST PROFITS IN THIRD QUARTER

With much of the telecom equipment sector still awash in red ink,
Nokia Corp. and Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., bucked the trend by
reporting solid, but reduced, levels of profitability. 

Helsinki-based Nokia today posted third quarter revenues of $6.33
billion, off 7% from year-ago figures.  Profits came in at $683
million, down 18% from last year.  Driving revenue growth during
the third quarter was the firm's mobile phone business, which
generated $4.73 billion of sales, off just 3% from the comparable
quarter last year.  Revenues from Nokia's network business tailed
off 14% to $1.49 billion. 

"Nokia, as a flexible, lean, and focused organization, has done
more than just weather the storm of the past several months," said
Jorma Ollila, chief executive officer.  "We succeeded in sustaining
solid profitability and high cumulative operating cash flow. . .in
an intensely competitive and volatile environment."

Moreover, Nokia pushed up estimates for the fourth quarter, fore-
casting that overall sales would increase as much as 20% above
third quarter levels due to renewed strength in mobile phone sales. 
The company expects a modest increase in earnings.

Scientific-Atlanta, a maker of cable TV set-top boxes and other
broadband delivery gear, late yesterday reported $410.1 million of
revenues for its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 28, a whopping
31% less than year-ago figures.  Helped by cost-cutting efforts,
the firm still managed to push out a $37.1 million quarterly profit
from operations versus $63.8 million for the same quarter last
year.

"Booking activity was slower in the quarter due to the economy, and
following the events of Sept. 11, the company's normally back-end
loaded bookings did not materialize in the last few weeks of the
quarter," Scientific-Atlanta said.  Since the end of the quarter,
however, "the order take rate has been significantly higher than in
the first quarter," the firm said, adding it had received orders
for 700,000 digital set-top boxes thus far in the current quarter.

"In a very difficult quarter, we continue to be profitable," said
James McDonald, chief executive officer.  Regardless of top-line
activity, Scientific-Atlanta continues to whittle away at expenses. 
It announced plans to lay off 750 employees or about 10% of the
workforce.  Those cuts and others will strip $61 million out of the
firm's cost structure on an annual basis beginning in the fiscal
third quarter and lead to a $22 million charge in the second quar-
ter.

CUSHIONED BY EARLIER WARNINGS, ANALYSTS
GET WHAT THEY EXPECT FROM NORTEL, CORNING

Nortel Networks Corp. sees signs that spending by telecom service
providers is stabilizing, albeit at a level far below the heyday of
1999 and early 2000.  "We believe we are beginning to see early
indications that capital spending by service providers is
approaching sustainable levels," said Frank Dunn, the company's
incoming president and chief executive officer.  But he said it
remained "difficult to predict" where that level would be.

In releasing their third quarter financial results, Nortel and
Corning, Inc., showed symptoms of the same disease:  a slowdown in
demand for telecom equipment and data networking gear.  Both
companies in recent weeks have disclosed plans to reduce their
workforces, close facilities, and discontinue product lines to
bring their costs in line with lower revenue.  Both also warned
Wall Street to expect lower sales and earnings.

The companies' results for the quarter ending Sept. 30 were largely
in line with reduced expectations.  At Nortel, revenues from
continuing operations were $3.7 billion, a 45% drop from a year
ago.  The net loss was $2.2 billion versus a net gain of $597
million for the same period last year.

Corning posted third quarter sales of $1.5 billion, a 21% decline
from the year-ago figure.  Its net income was $85 million compared
with $317 million a year ago.

"This is a very different company in a very different and still
difficult environment," Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Thomas B. Astle
said of Nortel.  Nortel's stock "starts to look interesting" only
if there are signs that "the market is bottoming. . .and the
company's financial house is now in order," he said.  "However, we
think we are a little too early on both of these."

Regarding Corning, Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Fox said the
company's management "has as good a handle on its business as could
be expected given the volatile environment."

Nortel declined to offer predictions regarding its fourth quarter
performance.  Corning said it expected fourth quarter sales in the
range of $1 billion and a loss of $0.20-$0.25 per share.

slid to $84.6 million from $114.1 million in the year-ago quarter. 
Despite the top-line woes, Advanced Fiber posted net income of
$15.8 million for the most recent quarter, which included

quarter ended Sept. 30 were $41.3 million, down from $97.0 million
a year ago.  Net losses for the most recent quarter were $12.7

from a revenue standpoint," commented Dave Rickey, chief executive
officer.  Applied Micro makes integrated circuits for optical net-
works. 

Com21, Inc., a cable modem maker, posted third quarter revenues of
$30.1 million, down from $34.1 million in the second quarter of the
year and $60.6 million a year ago.  The net loss for the latest

quarter.

Covad Communications Group, Inc., a bankrupt DSL (digital sub-
scriber line) service provider, reported a net increase of 13,000
lines in service on its network for the third quarter.  Covad ended
the period with 346,000 lines in service.

Carrier Access Corp. generated third quarter revenues of $20.9
million accompanied by a net loss of $8.1 million.  In the same
quarter last year, the company posted revenues of $40.1 million
with a $4.0 million profit.  Carrier Access is a telecom equipment
manufacturer. 

Western Multiplex Corp., a maker of wireless network equipment,
posted revenues of $21.7 million for the third quarter, down from

Sycamore Networks, Inc., warned that revenues for its fiscal first
quarter ending Oct. 27 would decline to a range of $20 million to
$25 million.  It will record a pro forma net loss of up to $44 mil-
lion.  Restructuring efforts are expected to produce charges of up
to $210 million.  Those are related to excess inventory, layoffs of
240 employees, and asset write-downs.  "Without clear signs of a
turnaround in customer spending, Sycamore is taking action to
reduce expenses and resize the business for this new economic
environment," said Dan Smith, chief executive officer. 

Sunrise Telecom, Inc., said net sales for the third quarter fell by
nearly half to $17.9 million from $35.0 million in the year-ago
quarter.  For the most recent quarter, Sunrise squeaked out a
$90,000 profit versus $7.3 million of profit in last year's third
quarter.  Sunrise provides service verification equipment for tele-
com and Internet networks. 

Ulticom, Inc., which makes software for telecom service providers,
forecasted sales of $13 million to $14 million for its third

$9.2 million and a net loss of $11.3 million.  In the year-ago
quarter, Nuance generated $14.4 million of revenues and a $4.6
million net loss.  Nuance is a maker of speech recognition and
other voice-related telecom software.

was $7.0 million versus a small profit in the same quarter last
year.  Netro said it had begun to "witness the beginning of a
recovery within our customer base" early in the third quarter. 
"However, we remain concerned about the general economic
sluggishness, particularly following the tragic events of Sept.
11."
