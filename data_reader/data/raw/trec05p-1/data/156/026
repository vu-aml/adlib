As you are aware, the Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (Settlement) of the SLA and Carlton proceedings have now been filed.  In accordance with Article 11, Section B of the Settlement, a joint Northern-Customer Operational Team is now being formed to:  (1) define the details of a mutually agreeable imbalance resolution utilizing in-kind and cash-out options; and (2) define parameters for Northern's operational imbalance management.

This memo serves as an official request to the parties to nominate individuals to participate in the discussions of this Operational Team.  We would encourage parties to nominate participants who have commercial responsibilties or direct commercial experience in these areas.  Such commercial make-up of the team members will allow for meaningful discussion on the operational and commercial issues necessary to arrive at a timely and mutually acceptable resolution.

Please submit to Northern, the name, phone number, and e-mail address of the individual you would like to participate on this Operational Team.  This information should be sent to Steve Kirk at steve.kirk@enron.com no later than December 7, 2001.  An initial organizational meeting (via conference call) of all participants is planned for 9:00 AM central time on December 12, 2001.

A confirmation and agenda for this initial meeting will be sent to all participants prior to the call.

The members of this Operational Team for Northern will be Mike McGowan, Steve Kirk, Steve January, and Lynn Blair.

If you have any questions, please call Steve Kirk at (402) 398-7067 or Mike McGowan at (402) 398-7110.
