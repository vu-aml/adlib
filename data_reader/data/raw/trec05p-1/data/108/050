> National Grid is changing Internet Service Providers, and a change may be
> needed to your setup for downloading Massachusetts Electric Default
> Customer Lists.  If the changes described below are not made, you will
> find that you cannot log in to the National Grid FTP server,
> ftp.us.ngrid.com, after this weekend.
>
> The change is straightforward -- you initially received instructions to
> enter the hostname IP address 204.164.80.201 when you installed the FTP
> client (WS_FTP Pro) on your computer.  The change that needs to be made is
> to replace the IP address number with the text ftp.us.ngrid.com.
>
> To update your installation, please do the following:
> *	Start WS_FTP Pro on your computer
> *	When you see the initial directory screen with the WS_FTP sites
> listed, highlight the ftp.us.ngrid.com item with a single click (do not
> double click -- this will take you to the password entry instead of the
> Properties screen noted below)
> *	With the ftp.us.ngrid.com entry highlighted, click the "Properties"
> button on the right hand border of the dialog box
> *	On the "General" tab of the Properties screen, replace the entry in
> the "Host Name/Address" box with the text ftp.us.ngrid.com, (the same as
> the entry in the "Site Name" box)
> *	Click the "OK" button
>
> You should now be able to log in to the site with the current password,
> and future IP address changes by National Grid should not require any
> change to the WS_FTP Pro client setup.
