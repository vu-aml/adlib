Louise,

Thanks for the quick response.  I have considered the offer, and feel that a Director's position would not be of interest to me.

If something else comes up, do let me know.

Regards,
Sandeep.

I spoke to Rahil yesterday, my view with regard to Enron Americas si that we have plenty of Director positions in Origination but VP positions are rare.  Let me know if a Director position is of interest.
