Hello Jeff,

This would be a project that we, my guys and I would take on, not just a side job.  I propose we do the job on a T& M basis, which is essentially all I do anymore.

The following are my labor rates for my guys and myself, I don't do cash work as it leaves me and my employees vulnerable, should some accident occur.

J. Docker  $45.00/hr.
Paul $30.00/hr.
Dyton $30.00/hr.
Diaz $27.00/hr.

I tack 15% on top of labor and materials, when presenting an invoice. I request payment for ongoing projects on a bi-weekly basis or upon completion of the work.

If this meets with your approval, let me know so we can get together this weekend and go over your plan. As mentioned could probably start this project in about two weeks, and if its not to elaborate a plan could probably complete in about two weeks.

Home/office tel: 785-3929

Best Wishes,

Jim Docker
