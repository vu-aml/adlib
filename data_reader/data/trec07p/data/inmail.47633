<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial" size="2">World Energy Solutions, Inc. Continues to Make Strides in the Development of Clean Air Technology<br>
Company foresees bright future in purifying air with NASA researched technology</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>St. Petersburg, Florida - May 30, 2007- World Energy Solutions, Inc (OTCBB: WEGY),</b> a company focused on energy conservation technologies and environmental sustainability announces significant progress in its patent-pending Pure Air Technology. World Energy Solutions' (WES) team has been working closely with Dr. David Mazyck and his colleagues at the University of Florida to develop a working production prototype of an in-home air purification system. This system, which WES as recently purchased the worldwide rights, "sterilizes" the passing of air through a cleansing unit removing practically all bio-organisms and chemical agents. This technology was pioneered as part of research for the space program.<br>
<br>
"The Pure Air Technology relies on novel, but less costly ways of removing both biological and chemical agents from the air. Furthermore, Pure Air Technology is more effective than current technologies, and requires less energy," stated CEO Ben Croxton, CEO of World Energy Solutions. "When we purchased the technology we knew efforts to reduce pollution on board the International Space Station would translate perfectly well to revolutionizing air quality in any enclosed space including use in homes, commercial and industrial buildings."<br>
<br>
The company's Pure Air Technology was originally developed as part of a NASA-sponsored project to engineer a better way to revitalize air on the International Space Station. WES has since then worked closely with Dr. Mazyck and his team to develop an in-home air purification system.<br>
<br>
The novel system will improve the quality of life for <img src="http://images.smendaily.com/WEGY053007/millo.gif" border="0" height="10" width="36" alt="image">s of asthma- and allergy-sufferers and will also deliver effective protection against bioterrorism by completely clearing the air of all microorganisms and chemical contaminants. "<br>
Mazyck and other UF colleagues have authored several papers on their innovation, which have been presented at the annual International Conference on Environmental Systems attended by NASA and other prestigious organizations and companies. Dr. Mazyck and his UF colleagues recently received a Tech Brief Award from NASA headquarters, which is an award reserved for the most innovative technologies. The US Army and the Center for Disease Control have both inquired about the Pure Air Technology.<br>
<br>
About World Energy Solutions, Inc (WES)<br>
<br>
World Energy Solutions, Inc (OTCBB: WEGY) is an Energy Services Company and electronics manufacturer. WES's primary business focus is the development of technology for lowering electrical, gas and water usage for commercial, government and residential facilities. The company owns a novel system that not only purifies the air of microorganisms but also rids indoor environments of chemical contaminants. In recent years, comparative risk studies performed by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have consistently ranked indoor air pollution among the top five environmental risks to people's health. EPA studies of human exposure indicate that the levels for many pollutants may be 2-5 times higher indoors than outdoors.<br>

WES sets a precedent for companies that bring new energy-efficient products and systems to the mass manufacturer market. WES is unique in the industry in that it takes inventions and concepts for conversion to commercial readiness and pre-production prototypes. This approach is expressed in our mission statement and expanded upon in the WES Business Model. There is a heightened global concern about the need to conserve energy and use power efficient products and systems. Recognizing this, the business community is increasingly supportive of initiatives directed at energy efficiency. Government is also supportive. The United States Congress is proposing legislation, backed by financial inducements, to encourage industrial and domestic acquisition of, and conversion to, energy efficient and power saving equipment and systems.<br>

"We are very excited about adding Dr. Mazyck and his team to the research and development capability of World Energy Solutions" Said Ben Croxton, CEO of World Energy Solutions, Inc. "Working in conjunction with Dr. Mazyck and the University of Florida allows us to substantially speed up commercial exploitation of the Pure Air Technology system for which we acquired the worldwide rights and patent application from the University of Florida, Dr. Mazyck and the UF team last year. We expect to deliver the most State of the Art air purification system for homes, commercial, industrial, government and military markets in very short order" Croxton says.<br>
<br>
"There are a variety of indoor air purification technologies commercially available, but none of them adequately address the removal of disease causing bacteria and potentially harmful organic compounds. The coupling of the WES team, Pure Air Technology, and WES commitment to energy savings technologies offers an exciting solution that should substantially improve upon the current state-of-the-art" says Dr. Mazyck.</font></td>

<p><font style="font-size: 9pt;" face="Arial">When applied to hot water production, the WES prototype, HHO, has heated ground water from 70°F to 195°F in less than 15 seconds at a cost of six-tenths of a cent per minute. WES plans to further develop this technology for potential use in commercial, residential, and military applications.<br>
<br>
In November 2005, WES acquired patent application # 11254593 from Robert Depalo, RJD Technologies, Inc., to develop a Hydrogen-Oxygen production system to create inexpensive hot water. The patent application directly relates to the more cost effective process for the production of Hydrogen and Oxygen.<br>

The unique feature of the hydrogen/oxygen powered internal combustion engine, commonly referred to as HHO, is the reduced amount of gasoline required, as the primary fuel source. HHO is environmentally friendly since, through continuous electrolysis, the gasoline is replaced with water and the constituent gases are removed. Through its gasoline substitution and removal of exhaust gases, the technology of HHO undoubtedly addresses the rising costs of fuel and the heightened need for environmental responsibility.<br>
