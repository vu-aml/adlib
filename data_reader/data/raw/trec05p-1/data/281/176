Blessings to you.

I am the above named person but now undergoing medical treatment now. I a=
m
married to Dr. Waltner De Martinez who worked with Angolan embassy in Mex=
ico
for over nine years before he died in the year 2002.
We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief i=
llness
that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again
Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outs=
ide
my matrimonial home, which the Bible is against. When my late husband was=

alive he deposited the sum of$27.6Million (twenty-seven million six hundr=
ed
thousand U.S. Dollars) with one finance/security company in Europe.

Presently, this money is still with the Security Company. Recently, my Do=
ctor
told me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer pro=
blem.
Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I de=
cided
to donate this fund to church or better still a Christian individual that=

will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a
church or individual to that will use this to fund churches, orphanages a=
nd
widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of the lo=
rd
is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand t=
hat
gives. I took this decision because I don?t have any child that will inhe=
rit
this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want m=
y
husbands hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a s=
ituation
where this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for
taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I
am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord.

Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my=

peace. I don?t need any telephone communication in this regard because of=

my health, and because of the presence of my husband's relatives around m=
e
always. I don?t want them to know about this development. With God all th=
ings
are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contac=
t
of the Finance/Security Company Europe. I will also issue you a letter of=

authority that will empower you as the original- beneficiary of this fund=
.
I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my sh=
epherd.
My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that w=
ants
to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be pr=
ayerful
all through your life.

Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or Chr=
istian
individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act acco=
rdingly
as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you.
Please reply me through my private email; ruthanne4all1@yahoo.co.uk

Remain blessed
Mrs. Ruthanne Ruby Martinez
