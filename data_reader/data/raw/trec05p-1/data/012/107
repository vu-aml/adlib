Within a few days you should notice immediate erection size increases

90% of males were interested in improving their sexual stamina,
performance, and the size of their manhood. Are you one of the 90%?

You guys have made my dreams come true. I have been self-conscience for as
long as I can remember. I did not want to shower with other guys growing up,
because I was embarrassed. Not only has your system increased the size of my
manhood while erect, but it has helped my size while flaccid as well. I hang
bigger, and I feel more like the man I should have been all these years. The
change is tremendous, I wanted to send you this note to let you know what it
has done for me, and of course to order more LONGZ! Leroy, Brooklyn

Rob's first thought was to search the pockets of his captive, and to his
delight he found and recovered his box of food tablets
