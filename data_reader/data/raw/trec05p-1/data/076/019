Below is a summary of the events which have been occurring since last week's
meeting between the UDCs and ESPs re the implementation of the suspension of
direct access:

1. On October 3rd, a small working group comprised of representatives of the
three UDCs, Enron, Commonwealth and UC/CSU had a conference call to discuss
the filing of a joint proposal on the numerous issues surrounding the
implementation of the suspension of direct access.  While SCE was
represented on the call, it was clear that they were not interested in a
joint proposal and would file their own plan.  On the call, drafting
assignments were divvied up and another call was scheduled for Tuesday the
9th.

2.  On October 4h (as directed by the decision suspending DA), the UDCs
submitted letters to the Energy Division on their progress in implementing
the suspension.  PG&E and SDG&E submitted a joint letter which basically set
forth what they had done to date and their progress of working with the
ESPs.  They stated that they anticipated filing a joint proposal with the
ESPs soon.  SCE, however, was more specific in its submission.  Therein, SCE
states that "SCE will not accept connect DASRs after October 20, 2001." The
submittal also states that "SCE will not process connect DASRs for service
accounts which did not exist on September 20, 2001."

3. On October 9th, a conference call was held between SDG&E, PG&E, Enron,
Commonwealth, NewWest and UC/CSU.  At that time, SDG&E and PG&E informed the
ESPs that they would not be able to file a joint proposal.  That, instead,
they would be filing an advice letter (probably joint between the two UDCs)
which proposed a connect DASR cut off date. While a definitive date was not
stated, they indicated that it would be around the end of the year.

4. PG&E and SDG&E stated that they would file such advice letters by the end
of the week.  Parties would have approximately 10 days to respond.
