Kathy & Chris:

I just received the nomination from Brazos for the Ponderosa Pine plant. For Monday & Tuesday (4/8 & 4/9) they are estimating to run the plant at a level that will burn approximately 43,000 MMBtu/day.

If you have sold Monday's gas, don't change anything. I probably would not sell Tuesday's gas just for the sake of trying to stay on the good side of Lonestar.

Call me at (248) 813-1063 if there are any questions.

MM
