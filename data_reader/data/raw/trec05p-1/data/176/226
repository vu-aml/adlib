Hedda et al,

That is perfectly horrible.  In this neighborhood, it seems it is just a matter of time before a car is broken into if it is parked unsecured and especially if anything is visible inside the car.

EVERYONE - we are the only ones who can discourage this.  Any time you see someone who doesn't belong in the neighborhood wandering around aimlessly, call the police at the non-emergency number.  If they are not busy, they'll come "interview" these folks.  If they are under the influence of anything or not carrying id they can be jailed.  If the creeps get the message that if they walk though EMCA territory, they can be arrested, they may go elsewhere.  The cops seem happier to shake-down loiterers if there is a complainant involved rather than just cruising the neighborhood hassling folks. 

Happy and Safe Holidays,

BJS

  Neighbors, yesterday four cars were vandalized at Bomar St. The  glass windows were shatered. My cousin from Michigan was visiting me. The window behind the driver's seat was broken. The police was at Bomar and Grant with the same problem. I am sick and tired of this abuse. And yesterday I was also ashamed. It's not only the broken glass is all the secondary effects that this kind of incidents cause to the victim. And the perpetrators are probably laughing at all of us. Because for them is probably a joke. I am sorry of giving all of you this news in this beautiful day but we need to be aware. Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Hedda, 416 Bomar.
