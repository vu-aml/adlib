ETX was supposed to be Electronic Transaction.  An exchange is a regulated body - which we are not.
We should be careful not to use the word "exchange".  I know this sounds trivial - but it matters to legal.

Typo correction - ETX for Electronic Trading Exchange as the UBS name for EOL internal identifier, not EFX as my previous email.  Thanks Tom.

Subject: PLEASE REVIEW - PROGRESS REPORT from testing on Monday, Feb 4th & WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY TESTING SCHEDULE


Please review the progress report from Monday's regression test below.   It was a success, and the goals were accomplished!  Thank you for your participation!
All the issues should be resolved by now.  If you are aware of any open issues, please email me ASAP.
Invoices are being settled now, and we are starting the SAP testing for this afternoon.
 
We need your testing help (again), with the following tests below.  These are limited to ETX (the name formally known as EOL) entered deals only, but need to process to SAP.
Please review attached for those scheduled, and respond with any updates/ substitutions.
 
Wednesday 10:00am - 03:00pm
Test:  Mock-mock test - ETX deal entry only.
Purpose:  Perform a simulation of a 4 gas physical/ financial, 4 power physical/ financial transactions using (Reliant/ Duke/ Williams/ UBS Warburg Energy/ Enron Canada). 
Goals include:
    (1) Simulate processing ETX transactions before Thursday mock test
    (2) If the NT user id conversion goes through on 02/05 pm, use the new UBS Id's
    (3) Validate any systems changes from Monday/ Tuesday
 

User involvement:  See attached schedule.   Please review and respond if any changes are needed.
    Global data should be setup already given we will use existing counterparties/ addresses/ contracts.
 
The ETX deals will be entered by 10:30, and we need the participants to process these downstream.

54979 Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C.
64245 Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company
65268 Reliant Energy Services, Inc.
3015 Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.

Thursday 09:00am - 05:00pm
Test:  Mock ETX test -  ETX deal entry only.
 
Purpose:  The business is planning a mock trading session tentatively for 2/7 (Thursday). The plan is to use the UBS production systems. The traders will be using the EOL Stack Manager and their own real products. The originators will be hitting the web site using valid counterparty accounts.  ETX entry should last about 2 hours (probably 9am-11am), however, we need to settle these in the afternoon.
UBSW personnel will be monitoring the transactions from deal entry to SAP.
 

User involvement:  See attached schedule.   Please review and respond if any changes are needed.
 
We are requesting the same counterparties as above, but awaiting ETX's response.  We would like this to go as smooth as possible.
 
Questions, issues, please contact me!

Subject: PROGRESS REPORT - Netco testing schedule for Monday, Feb 4th


Below is an end of day progress report on Monday's regression test.
 
Summary:  
We did complete as planned the 25 types of transactions, including global data setup, deal entry (EOL, Sitara, TDS, EnPower) scenarios.    EOL passed us 25 Gas and 40 power scenarios of which we tested a subset of transactions.  Today's test went a bit smoother given we pushed for the counterparties, contracts to be setup in advance.  We will continue with the Gas settlement on Tuesday morning, along with SAP processing at 1:00pm.
 
From a technical code perspective, there were no major interface issues.  Including TDS/ Sitara interface to Tagg as discussed earlier.
Errors reported include continued NT userid "pilot burn-in" issues, as well as replication issues with data.  Given we are processing in a very 'truncated' environment, downstream systems can have missing global data needed (regions, facilities, SAP information).  The open issues are being escalated and should be addressed by 10:00am tomorrow morning.
 

The goals of this regression test on Monday/ Tuesday are:
1) regression test a subset of scenarios (ie Physical Gas Sale, Physical Power Supply, Financial Swap, Intercomapny) now that the Global Data is more stable (UBS internal counterparties, profit centers, desks/ books) 
2) Identify any reference to internal/ external screens that still have 'ENRON' reference, or 'EOL' reference
3) Ensure we have the latest price curve data from updates (ie TAGG/ERMS)
4) process new EOL data created for Monday.  To verify mid/ back office, including SAP processing.   EOL will also push data from a mock trading session for on 2/7 (see below) 
5) provide the test data scenarios for SAP testing (scheduled Tuesday 1pm).  SAP is completing their setup with the new controlling area for NetCo. 
6) Continue with NT Logins involved with PILOT until remaining are ported.
 
 
Accomplishments/  what worked?
1) Confirmation/ updates of most recent price curves into ERMS.  The data prior was from mid December.
2) Working with only the subset of counterparties as authorized as 'Active'
3) EOL deals did flow downstream.  However, the major were future periods that we cannot settle.  We modified the data to correspond to what downstream needed.
4) Gas - Volume Management, Logistics, and leading into Settlement
5) Power/ Financial  - EnPower/ Tagg, confirmations, leading into settlement
 
 
What did not?
1) Canada testing is still catching up, but improving.  They are identifying the counterparties, pipelines, test scenarios and anticipate continuing to test Tuesday.   
2) Facilities missing, Canada pipelines missing, contracts not replicating into Unify (resolved). 
3) Unify Tagg Deal Load.  The Unify Tagg Deal load was discovered at 5pm, and will be addressed early Tuesday am.
 
Focus on Tuesday
Given the new SAP environment has not been tested to date, we will monitor the Unify transmission/ SAP processing (scheduled for 1pm till).  
There is much risk within SAP given the new counterparties, entities, xref tables, SAP information is just being setup.  We will also validate the intercompany transactions created on Monday.
 
Note:  Tuesday night (6pm - 8pm) is the scheduled NetCo test with Estate Shutdown.
