Hello, Connie!    We're going forward, as planned, with the November 1 DRY RUN Budget Review with Stan Horton, and Jeff Sommers will present for the International Group at this meeting on November 1.   

We have yet to hear from Causey/Lay about rescheduling the November 8 Budget Plan Review meeting with Mr. Lay.   I will keep you posted on this one.

Let me know if I need to further clarify anything.

Cindy

	Cindy,

		I spoke with Jim on Friday regarding the above and he told me you were working on rescheduling this meeting.  The meeting is scheduled for Thursday, Nov. 1st.  Jim has to be in Washington on Thursday for a meeting.  Any luck with rescheduling?
