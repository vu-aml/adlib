HOUSE PASSES ECONOMIC STIMULUS;  CRITICS SAY WORKER AID
FALLS SHORT

By a vote of 216-214, the House passes a broad economic
stimulus bill (H.R. 3090) that includes provisions to expand
unemployment insurance and health care benefits for laid-off
workers. Seven Republicans voted against the proposal, while
three Democrats voted in favor. Rep. Johnson (R-Conn.) says
the bill, sponsored by House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Thomas (R-Calif.), would put $9 billion into state
coffers within 10 days of enactment.

 The bill would allow states to use the funds to pay regular
unemployment benefits, increase benefit payments, extend
benefits beyond 26 weeks, expand benefit eligibility, or for
administrative purposes. The bill also would extend the work
opportunity tax credit and the welfare-to-work tax credit
through Dec. 31, 2003, and contains provisions to boost the
Social Services Block Grant program by $3 billion so that
states can give health coverage to the unemployed.

Critics of the bill--including congressional Democrats,
labor, and civil rights groups--claim the measure will not
accomplish the Republicans' stated goals of stimulating the
economy and getting displaced workers back on the job. A
substitute measure offered by House Democrats is rejected by
a vote of 261-166. Senate Majority Leader Daschle (D-S.D.)
tells reporters that he hopes the Senate will be able to
pass its own version of an economic stimulus bill before
Thanksgiving. . . . Page AA-1

ARKANSAS COURT ORDERS TRIAL ON WHETHER BIPOLAR DISORDER IS
PHYSICAL

A former Smith Barney employee is entitled to a trial to
decide whether his bipolar affective disorder is a mental
illness subject to a 24-month cap on benefits under a
long-term disability policy or a physical illness not
subject to a cap, the Arkansas Supreme Court rules
unanimously ("Elam v. First Unum Life Ins. Co., "Ark., No.
00-1430, 10/18/01). Reversing summary judgment for First
Unum Life Insurance Co., the supreme court holds that
because both the insurer and James Elam submitted evidence
outside of the insurance policy to support their
interpretations of the term "mental illness," the issue is a
question of fact for a jury to decide.

The policy defines mental illness as "mental, nervous or
emotional diseases or disorders of any type." Arguing the
term is ambiguous, Elam says bipolar affective disorder is a
physical illness with a biological origin that is treated
with medication. . . . Page A-1

SIXTH CIRCUIT BLOCKS MOVE TO SEPARATE FLSA, LMRA CLAIMS

A former truck driver's attempt to separate claims he
brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the
Labor-Management Relations Act in order to avail himself of
the FLSA's two-year statute of limitations falls short, as
the Sixth Circuit finds the wage claim barred by the federal
labor law's six-month limitations period ("Martin v. Lake
County Sewer Co., "6th Cir., No. 00-00228, 10/17/01). In
addition to seeking unpaid wages under the FLSA after his
discharge, Donald Martin charged his former employer, Lake
County Sewer Co., with violating the terms of its collective
bargaining agreement with a Teamsters local in violation of
LMRA Section 301. Martin also contended that the union
violated its duty of fair representation under Section 301
by failing to pursue a grievance against Lake for allegedly
improper deductions in his benefits and pay.

Martin argues his FLSA claim is distinct from the Section
301 claim and therefore governed by the wage law's two-year
limitations period. According to the Sixth Circuit, however,
Martin's charge relating to the unpaid wages was based on
the provision in the collective bargaining agreement
governing compensation and must be resolved in accordance
with LMRA procedures. . . . Page A-8

NURSE'S AIDE ASSAULTED BY CO-WORKER CAN PROCEED WITH SUIT

A nurse's assistant who was sexually assaulted by a
co-worker can proceed with a series of claims against an
upstate New York health care facility, despite the fact that
the employer immediately suspended and later discharged the
alleged attacker, a federal magistrate judge rules ("Becker
v. Ulster County, "N.D. N.Y., No. 99-CV-1278, 10/10/01).

Rejecting a summary judgment motion by Ulster County Golden
Hill Health Care Center, Judge Homer of the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of New York finds that Gail
Becker established enough evidence to go to trial on her
claims of sexual harassment based on a hostile work
environment and retaliation under Title VII of the 1964
Civil Rights Act and other laws.

Her evidence surrounding the assault incident--including her
supervisor's failure to allow Becker to call the police and
the facility's refusal to allow her time off to seek a
protective order--if credited, "establishes an incident
sufficient by itself to support a finding that the
conditions of her employment were irrevocably altered as a
result and that those conditions became abusive," the court
holds. . . . Page A-2

FED FINDS MANY REGIONS REBOUNDING FROM SEPTEMBER

The terrorist attacks on New York and Washington stunted
economic growth throughout the country in September, but
many regions saw activity rebound in recent weeks, the
Federal Reserve reports in its "Beige Book" summary of
economic conditions in each of its 12 districts.

Business activity recovered quickly from some aspects of the
attacks, such as reduced air cargo capacity, but long-run
effects are more difficult to assess, according to the Fed.
New since the attacks, however, are disruptions to
productivity due to increased security precautions and
insurance premiums, the central bank says. . . . Page D-12
