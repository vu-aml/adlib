Hi again!

The LABC has been able to get a discount of $100 on the tour price from Executive Tours, thus lowering the total price to $2,369 in Double Occupancy and $2,885 in Single Occupancy. However, the discount will apply ONLY if we get a minimum of 10 registrants.  

The tour has more than five registrants so far, and the new lower prices will apply to new passengers as well as currently registered passengers.  In case the tour do not get a minimum of ten passengers, anyone who registers may request a full refund of their deposit. 

Because of these new price cuts, we have extended the deadline to November 2.  Executive Tours must receive deposits and registrations no later than November 2.

If you need more information or want to sign up for the trip please call Richard Price at 1-800-521-0070 or (714) 897-0074, or send him an email to exectours@earthlink.net.
