Please accept my apologies; I just saw the notice of this meeting a few minutes ago.  (I also did not review my voicemail timely enough...)  My wife stopped by the office at 3:30 and I accompanied her and my daughter to the Medical Center for an appointment.
 
I will be in the office tomorrow and will follow up to see how I can help out in this effort.
 
Rick
