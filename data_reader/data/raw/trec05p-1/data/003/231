TWO NLRB RULINGS ON ALLIEDSIGNAL REACH DIFFERENT RESULTS IN
D.C. CIRCUIT

In two decisions involving AlliedSignal's acquisition of
operations at an Army engine plant in Stratford, Conn., a
federal appeals court upholds a National Labor Relations
Board ruling that the company illegally terminated
collectively bargained severance benefits, but overturns a
separate board ruling that the company improperly ended a
side agreement.

The District of Columbia Circuit agrees with the board that
AlliedSignal, which has since been acquired by Honeywell
International Inc., committed an unfair labor practice by
unilaterally terminating severance benefits when an
agreement expired with the United Auto Workers regarding the
effects of AlliedSignal's acquisition ("Honeywell Int'l Inc.
v. NLRB, "D.C. Cir., No. 00-1171, 6/29/01). Finding no
bargaining impasse or union waiver, the appeals court
decides AlliedSignal was barred from making unilateral
changes regarding severance benefits, a mandatory subject of
bargaining. The second ruling involves AlliedSignal's
termination of a competitiveness agreement containing job
protections. The appeals court decides the issue only
involves contract interpretation, which is for arbitrators
and the courts to decide ("Honeywell Int'l Inc. v. NLRB,
"D.C. Cir., No. 00-1170, 6/29/01). . . . Page AA-1

NURSING HOME WORKER WINS FMLA CLAIM, MAY PROCEED WITH ADA
SUIT

A Pittsburgh nursing home violated the Family and Medical
Leave Act when it fired a former assistant nursing director
who took medical leave after being diagnosed with clinical
depression, the U.S. District Court for the Western District
of Pennsylvania holds ("Wilson v. Lemington Home for the
Aged, "W.D. Pa., No. 99-1893,  6/25/01).

Marva J. Wilson gave the Lemington Home for the Aged
adequate notice that she needed to take the leave, but the
employer failed to provide her with a written notice of her
legal obligations, the company's expectations of her under
its FMLA policy, and any consequence she might face for
failing to meet these expectations, Judge Ambrose rules,
granting Wilson summary judgment on her FMLA claims. Ambrose
also denies the employer's bid for summary judgment on
Wilson's claim that she was discriminated against in
violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. . . . Page

OSHA PLANNING TO EXPAND INJURY SURVEY TO CONSTRUCTION IN
2002

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration plans to
expand its mandatory injury survey in 2002 to target between
15,000 and 20,000 construction companies, OSHA officials
tell BNA. The expansion would represent the first look at an
industry that so far has eluded a data-gathering effort,
begun by the Clinton administration nearly five years ago.

The plan, which one OSHA source says will be outlined in a
"Federal Register" notice slated for publication in late
July, is scaled back from a proposal unveiled a year ago to
survey about 56,000 construction companies in 2001. The
"Federal Register" notice is expected to seek comments on
the proposal as the first formal step toward implementing
the construction survey. . . . Page A-3

NO ERISA BAR TO PHARMACIST'S STATE CLAIMS OVER CVS'S HIRING
DATE

Reversing a lower court,  the North Carolina Court of
Appeals finds no preemption under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act on a pharmacist's state law action
alleging retail drug chain CVS breached a contract and
engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices by selecting
an improper hire date for calculating his pension benefits
("Vaughn v. CVS Revco D.S. Inc., "N.C. Ct. App., No.
COA00-159, 7/3/01).

Pharmacist William Edward Vaughn's state law claims do not
attempt to require an employee benefit plan to provide
particular terms or to regulate the types of benefits the
plan must provide, the appeals court says.  Rather, Vaughn's
"claims simply seek to enforce, or secure compensation for
the breach of an alleged agreement as to the date of hire
for purposes of determining plaintiff's pension benefits,"
the court says.

 Vaughn was hired by Revco drug stores on Feb. 15, 1972; in
August 1995 CVS acquired Revco.  Vaughn alleged that CVS in
hiring him confirmed by letter that he would "retain [his]
tenure showing a date of hire of February 15, 1972," and
"[a]ll benefits will be applicable per [his] tenure." Vaughn
brought suit in a North Carolina state court, however, after
CVS agents later told him his pension benefits would be
calculated as of the date he was hired by CVS in 1995. . . .

CARPENTERS, MASON TENDERS NEGOTIATE FIVE-YEAR CONTRACTS IN
NEW YORK

New five-year collective bargaining agreements went into
effect July 1 for at least 19,000 union carpenters and mason
tenders in the five boroughs of New York City.

The Carpenters and Joiners District Council of New York and
Vicinity negotiated separate agreements with the Building
Contractors Association of New York and the Association of
Wall-Ceiling and Carpenters Contractors of Long Island and
New York City. Both agreements provide wage and fringe
benefit increases of $14.52 per hour over the contract term.
The agreements cover at least 9,000 workers.

BCA also concludes a separate five-year agreement with the
Mason Tenders District Council of the Laborers International
Union that provides wage and benefit increases totaling
$7.50 per hour over term for approximately 10,000 workers in
the five boroughs of New York City. . . . Page A-4
