Geoff-
I am sending three confirms for you to view, however, the comments on these deals are switchable rights / we can point transport to secondary delivery.  I am unclear what you are trying to do, please pick one of the selections below to go in the confirms that stats what you are trying to say.  Also, what is the secondary delivery point.

1.  Buyer has the option to take gas at either Delivery Point upon proper notice to Seller prior to the pipeline nomination deadline for any Period of Delivery.

2.  Prior to the pipeline nomination deadline, either party may select a secondary Delivery Point from among (list point(s)) or any other mutually agreeable point.
	
	3.  Buyer, at its option and upon proper notice to Seller prior to the pipeline nomination deadline, shall have the 	right to change Delivery Points up to ??? times during the Period of Delivery

   
Thanks
