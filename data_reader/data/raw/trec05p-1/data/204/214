Crude Oil Futures Inch Upward

    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX inched 
upward by $0.03 to $18.00 per barrel in an abbreviated session on 
Friday. The IEA reported that OPEC exports moved closer to the 
cartels limits. According to the agency, the cartels total 
production, including Iraq, dropped from 26.04 million bpd in 
November to 25.65 million bpd for December. However, excluding Iraq, 
the other 10 members of OPEC increased their December production by 
380,000 bpd to 23.65 million bpd, still above its self-imposed limits 
of 23.2 million bpd. The IEA said that global oil demand rose 100,000 
bpd last year, the smallest rise since 1985. For 2002, the agency 
projects a 600,000 bpd increase in oil consumption, assuming an 
economic recovery has begun by mid-year. In the US, inventories are 
at their highest levels in over 2 years as the peak heating oil 
season slips into spring. OPECs latest production cut on January 1st 
has yet to be felt in the US and there are many concerns about the 
degree to which exports have been reduced. The IEA says that the 
implementation of the production cut commitments have the potential 
to support crude prices and set the stage for later price gains. A 
draw in oil stocks should deepen in the 1st quarter because of the 
cuts, and an expected seasonal build in the 2nd quarter should be 
less than previously expected, the IEA said. Heating oil futures for 
February delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.0004 to $0.5141 per gallon. 
February gasoline futures on the NYMEX rose $0.0031 to $0.5392 per 
gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for March delivery on the 
IPE were up $0.04 to $18.45 per barrel.

California Nears Deadline to Remove MTBE from Gasoline 

    California has until the end of this year to remove MTBE from 
gasoline and replace it with ethanol. But state officials are worried 
they won't meet the deadline and that could drive up gasoline prices. 
The delay could also prove a problem for the governor. In early 1999, 
he declared MTBE a threat because studies showed it was leaking into 
the state's groundwater. He ordered it banned by the end of 2002, in 
favor of ethanol, which is made from corn. But three years later, 
MTBE is still in use in the state's reformulated gasoline. The 
gasoline additive problem has parallels to last year's energy crisis. 
Davis faces several infrastructure obstacles to getting ethanol-based 
fuel in California. Last year, US ethanol production was more than 
1.8 billion gallons. California will need nearly 950 million gallons 
per year, requiring a production increase. That increase would 
necessitate production and transportation upgrades for the ethanol 
plants, which are behind schedule in making the changes. It also 
requires an estimated $100 million in new equipment and refineries in 
California. A lack of rail transport could also contribute to supply 
problems, making gasoline prices rise as much as $0.50 per gallon.

Book Predicts Imminent Decline of World Oil Supplies 
  

    Even though the world is now experiencing what appears to be an 
overabundance of oil, with lowered demand and brimming inventories, a 
new book "Hubbert's Peak: The Impending World Oil Shortage" advances 
the idea that crude oil supplies will peak within the next 7 years, 
then slowly begin to dwindle. The book contends that the world will 
not be prepared to deal with the situation when the peak in 
production occurs. The book says several events could zap supplies 
and create an energy crisis, including a big war in the Middle East. 
It points out that while there still may be a few huge oilfields left 
to discover, most have, or will shortly reach their maximum output 
level and begin to dry up. According to the book, most new 
discoveries since 1975 have been mediocre. The book is based on 
theories by a geologist who accurately predicted in the mid 1950s 
that US crude production would reach its zenith in 1970. The US now 
depends on imports for over half of its crude consumption. Critics of 
the theory do not argue with the eventual outcome, but they do argue 
that the timetable is too severe. They acknowledge that there will be 
a day when the world's oil output will start to shrivel, but point 
out that improved technologies and economies will delay the decline. 
Many believe that there is still sufficient oil supply in the Middle 
East, but Western powers have imposed economic sanctions that have 
restricted its production. In addition, new technologies being 
developed will decrease demand, expanding the timetable for the 
deterioration of oil supplies. Detractors point to the increased 
usage of natural gas, development of fuel cells, conservation, new 
methods that allow oil sands mining as well as solar, wind and 
geothermal technologies will diminish dependence upon oil as a fuel.

Refiners to Begin Seasonal Maintenance Early

    Poor refining margins and sizable gasoline imports expected from 
Europe have prompted some US refiners to begin planned 1st quarter 
maintenance earlier than usual this year. The shut down of refineries 
for retooling could mean that gasoline stocks may not build as fast 
as usual in the near future, but plants should be ready to produce at 
high levels leading into the peak summer driving season. Summer 
gasoline prices will likely be less than the last 2 years, but the 
seasonal rise in gasoline demand should cause retail prices to rise 
above current levels. Valero has announced an ambitious schedule for 
planned maintenance at half of its refineries. Orion, ChevronTexaco, 
Citgo, Premcor, and Crown Central all have gasoline units down for 
maintenance which are expected to return to operation in February. 
ChevronTexaco's 295,000 bpd Pascagoula, MS refinery and Citgo's 
310,000 bpd Lake Charles, LA refinery are expected to close their 
gasoline units for scheduled maintenance sometime in the first 
quarter. Venezuela's state oil company will shutdown a 108,000 bpd 
gasoline unit in early February. The scheduled maintenance is not 
expected to produce the restricted supply that the nation experienced 
last year when gasoline futures hit a record of $1.17 per gallon in 
May. Gasoline demand has been unexpectedly heavy recently, spurred on 
by low prices, a decrease in flying since September 11th and record 
sales late last year for SUVs. However, isolated markets in the 
Midwest and California, where a lack of pipeline capacity and heavy 
environmental controls on gasoline limit supply options, could see 
prices spike.

CNOOC to Purchase Repsol's Indonesian Assets


    CNOOC has agreed to buy the Indonesian assets of Spanish oil 
major Repsol-YPF for $585 million in cash, its biggest international 
expansion ever. The purchase will bring 360 million barrels of oil 
equivalent in proved net working interest reserves and add 15 – 20 
million BOE to CNOOC's annual output. Standard & Poor's estimated in 
a report that the acquisition would increase daily output by 17% to 
356,000 BOE in 2002, and boost reserves to 1.985 billion BOE. CNOOC 
is now targeting 2002 output of 125 – 130 million BOE. Its previous 
target was 110 million BOE. CNOOC plans to keep its annual output 
growth rate of 15% in the next several years, and estimates its 2001 
output at 95 million BOE. For Repsol, the sale is part of its 
longstanding strategy of selling non-core assets to reduce its $20 
billion debt. Repsol plans to cut its capitalization ratio, debt to 
market cap plus debt, to 30% - 35% from 47% at the end of the 3rd 
quarter. The acquisition will make CNOOC the largest offshore oil 
producer in Indonesia. It already has a presence there through a 
39.5% interest in the Malacca Strait production-sharing contract. 
Merrill Lynch is the advisor to the acquisition. CNOOC expects its 
capital expenditure for 2002 to reach $1.5 – $1.6 billion, including 
the purchase.

Shell Begins Production from Two New Gulf of Mexico Fields

    Two new sub-sea fields in the Gulf of Mexico, Crosby and Einset, 
have started up, according to Shell Exploration & Production. All 
three wells at the Crosby development, located in Mississippi Canyon 
Blocks 898 and 899, are online and producing 20,000 barrels of oil 
per day. Peak production for Crosby is expected to be 60,000 bpd and 
90 MMcf per day by the end of the first quarter. Shell operates 
Crosby, located in 4,400 feet of water, and has a 50% interest in the 
project. BP owns the other 50%. Einset is currently producing at a 
rate of 30 MMcf per day. It is expected to recover in excess of 30 
Bcf of natural gas. Peak production is expected to reach at least 60 
MMcf per day. It is located in 3,500 feet of water and is a single 
well project located in Viosca Knoll Block 872. Shell operators 
Einset and holds a 50% interest. Dominion Exploration & Production 
holds the remaining interest.
