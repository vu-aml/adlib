NLRB ALJ RECOMMENDS AVONDALE REIMBURSE GOVERNMENT FOR LEGAL
FEES

Finding that Avondale Industries conducted a "pervasive
course of unlawful conduct" before and during a union
organizing drive among some 4,000 employees at its New
Orleans shipyard, a National Labor Relations Board
administrative law judge recommends that the company be
required to repay the federal government some $5.4 million
in legal fees it billed the Navy. The ALJ also recommends
that Avondale, which is now owned by Northrup Grumman, be
required to reinstate 22 employees who were illegally
terminated for their union activities ("Avondale Industries
Inc. and New Orleans Metal Trade Council, "N.L.R.B. ALJ, No.
15-CA-12639,7/6/01 [released 7/11/01])

In a 275-page decision, ALJ Philip P. McLeod further
recommends that the company be required to reimburse both
NLRB and the New Orleans Metal Trade Council for their
litigation fees, as well as the NLRB general counsel's
expenses in investigating the ULP cases. . . . Page AA-1

HOUSE HEARING EXAMINES OVERLAP IN GENETIC BIAS LEGISLATION

In the first House hearing this year on legislation that
would ban genetic discrimination in employment and health
insurance (H.R. 602), lawmakers question whether a
broad-based bill is necessary given existing federal and
state laws that address the issue.

Rep. Stearns (R-Fla.), who chairs the House Energy and
Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer
Protections, asks sponsors of the legislation--Reps.
Slaughter (D-N.Y.) and Morella (R-Md.)--whether a new law is
necessary.  He cites the 1996 Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act, which prohibits private group health
insurers from setting rates or refusing coverage to
individuals based on their genetic makeup.  Saying only
people who are currently insured are covered by HIPAA,
Slaughter maintains that any congressional effort to ban
genetic discrimination should encompass both employment and
health insurance and should contain "meaningful enforcement
and remedies." . . . Page A-8

FORD ANNOUNCES CHANGE IN ANNUAL EVALUATION SYSTEM FOR
MANAGERS

Ford Motor Co. announces it is changing a controversial
annual evaluation system for its approximately 18,000
managers and supervisors that has triggered a spate of age
discrimination suits. In a memorandum explaining the change
to employees, Ford Chief Executive Officer Jacques Nasser
acknowledges that the original program had not been entirely
well received, saying the negative feedback "has centered
around what was viewed as an inflexible system by some, and
as discriminatory by a few others." But he insists the
evaluation program "has "nothing" to do with age or
diversity. It has "everything" to do with inspiring the best
performance of "everyone" on the management team."

A class action lawsuit against Ford for age discrimination
brought by about 60 managers "is proceeding full steam
ahead" despite the company's announcement that it is
changing the evaluation system at issue, class attorney
Michael Pitt says. "There are substantial economic and
noneconomic injuries to these people, ranging from $20,000
to $50,000 each, and Ford has given no indication that it
will correct these injuries," the attorney says. . . . Page

STATE'S IMMUNITY DID NOT BAR ADA SUIT, BUT WORKER COULD NOT
PROVE CASE

Even though the sovereign immunity doctrine did not block a
public employee's Americans with Disabilities Act suit
against the head of the Kansas Department of Corrections,
the plaintiff, who had multiple sclerosis, failed to
establish that he was disabled under the act, the Tenth
Circuit rules ("Frazier v. Simmons,  "10th Cir.,  No.
00-3131,  7/3/01).

A state's Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity to suits in
federal court that seek money damages for ADA violations
does not apply where a plaintiff seeks prospective equitable
relief from a particular state official, Judge Brorby holds,
finding that Steve E. Frazier properly alleged a claim for
injunctive relief against the secretary of the Department of
Corrections. However, Frazier failed to establish that he
was qualified for his job--a crime scene investigator--at
the time he was terminated because he could not perform
certain essential functions, the court says, affirming
summary judgment for Simmons.  . . . Page A-7,  Text E-1

CONTRACTOR BACK WAGE PAYMENTS TIED TO GOVERNMENT
REIMBURSEMENT

A government contractor who underpaid its employees due to a
misunderstanding regarding Labor Department wage
classifications need not reimburse those employees until the
contracting agency adjusts the compensation levels to
reflect those classifications, the Federal Circuit rules
("Richlin Security Service Co. v. Immigration and
Naturalization Service,"Fed. Cir., No. 00-1134, 7/2/01).
Richlin Security Service Co. is not liable for the back
wages owed to its security guards for services provided
under contracts with the Immigration and Naturalization
Service until it receives reimbursement from the agency,
according to the court.

 Overturning a decision by the Department of Transportation
Board of Contract Appeals, the court upholds an agreement
between the company and the Labor Department stipulating
that the employees would be paid the back wages owed
following reimbursement by the INS. "In view of the
DOL-Richlin agreement which assures Richlin will receive no
benefit from these payments, it was unnecessary to require
Richlin to pay the employees before INS supplied the funds
to which it was obligated," the court holds. . . . Page A-2

ELEVENTH CIRCUIT RULES ADEA PLAINTIFFS MAY NOT PLEAD
DISPARATE IMPACT

In a case of first impression, the Eleventh Circuit rules
that disparate impact claims may not be brought under the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("Adams v. Florida
Power Corp., " 11th Cir.,  No. 99-15306,  7/5/01). "The text
of the ADEA is sufficiently different from Title VII [of the
1964 Civil Rights Act] to raise doubts about extending the
disparate impact theory of liability to ADEA cases," Judge
Birch writes. In addition, "the history of the ADEA differs
from the legislative history of Title VII."

The Second, Eighth, and Ninth circuits allow disparate
impact claims under the ADEA, while the First, Third, Sixth,
Seventh, and Tenth do not, the court says. Finding the
reasoning of the First and Tenth Circuits persuasive, the
Eleventh Circuit affirms a ruling by the U.S. District Court
for the Middle District of Florida decertifying a class of
former Florida Power Corp. employees who alleged they were
discharged in violation of the ADEA. . . . Page A-2
