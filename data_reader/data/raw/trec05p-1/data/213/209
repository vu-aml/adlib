Can you do me a favor and check to see if the 1-31 files are posted to Sparky before you leave tonight and then again tomorrow?  I'm curious to see if they somehow disappear overnight or if I'm just dreaming when think I post them daily.  I always check to make sure the files got across before I exit the program, so I can think of no reason why they would not be there when you open the site.  Please let me know and thanks.
Michael
