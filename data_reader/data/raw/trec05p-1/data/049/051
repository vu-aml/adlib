 I know that , as a result of yesterday's national tragedy, there are many of you  stranded throughout the U.S....Please check with the Enron websites and Travel Agency in the Park( open 24 hours) for information on how best to get home- Please  feel free to utilize all reasonable and safe ways to return home...you will be reimbursed for such efforts. Please also feel free to extend your stays as necessary until you are comfortable returning home. There isn't much more to say about yesterday's events that hasn't already been said - they are tragic beyond an imaginable level...but, the fact that  each of you and your family's are safe is very important to me and many others. This event will be with us for a long time to come, but a sense of normalcy will, in time, return to our business and what we do in Government Affairs..but,in the meantime,  stay safe, enjoy your families, and get home when you can if you are away. Feel free to call me at 281-831-3749 if there is anything at all I can do to help.
