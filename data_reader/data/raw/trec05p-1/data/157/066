DEAR:DIRECTOR

                                           TRANSFER OF FAMILY FUND 

With due respect trust and humility, I write to you irrespective of the fact you do not know me, but please do consider this letter as a request from a widow and family in dire need of assistance. I am Mrs. Lydia Zuma, the widow of late Mr. James Zuma. The renowned Zimbabwe wine and cattle ranch farmer and owner of ZUMA Farms in Zimbabwe. I got your contact courtesy of a business journal from the Johannesburg information center and chambers of commerce here in south africa in my earnest search for a reliable and trustworthy individual or company that can assist my family in this business.
 Before my husband's death last year 10th MAY 2004, my husband was among the few rich Zimbabwean black farmers, murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of the incumbent President of Zimbabwe Dr.Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority. This land reform mayhem arose when President Mugabe enforced his land reform act; the whole thing resulted to rampant killings and mob Actions by his so-called war veterans against renewed farmers, both whites and blacks alike. Despite the world condemnation of this form of dictatorial leadership, President Mugabe kept using this to subdue and intimidate his political enemies.
 
Farmers were the targets of the so-called veterans; this resulted to the death of a lot of good farmers in our country. Before the death of my husband, he took me to South Africa to deposit some huge amount of money in a security company for safekeeping; this fund was embarked for the purchase of land in Lesotho and Swaziland. He did not disclose the original content of the consignment to the security company. He declared the consignment as 'Archival Antiques' as if he foresees looming danger. My husband specifically drew my attention to his will and to the sum of (US$20.5 Million United States Dollars) that was deposited here in Johannesburg, South Africa with the security company. MY HUSBAND said and I quote "MY DEAR WIFE, I WISH TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MONEY WHICH I DEPOSITED IN SOUTH AFRICA TO FAVOUR YOU. IN CASE AND IN THE CAUSE OF MY ABSENCE ON EARTH, YOU SHOULD MAKE VERY GOOD USE OF THIS FUND FOR THE WELL BEING OF THE ENTIRE FAMILY." 
 
Based on this explanation, your assistance is highly solicited to transfer this money out of here for investment purpose, without the knowledge of my government who had tactically frozen our wealth and the South Africa government seems to be playing along with them. We are faced with dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of seizure since both countries seems to be working together we have been deliberating on how to invest this fund in your country in a confidential manner. We have concluded of investing in a rapidly growing business (Real Estate), which we know is on the rise all over the world. We would like to know the possibility of this, and the amount required to Start up in your country or any other venture you could recommend to us will be welcome 
 
 We are presently living in South Africa as asylum seeker, certain rights such as huge amount or to work while in the country are been denied. Therefore, if you accept to assist us, we are willing to offer you 25% of the total sum, 70% for us and 5% have been mapped out for any expenses that may occur during the cause of this transaction. 

Note: Modalities on how the transfer will be done has been arranged and would be conveyed to you once we have established communication/trust with you. Youre urgent and immediate response will be highly appreciated. Please contact my son Alex Zuma on his private phone number, Tel: 27-73-518-4122 or Email (god_with_me_2@hotmail.com) for more explanations. 

Best regards 
MRS.LYDIA ZUMA
FOR THE FAMILY.
