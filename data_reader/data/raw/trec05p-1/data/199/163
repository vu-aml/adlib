We are trying to wrap up the year end reporting this week.  Please let me know if you are still having issues reporting and/or when to expect the year end data.  Some of you may not be familiar with the "export" process to get data to the Consolidated DPR.  If not, please call me and I can help.
 
David/Cindy- we will only be reporting the European numbers for the ECTRIC business.  
 
Thanks,
