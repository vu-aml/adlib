Latest NFL Player News

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His
status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins.
Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent
Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary
will continue to see some work at his expense.

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/18/01
Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing
defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open
often after starting the year slowly.

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit.
Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better
game this season.

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/18/01
The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23
carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very
thin at RB..

David Sloan, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you
are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks
from Charlie Batch.

Lamont Warren, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64
yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs
and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for
the rest of the year.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 11/18/01
Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for
only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good
Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is
also erratic.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to
get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless
your team is very thin at wideout.

David Terrell, WR CHI - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is
not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 11/18/01
Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his
third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player
you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second-year
receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player.

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards
and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks,
however, which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for
the entire preseason. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 11/18/01
Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. While
he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for
Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable totals.

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 11/18/01
Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98
yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is
becoming somewhat of a gamble. 

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has
not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 11/18/01
Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and
four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the
league and is a must-start every week. 

Jerry Rice, WR OAK - Team Chick Updated 11/18/01
Rice had a huge game on Sunday, catching eight passes for 131 yards and
three touchdowns against San Diego. Rice may not be an every-week starter
in smaller leagues, but he can certainly still put up huge Fantasy numbers
when the matchup is right. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Banks was carted off the field in the second quarter of Sunday's game at
Denver with a concussion. He was replaced by Kent Graham.

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 11/18/01
Favre threw for 262 yards and two TDs against the Falcons, but he was
intercepted three times and lost a fumble. Despite some inconsistent play
in recent weeks, Favre's potential for big games makes him a must-start
every week.

Corey Bradford, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Bradford caught three passes for 117 yards against Atlanta. The Green Bay
wideout is still too inconsistent to be considered a solid Fantasy player.

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Chandler started at Green Bay, and threw for 352 yards, two TDs and two
interceptions. He remains a good Fantasy backup when healthy.

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Christian rushed for 40 yards and caught five passes for 62 yards at Green
Bay. The Falcons are using him more often, and Christian makes a good
backup RB right now.

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/18/01
Grbac threw for 261 yards, two TDs and was intercepted four times by the
Browns. The veteran QB has been a big disappointment this year and should
not start for most Fantasy teams.

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/18/01
Brookins rushed for 89 yards on 21 carries against the Browns. The rookie
is a servicable, yet unspectacular Fantasy player who should give you some
occasional TDs down the stretch. 

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 11/18/01
Couch threw for only 144 yards and was intercepted three times at
Baltimore. The Cleveland QB appears to be a risk even as a Fantasy backup
right now.

Benjamin Gay, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Gay saw his first extensive action of the year, carrying the ball 18 times
for 56 yards and a TD at Baltimore. He displayed good vision and lateral
quickness, and Gay is definitely worth picking up if you need help at RB. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/18/01
Jackson (ankle) did not play at Baltimore. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White
shared carries in his place. 

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 11/18/01
Smith rushed for only 53 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Smith
appears to be mired in mediocrity right now, and he is a risky start unless
you lack depth at RB.

Chris Chambers, WR MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 11/18/01
The rookie wideout caught only two passes for 25 yards against the Jets.
Chambers is still too inconsistent to start for most Fantasy teams.

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/18/01
Moss made his pro debut on Sunday, but did not catch a pass and was stopped
for a six-yard loss on his one carry. The rookie has missed too much time
to make a Fantasy impact this season. 

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Huntley actually had a good outing against San Francisco, posting 94
scrimmage yards and a touchdown. However, he's far too inconsistent to
start on a weekly basis. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/18/01
Weinke started Sunday's game against San Francisco after missing last
week's game due to a shoulder injury. He put up decent numbers, throwing
for 177 yards and two touchdowns in Carolina's 25-22 OT loss. 

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 11/18/01
Chrebet did not catch a pass at Miami. The Jets' wideout is no longer
worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams. 

Garrison Hearst, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Hearst had another strong game, posting 113 scrimmage yards against
Carolina. His comeback from a serious ankle condition is nothing short of
miraculous, and he's actually been a reliable Fantasy player over the last
two weeks. 

Alex Van Pelt, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Van Pelt threw for 316 yards, two TDs and no interceptions against the
Seahawks. He did lose a fumble, but Van Pelt got solid protection for most
of the game and will be a respectable Fantasy backup while he fills in for
the injured Rob Johnson.

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/18/01
Garcia had another huge game, posting 305 yards and three touchdowns
against Carolina. He's been one of the top three Fantasy quarterbacks this
season, and may even be more valuable than Peyton Manning at this point. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
Price caught 10 passes for 138 yards and a TD against Seattle. He has
clearly become Buffalo's best Fantasy player this season.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 11/18/01
Hasselbeck threw for 134 yards, one TD and no interceptions at Buffalo. The
Seattle QB is making less mistakes, yet he doesn't help Fantasy teams much,
either.

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/18/01
Kitna put up 234 yards passing and a touchdown against Tennessee, but two
interceptions made his performance mediocre. He's no better than a reserve
Fantasy player at this point, best used when the matchup is right in a
deeper league. 

Koren Robinson, WR SEA - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Robinson caught two passes for 15 yards at Buffalo, including his first
career TD, a seven-yarder. Robinson is slowly improving, but still does not
produce enough to be a reliable Fantasy player.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 11/18/01
Dillon was held in check by Tennessee, rushing for only 38 yards on Sunday.
However, with all the injured running backs around the league this season,
Dillon is still a must-start on a weekly basis. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/18/01
McNair played despite a sore thumb, throwing for 172 yards and a touchdown
against Cincinnati. He's been an unreliable Fantasy player this season, and
is worth starting only when the matchup is right. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 11/18/01
George was unimpressive once again, posting only 65 scrimmage yards on
Sunday against Cincinnati. He just doesn't seem to be at full speed this
season, and has been a huge Fantasy disappointment. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 11/18/01
Williams had a big game on Sunday, rushing for 120 yards and a touchdown
against Indianapolis. He continues to prove his value as a Fantasy player,
and is a must-start ever week. 

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/18/01
Brooks had an outstanding game against Indianapolis, throwing for 249 yards
and two touchdowns. He's put together two straight solid games, and may
finally be reaching the potential the coaching staff knew he was capable
of. 

Peyton Manning, QB IND - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Manning put up a decent performance against New Orleans, posting 262 yards
and a touchdown. He may not be putting up Manning-like numbers this season,
but he's still far too valuable to ever consider benching. 

Marcus Pollard, TE IND - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Pollard had a huge game on Sunday, catching three passes for 126 yards and
a touchdown against New Orleans. He may not be the most consistent Fantasy
player, but the lack of tight end depth around the league makes him a
valuable commodity. 

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 11/18/01
McNabb was unimpressive on Sunday, compiling only 153 scrimmage yards and a
touchdown against Dallas. Despite the mediocre performance, McNabb is still
one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league. 

Ryan Leaf, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Leaf was horrible for the second straight week, throwing for only 102 yards
with two interceptions. Incidently, both picks were returned for touchdowns
as Dallas fell to Philadelphia, 36-3. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/18/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia in the second half with an
apparent knee injury. He did not return to the game, and finished the day
with 90 scrimmage yards and a fumble. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/18/01
Jackson (ankle) did not start in Sunday's game. Jamel White started against
the Ravens. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/18/01
McNair will start Sunday's game against Cincinnati as long after taking
pre-game snaps without any problems. McNair, who is dealing with a thumb
injury, isn't worth starting on your Fantasy team outside of deeper
leagues. 

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
Green (abdominal strain) is out for Sunday's game. Reidel Anthony will
start in his absence.

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Stewart (ankle) is out for Sunday's game against Arizona. However, coach
Marty Mornhinweg stated that Stewart is making progress, and is getting
closer to returning to action. 

Marco Battaglia, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Battaglia (appendectomy) is out at least a month, and may miss the rest of
the season. The big tight end has no real value as a Fantasy player. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 11/18/01
Brunell (quadriceps) will start on Sunday against Pittsburgh. He'll be
facing a tough Steelers' secondary at less than 100 percent, however, so
Fantasy owners may want to consider benching him in Week 10. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 11/18/01
Taylor (groin) practiced without incident on Friday, but he still needs
medical clearance before he can play in Sunday's game against Pittsburgh.
Even is he is able to play, however, he'd only be used on a limited basis.
Stacey Mack will get the start in any event, so playing Taylor on your
Fantasy team is not a wise move. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/18/01
Pathon (foot) is out for Sunday's game against New Orleans, according to
the <I>Indianapolis Star</I>. Reggie Wayne will start in Pathon's place
once again. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/18/01
Jackson (ankle) will likely be a gametime decison on Sunday against
Baltimore. If the rookie tailback is unable to play, Jamel White will be
Cleveland's featured back with Benjamin Gay getting some looks in the
backfield as well. 

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 11/17/01
Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's game against Dallas. He is
one of three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Brian Mitchell will
likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.

Jamal Lewis, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01
According to published reports, Lewis has been suspended for four games.
Lewis' four-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will not be
allowed to work out or rehabilitate with the team for four weeks, or until
Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn ACL in
Tennessee. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/16/01
Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner
will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in
goal-line situations.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/16/01
According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of
Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a
Fantasy perspective.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati
due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills
Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not
being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/16/01
Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing
two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said
after Friday's practice that Smith would "be ready to play the majority of
the game." His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't
recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/16/01
Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now
listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit. However, if
you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week,
Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth
considering as long as he's able to play. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for
Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on
your Fantasy team. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/16/01
Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of
consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better
quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in
your starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 11/16/01
Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good
to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end
zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the
Giants' secondary on Monday night. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 11/16/01
Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to
an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost
impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy
numbers. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 11/16/01
Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good
player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that
has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start. 

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/16/01
Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347
yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his
potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially
against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 11/16/01
Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11
catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis
squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this
week is a solid option. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's
averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again
emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10
against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three
games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can
be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep
Fantasy leagues. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/16/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three
touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this
weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is
worth considering. 

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three
passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against
Denver, however, so starting him is a good move. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/16/01
Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your
Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a
tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of
deeper leagues. 

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 11/16/01
Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored
only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary
this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on
his potential to put up solid numbers. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 11/16/01
Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one
of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the
formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on
his potential for big numbers. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 11/16/01
Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best
Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post
solid numbers in Week 10 against New England. 

Ernie Conwell, TE STL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/16/01
Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is
somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the
league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will
have no choice but to do. 

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/16/01
Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but
don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting
either back in Week 10 if at all possible. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 11/16/01
Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis.
He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a
real gamble. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 11/16/01
Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one
of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San
Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/16/01
Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75
yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this
week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 11/16/01
Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this
season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable
secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 11/16/01
Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in
eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better
option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on
a weekly basis. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/16/01
Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected
to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against
Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green
Bay. 

Reuben Droughns, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfield
this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much Fantasy
value outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble. 

Lamont Warren, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday
against Arizona. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth
starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
Batch will again lose playing time to Mike McMahon this week. McMahon will
be the No. 2 QB again, but will see playing time as the Lions continue to
use two quarterbacks. As a result, you may want to look for another
signal-caller to start on your Fantasy team. 

David Sloan, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Sloan is an unreliable tight end, which was proven in his one-catch for
minus-2 yard performance in Week Nine. Unless you play in a deeper league,
starting Sloan isn't advisable. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/16/01
Dayne has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks.
He may score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for
Fantasy owners overall. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/16/01
Collins has been inconsistent this season, but the matchup this week
against Minnesota is very favorable. He lit up the Vikings for 381 yards
passing and five touchdowns in last year's NFC Championship game, and is
worth taking a chance on in Week 10. 

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/16/01
Jurevicius has put up some solid Fantasy numbers in certain games this
season, but he's been inconsistent overall. However, facing a porous
Minnesota secondary on Monday makes him worth considering in larger Fantasy
leagues. 

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/16/01
Wycheck sat out practice Thursday to rest his injured ankle. He is listed
as questionable for Sunday's game. Don't expect him to be too reliable if
he plays. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 11/16/01
Hilliard has caught three touchdowns in his last three games, so starting
him against Minnesota is advisable. The Vikings' secondary is questionable
at best, so look for Hilliard to be productive. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/16/01
Toomer could find some real success on Monday night against Minnesota. The
Vikings sport one of the worst secondaries in the league, so starting
Toomer based on the matchup is a wise move.
