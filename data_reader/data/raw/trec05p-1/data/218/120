Attached is the customer priority list.

This is intended to be the "pre-approved" list for companies to be ready on launch day and includes US and Canadian entities in gas and power.

I have most recently been told that individual legal names are not wanted in this list - only group names. If individual legal names are needed, let me know - I can provide the list that way as well.

Note that there are about 25 more names on this list than the list previously supplied to credit. It appears a number of Canadian companies some non-online companies were not included in the original list. This most recent list includes these names and provides an order of priority for them.

I will be sending another list later, which will identify the type of Master Agreement priority for each (ISDA, Physical Gas, Physical Power)
