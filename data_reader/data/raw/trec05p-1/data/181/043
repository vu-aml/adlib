Celebrate New Year's Eve 2002 in style with Pure NRG Productions & Bibi 
Magazine.  Dress in your most fashionable threads for this glittering evening 
of internationally-themed fashion, music, dinner and dance.  Enjoy the Bibi 
Fashion Show, dance to the hottest DJ's, taste gourmet cuisine and ring the 
New Year with your fellow hipsters, models, friends and famous faces.  It's a 
night to see and be seen.  Get ready Texas, New Year's Eve has never looked 
this good.   

THE PROGRAM:

          This ultra-glamorous party will be held at the prestigious Westin 
Galleria hotel (located on West Alabama) in Houston, Texas.  Guests will 
arrive at 8 p.m. for this Black Tie event and will be welcomed to a cocktail 
social hour. The anticipation will be building as guests dine on an 
international gourmet palate of delectable cuisine designed to suit 
everyone's taste. 

          At  9:00 pm, guests will take their seats as the main party 
officially begins with an electrifying Bibi Fashion Show, the likes of which 
has yet to be seen in Texas thus far. The fashion show will include a blend 
of designs ranging from exotic South Asian wear to chic American to the 
unexpectedly bizarre. Intermixed throughout the upbeat show will be dancers, 
entertainers, and performance artists, all working to create an ambiance 
perfect for the New Year's arrival. 

          After the Bibi Fashion Show has reached its crescendo, the catwalk 
will convert into a club with the hottest DJ's in Texas spinning the most 
danceable international tracks. The models will invite the crowd to dance 
with them to music that will fuse the hottest sounds of American, Latin, 
Bhangra, and Arabic tunes. 

          At midnight as 2001 ends and 2002 begins, all will raise their 
glasses in a combined countdown and complimentary champagne toast to the New 
Year. Both alcoholic and non-alcoholic champagne will be served. 

          The following hours will be filled with more dancing, dining and 
delirious fun as the DJ's continue to spin even more party music. The buffet 
will be abundant all night long and a cash bar will ensure that each person 
is well taken care of.

·          Don't forget to dress your stylish best as prizes are distributed 
for the best dressed, the most fashionable, the best dancers, the most 
outrageous and more. Prizes will be awarded after midnight, so plan on being 
present to win. 

·         Party favors and special treats will be provided for all to make 
sure this New Year's Eve is unforgettable. 

          A portion of the proceeds will benefit the Red Cross in order to 
help our fellow Americans.
