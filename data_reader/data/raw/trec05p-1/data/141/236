cannot be considered independent. We will benefit from any 
increase in share price of the advertised company. We will 
sell our shares at any time, without notice, be that 
before, during or immediately after the release of this

negative impact on the securities of the company

dilution of the company's securities. Furthermore, our 
associates and/or employees and/or principals may have 
stock positions in advertised companies purchased in the 
open market or in private transactions. These positions may 
be liquidated, without prior notification, even after we 
have made positive comments regarding the advertised

relationship between the reader and us. The stocks of 
advertised companies may trade in fast moving, highly 
volatile markets, and any reader should observe the trading 
behavior of any advertised company prior to investing. 
Advertised stocks are often thinly traded and large sell 
orders will have a substantially negative impact on share 
price. Investors in advertised stocks may experience 
difficulty in selling shares without seeing a decline in 
market price and may have difficulty in finding ready 
buyers of their stock. Information within this 
advertisement contains "forward looking" statements within 
the meaning of Section 27(a) of the U.S. Securities Act of 
1933 and Section 21(e) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act

with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, 
projections, objectives, goals, assumptions or future 
events or performance are not statements of historical 
facts and may be forward looking statements. Forward 
looking statements are based on expectations, estimates and 
projections at the time the statements are made that 
involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could 
cause actual results or events to differ materially from 
those presently anticipated. Forward looking statements may 
be identified through the use of words such as expects, 
will, anticipates, estimates, believes, or by statements 
indicating certain actions may, could or might occur. We
