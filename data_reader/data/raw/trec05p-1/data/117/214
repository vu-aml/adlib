have been put in place to facilitate all pprovals of all necessary docume=
nts

count,
if you accept orindicate interest in this proposal. You are entitle to 30=
%
of the total sum of $15million while 65% is for I and my family, while 5%=

has been mapped out for any local or international expenses if needed be
during the transfer of this 
fund.Our lawyer will contact you as soon as you indicate interest.Try and=

help me sir/madam. This proposal is 100% risk free, as soon as this enter=
s
into your account I want you to help and advice me on what business to in=
vest
the 
money in your country, and also I want you to help me to buy a living hou=
se
for my son because he wants to leave Nigeria.I cannot make use of this mo=
ney
