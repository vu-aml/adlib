to forward to you this business proposal. We want a
reliable person who could assist us to transfer the sum of
Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars
( $20,500,000 )into his / her account.This fund resulted by
way of gratification from a contract awarded by us under
the budget allocation to my Ministry and this bill has been
approved for payment by the concerned Ministries.The
contract has since been executed,commissioned and the
contractor company, paid off. We are left with the balance
of US$20.5M which was given to us by the company for
influencing the contract in their favour amidst heavy
competition from rival companies. But under our protocol
ivision,civil servants are forbidden to operate or own
 foreign accounts. This is why I am contacting you to be
our custodian for this fund.As you may want to know and to
make you less curious, I got your contacts through a
business trade directory after series of intensive search
for possible assistance.

for the transfer of this fund into your designated bank
account will be done by me. I and my colleagues have agreed
to COMPENSATE you duly if agreement is reached by both of
us.
I and one of my colleagues involved in this deal will come
to your 
country to arrange for our share, upon the confirmation
