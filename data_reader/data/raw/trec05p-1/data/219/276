This is the information I've found (below).  There are
"Parental Advisory" stickers on the director's chair, so
maybe that is in the name.  It's clearly about rock and roll
crazies and Congress...

**************

hi everyone,

VH-1 (the cable music channel) is returning to Houston in
January/February 2002 to film another television movie. This
one is called PMRC, which stands for Parent's Music Resource
Center. Remember in 1985 when Tipper Gore tried to have the
music industry censored, resulting in the Parental Advisory
sticker?

VH-1 has filmed three movies in Houston in the past two
years: AT ANY COST, THE WAY SHE MOVES and most recently TOO
LEGIT: THE M.C. HAMMER STORY (currently airing.)

If you would like to be an extra in the upcoming production
PMRC, please visit southwestcasting.com and get on the
emailing list. You will receive a email notification as soon
as the time and date is set for the extras casting call.
Extras will be paid. All types will be needed, ages 16-80.
There is a special need for Senator- and
Washington-Wife-types.

Please forward this information to anyone you think might be
interested.

Thanks!

Joe G.
