					Hello,<BR>

						We mark an important centenary this evening. The hundredth birthday o=
f the caravan park.=20
<br>

<br>
You will no doubt be thinking of Margaret Beckett, at this point. So let me=
 bring the email full circle and start with Foreign Affairs in a part of th=
e world that is looking increasingly volatile tonight:=20
<br>

<br>
<B>Gaza</B>
<br>

<br>
When the Palestinian President himself throws up his hands and cries 'This =
is madness!' you know things aren't going too well in Gaza. Mahmood Abbas r=
eally isn't mincing his words. He's said that without a ceasefire the situa=
tion will collapse.=20
<br>

<br>
Today, gunfire was turned on thousands of unarmed Palestinian civilians dem=
onstrating against violence on both sides - and policemen loyal to Fatah fl=
ed across the border to Egypt to escape Hamas militants.=20
<br>

<br>
So did the West have a role to play in helping to create this chaos - or is=
 this internal wrangling which the West should stay out of? And what can be=
 done to solve the crisis?
<br>

<br>
As ever in the Middle East, it doesn't stop there.
<br>

<br>
<B>Lebanon</B>
<br>

<br>
A car bomb has exploded in Beirut killing an MP and five others. The legisl=
ator - Walid Eido - was well known for his anti Syrian views - and the meth=
od of assassination appears to be the same as that used in the past to assa=
ssinate Syria's opponents. It's almost exactly a year since the war between=
 Hezbollah and Israel was played out on the streets of Lebanon.=20
<br>

<br>
Tonight we ask if the battles between radical groups in the Middle East are=
 gaining momentum.
<br>

<br>
<B>Countryside</B>
<br>

<br>
In the latest in his series on how Blair changed Britain, Jeremy Paxman spe=
nds a day in rural England talking to people, some of whom feel they are Br=
itain's most ignored minority group.=20
<br>

<br>
<B>Caravans</B>
<br>

<br>
Which brings us back, rather nicely, to aforementioned caravans. And Steve =
Smith's celebrations thereof. Ever made a hundredth birthday cake on a camp=
 fire?
<br>

<br>
Do join us at 10.30pm on BBC2.
