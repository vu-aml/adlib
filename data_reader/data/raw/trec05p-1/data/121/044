Hey guys, not sure if you are all still at this
address or not but I wanted to get in touch and give
you an update on where I am in case your e-mail
addresses chnaged.

I left San Francisco a couple of months ago and am now
in Sydney Australia with my girlfriend, working on the
federal election campaign for the local Australian
Liberal Party candidate.  It's been a great experience
so far and a lot of fun.  

I'm planning on being back in school in September for
an MBA if I can pull myself together and finish the
applications.  Our apartmnet is nice and close to
Bondi Beach and the Royal Sydney Golf Club so there
are plenty of distractions.   

I'll keep this short because I'm not sure if it will
reach any of you but if it does, it would be reat to
get a quick note back to let me know what's up.  

Dorland, I still owe you a tie by the way.   

I hope everything is going well guys,
Matt
