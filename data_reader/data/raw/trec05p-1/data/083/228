Team, 

Last week, interviews were held at The University of Michigan for full time Analyst positions.   We really appreciate all of the interviewers and those of you that participated in the resume review meeting for helping with the process.

First round interviews included 24 great candidates.  Second round interviews were narrowed down to 9 candidates.   As a result, we have extended an invitation to the following 4 candidates to participate in the "Fab Friday" (formerly known as Super Saturday) event being held on the weekend of November 15th.

Anand Kesavan			734-730-1025
Raj Mangalick				734-657-7227
Apratim Sen				734-657-5365
Denis Smirnov			734-222-0456

Since cultivation is an intricate part of the recruiting process, the following  team members have been chosen to contact the following candidates to answer any questions they might have about Fab Friday's.  Most of the assigned team members have recently experienced Super Saturday's.


Team Member				Candidate
Ravi Mujumdar				Anand Kesavan	
David Junus					Raj Mangalick
Kristin Quinn					Apratim Sen
Eric Irani					Denis Smirnov



As always, everyone is encouraged to cultivate those candidates invited to Fab Friday.


Thanks
