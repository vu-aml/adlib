	ISO Market Participants:

	As you know, on June 19, the FERC released its "Order On Rehearing
Of Monitoring And Mitigation Plan For The California Wholesale Electric
Markets, Establishing West-Wide Mitigation, And Establishing Settlement
Conference." Since the Order was released, market participants have raised
several questions regarding the Order. The ISO has received several
questions and plans to share those questions and answers with you within the
next few days.

	In addition, in compliance with the June 19 FERC Order, the ISO has
made its compliance filing with FERC. The filing is posted on the ISO web
site at http://www1.caiso.com/pubinfo/FERC/filings/ for your review.

	The ISO will host a conference call from 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. PDT
on Monday, July 16 to discuss questions you may have regarding the FERC's
June 19 Order. The details of the call are as follows:

	Dial-In Number: (877)381-6005

	Conference ID: 1361763

	Leader: Byron Woertz

	Our goal will be to clarify the ways in which the ISO is
interpreting and implementing the FERC Order and to address other
implementation issues you may have. We do not plan to discuss issues that
are pending or are more appropriately addressed at FERC. If you have
specific questions you would like for us to address, please send them to me
by COB on Thursday, July 12 so that we can be better prepared to address
them during the call on Monday. If you have any questions, please call or
e-mail me.
