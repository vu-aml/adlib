MR. JONATHAN MALEKE 
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF AFRICA,
1265 LEVER, ROAD HEADWAY,
HILL MIDRAND, SOUTH AFRICA.

Dear Sir,

I am Mr. Jonathan Maleke, Provincial Director Development Bank of South 
Africa, Hill Midrand Branch. I have urgent and very confidential 
business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a foreign Oil consultant/
contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Richard Moss 
made a numbered time (Fixed)Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued 
at US12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million five Hundred Thousand United States 
Dollars) in my branch. 

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address 
but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we 
discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining 
Corporation that Mr. Richard Moss died from an automobile accident. On 
further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, 
and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. 

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard 
Moss did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, 
including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US12, 500,
000.00 (Twelve Million five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) is 
still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the 
principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to 
claim it. According to South Africa Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) 
years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa 
Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to 
stand In as the next of kin to Mr. Richard Moss so that the fruits of 
this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt 
government officials. 

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names 
and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents 
and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. 

We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for drafting and 
notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and 
letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank 
account in any part of the world which you will provide will then 
facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of 
kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the 
ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. 

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will 
be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees 
the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, 
please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your 
response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant 
documents that will help you understand the transaction. 

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this 
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall 
require your assistance to invest my share in your country. 

Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email address for confidential reasons.

Thanks and regards. 

Mr. Jonathan Maleke
