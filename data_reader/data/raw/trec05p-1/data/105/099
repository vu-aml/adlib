Here is the draft letter to go to AEP tomorrow.  We should basically attach an Exhibit A that shows us owing them no additional working capital and showing them owing us the items due to us on Jim's schedule.

Below is a revised schedule.  There was a formula correction on the first sheet and I also added a column for an adjusted difference based on information provided by David Baumbach.
