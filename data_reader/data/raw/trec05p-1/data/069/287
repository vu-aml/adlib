This notification serves to describe the California ISO charge types
associated with the Discretionary Load Curtailment Program (DLCP).  The DLCP
was designed to provide an additional level of demand reduction on the ISO
system before the ISO entered into Emergency conditions.  DLCP Load
participants agree to voluntarily interrupt Load at ISO request in
accordance with DLCP contracts and ISO operating procedures.  The program
was implemented as a result of forecasted periods of high-energy usage
during summer 2001.  The program was implemented once, on July 3, 2001.  The
charges associated with DLCP will be included on the July 31, 2001
Settlement Statement.
