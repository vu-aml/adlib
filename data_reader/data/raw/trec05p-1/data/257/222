  <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/spacer.gif>	Offer is not retroactive and may not be combined with any other offer, discount or award. A Crown Room Club membership obtained by the redemption of frequent flyer miles is not eligible for this one-time bonus-mileage offer and the $20 discount. If membership purchased includes a spouse card, only one SkyMiles bonus and $20 discount will apply. When mailing a check as payment for your Crown Room Club membership, be sure to deduct $20 from the membership fee for your applicable SkyMiles membership level. Allow six to eight weeks for the bonus miles to appear in your account. Mailed applications must be postmarked by April 15, 2002. Faxed applications must be received by April 15, 2002. All standard Delta SkyMiles program rules and conditions apply. Offer is nontransferable.
