Community Garage Sale 

Date: Saturday, October 27, 2001 
Time: 7:00AM - 12:00PM CDT (GMT-05:00) 

Don't forget about the Neartown community garage sale to be held
on Saturday, October 27, 7 am to noon.  If you would like to
participate, let Amy know ASAP.  Maps of participating houses
will be available for $1 at the police substation, and balloons
will be provided to mark the houses.  It's a great chance to
clean house before the holidays!
