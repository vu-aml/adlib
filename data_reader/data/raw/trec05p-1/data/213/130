Kal came up with a couple of suggestions:

	"TraderKey"
	"QuotesKey"

	- Consistent with other UBS products (like Swisskey)
	- Few syllables
	- Doesn't use the UBS name, so shouldn't be as sensitive to the name police
	- Is generic enough to survive UBS name changes or other companies posting products on the site in the future.
	- Are available as a URL

I especially like "Traderkey", which has positive connotations and provides potential for some interesting marketing campaigns.
