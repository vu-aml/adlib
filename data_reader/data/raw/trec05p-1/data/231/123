Please see the attached files for EPMI

	   

EPMI has no PRM balances.  I have a hard copy of the balance sheet out of Hyperion.  Let me know if you need it.

So, what exactly to they want?  A/R and A/P by counterparty?  #2 I have.  #3 I might have depending on what they mean by position database/trade blotter.

Kent,

I dropped by to see you on the following:

Could you help me get the status on the requests from E&Y that have your name assigned to them?  I need to know if we've already answered the question, and if not, when the answer will be ready.  E&Y has requested a status on all of these.

Your items:

1.  11/30/01 Trading Accounts Receivable and Trading Accounts Payable
2.  11/30/01 Collateral Balances Held and Posted (by Collateral Type, by Counterparty)
3.  11/30/01 Balance Sheet and reconciliation to position database/trade blotter

I've attached the entire list of requests FYI.  I appreciate your help on this.

Regards,
