This product is now in the active status.  Unfortunately, the 7x8 loadshape is out of our hands until the EnPower guys can come up with a solution.  I'll keep our testing/bridging team on it..  Also,  send an email to Stephanie Sever and Karen O'day requesting Execute access for Product Manager (all products you currently have read access for) and Read access for all Nat. Gas.  Be sure to copy your desk head on the email.  Call me with any questions.

Can you please approve the following product for Eric Saibi (EOL Product # 66296).  Any news on the 7X8 product?  Eric wants to roll it out as quickly as possible.    
Additionally, when log into Product Manager.....I am unable to create any products as my access is "read only."  What do I need to do to have this changed and have read only access to gas products added?  

Thanks,

Ryan
