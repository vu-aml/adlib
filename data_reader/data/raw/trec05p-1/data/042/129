Mark,

I just wanted to say a BIG thank you for your recommendation of "This Century." It was truly the only thing separating me from insanity on our drive from Houston to LA. The stories were unbelievable! I want to buy the CD series someday and force everyone in my family to listen to it! I can't thank you enough for the suggestion! I've also thought about you several times as Will watched the OU games! (I watched a little too!!) I was absolutely sure that you were watching the very same thing at the very same moment. Am I right??

Anyway, Will and I love L.A. so far and are definately happy with the weather, our apartment and the life in general. I start work on Tuesday and it will be very interesting to see how it differs from Enron and whether those differences sit well with me or not. I'm sure your having quite and adjustment as well, being in a new group and hopefully one that is less tumultuous! I'd love to hear your experiences!

I also hope that you and Sara are doing well and still enjoying your house and all of the fun things about sharing it together .. I will miss hearing your stories . . .especially about how God is working in your life. It was pretty rare to talk about God with people at Enron and I am thankful that I met you and in you someone who shared the same foundation of faith. I truly wish you many blessings as you start this next phase of your career and hope we will keep in touch!

Sincerely,
Marissa
