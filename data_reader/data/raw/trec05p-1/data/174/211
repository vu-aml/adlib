Attached are the L1 and H1-B termed employees.  Please identify your termed employees from the list (1st attachment and tab 1 are L1's, second attachment, tab 1 are H1-Bs)

Please let the H1-B termed employees know that we will pay for the employee's return ticket home (coach).  Tim Callahan will let you know who to contact to reimburse them for the cost of the ticket.

For the L1 holders, Enron is only obligated to conform with the obligations in the transfer letter, so you will need to pull their letter from the file and review with Tim Callahan.

Tim I have updated the attached files to include employees current status.  I have highlighted in blue those employees where
I could not find a match in our database by the name provided.

Let me know if you need anything else.
