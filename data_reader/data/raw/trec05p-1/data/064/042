Marie / Kimberly,

Thankyou for the documentation you have provided in relation to ECT
Investments. We now have sufficient information to meet our regulatory
requirements and open an account in the name of ECT Investments.

I have advised our sales-desk of this and requested that they arrange for
the account to be opened. We may need to obtain / re-confirm settlement and
confirmation details. This will be done via usual business contacts.

Please do not hesitate to call me with any questions

Thanks & Regards

Rob Daborn
