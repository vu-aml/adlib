Just wanted to drop you a note and congratulate you on your recent 
appointment (or should I say "anointment").

Also wanted to (on the QT) have a discussion about our two company's and 
float an idea. I've been at Harvard for the past two months at the AMP 
program and have had a chance to really look at the direction, gait and 
opportunities for Cinergy and during that same time frame Enron has also 
gone through some dramatic change. As is said "a little bit of knowledge is 
a dangerous thing". It would be a good to see you at the very least and 
grab a good bourbon and cigar.

I'll be out of the program in the middle of November and back in 
Cincinnati. Send me your number and I'll give you a call sometime and we 
can see if there is a reason to do anything but have the bourbon and cigar. 
Congratulations again on the obvious wisdom of the Enron empire. I'm sure 
they're braced for ignition.....

Regards,

Michael Cyrus
