Hi Dave,

As we've been running our numbers on this proposal, I was curious if your
offer of $13MM factors in any kind of tax make-up for the up-front payment?
I'm continuing to try to identify where we have differences in value so we
can discuss further tomorrow.  By the way, I think there will be 3 to 4 of
us tomorrow:

Myself
Tim Miller - Origination (Southwest)
Bill Burden - Business Development Gas and Power
Kim Colburn - Business Development Gas and Power

Give me a call and we can set up a place to meet in front of the restaurant
- they won't seat anyone until everyone is there anyway.

Penny

Penny,

We do not have a hard deadline for placing this capacity, however, some
of it has already been spoken for.   We could do something as early as
Nov 01 but I understand that may be a bit aggressive.  Our offer
currently stands at about $13MM for 100,000/day, Nov 01 - May 06.  We
will look to you to take on the obligation for that payment or make us a
counter offer.  We would be happy to sit down with you as early as next
week to work through any questions or issues.  I hope that answers your
question, please let me know if it doesn't.

Dave

PS - I'll be in Houston next week if a meeting would be useful.

Dave,

Just wanted to clarify what kind of deadline your aiming for with this
transport proposal.  The reason I am asking is I have taken this to the
next
level and we will probably need several days to run through our internal
processes.  I know you are working with multiple parties so if you let
me
know how you would like to proceed then we can be working on a similar
timeline. 

Thanks,  Penny

Dave, you also mentioned space on TW - do you have any more information
on
this?

Thanks, Penny

Hey Penny,

One more thought on the EPNG capacity valuation we've been discussing...
physical gas in the San Juan is selling at a discount to index,
therefore we are incorporating that into our valuation.  I thought you
might want to consider that as well. 

Thanks,
