After reviewing the list of issues to be addressed, it looks like we would want to keep an eye on this proceeding but I don't think we will need to take an active position. If you see anything that may directly impact the value of our capacity or access to our system through PG&E then let me know. Thanks.

The Commission issued its Scoping Memo today in the PG&E Gas Accord II  proceeding.  Attached is a memorandum that describes the significant  aspects of the ruling.  After you have had a chance to review it, we look  forward to discussing what role Transwestern may wish to take in this  proceeding.
