        Dear Reader,

        Demand drives the market.  This is a well-worn economic
        concept that propels companies and products into the
        marketplace as unique and innovative products and
        services meet the fervor of mass acceptance.  This is
        often the genesis of industry leaders and corporate
        giants as business plans are molded around a waiting
        and eager audience.

        Such is the case with Cryobanks International, which
        has agreed to by acquired by BioStem Inc., announcing
        this morning that it is expanding its global marketing
        push as a result of massive demand for its
        world-recognized cord blood technology.  In addition to
        the eight facilities presently under contract, the
        marketing & sales campaign will now encompass over 11
        countries with revenue projections exceeding $25M. (See

        Cryobanks provides taxes our in-house staff to the
        limit. Having local representation on the ground in
        each targeted country will help to identify and

        Athens, Greece and Delhi, India. Of the eight
        facilities under contract, the Bangkok, Thailand

                             [Image][Image]

        BioStem Inc. (OTCBB: BTEM), changed its name to BioStem
        in November 2005, the Board of Directors actively
        sought a merger with a privately held company in the
        cord blood banking business. On November 22, 2005,
        BioStem Inc. agreed to merge with Cryobanks
        International, Inc. Prior to this merger, BioStem had
        limited operations focused mainly on parking and
        parking related services. Upon closing of the merger,
        these subsidiaries will be divested from BTEM, and
        Cryobanks will be the only remaining entity.

        Cryobanks International, Inc., a pioneer in the
        collection, isolation, and storage technologies for
        cord blood stem cells. Cryobanks International Inc.
        (CII), located in Altamonte Springs Florida, is engaged
        in the collection, processing, and cryogenic cellular
        storage of umbilical cord blood stem cells from
        non-related donors, for personal or sibling use, and
        for research purposes.

        The company was founded in 1993 in Altamonte Sprgs,
        Florida, which is a suburb of Orlando, and has a
        growing inventory of over 9,700 CBUs for future use in
        transplants and medical research. Cryobanks
        International, initially formed as a semen bank and a
        clinical and andrology laboratory, expanded its scope
        of business into the field of cord blood banking in
        mid-1995. The company is focused on providing
        high-quality umbilical cord blood stem cell processing,
        and storage for both private family use and public
        donation purposes. Cryobanks International was
        incorporated as a Delaware corporation in May 1999 as
        an umbilical cord blood stem cell collecting,
        processing & storage enterprise, processing both
        personal and donated cord blood for use in
        transplantation & research.

        CII established the first and only nationwide system
        for donating cord blood. Since 1995, Cryobanks
        International, Inc. (CII) has been accepting and
        processing donated cord blood units from anywhere in
        the United States. It is the only facility accepting
        donated cord blood units from anywhere in the
        continental U.S., every day of the week 24 hours per
        day. Fully accredited by the American Association of
        Blood Banks (AABB) and a member of the National Marrow
        Donor Program® Cord Blood Bank Network (NMDP), CII
        processes donated units following the highest standards
        in the industry and is a licensed PharmaStem cord blood
        bank. Units that qualify are listed on international
        registries so that anyone in need of a potential
        life-saving stem cell transplant may find an acceptable
        match. Cryobanks is New York and New Jersey State
        licensed, and is FDA registered.

        The Closing of the merger between Cryobanks and Biostem
        is subject to certain contingencies more fully
        described in Current Form 8-K filed November 28, 2005
        with the SEC. According to the terms of the merger with
        Cryobanks, BioStem must restructure its capitalization
        by canceling certain shares held by former
        shareholders, and potentially effecting a reverse split
        of its common stock, and must reduce its debt to under
        $25,000 in accrued liabilities. In addition, Cryobanks
        must successfully raise at least $10,000,000 in a
        private placement offering. The offering was planned is
        for preferred stock at $1.00 per share with warrants to
        purchase 3,000,000 shares of Cryobanks common stock,
        exercisable at $1.10 per share. Upon closing of the
        merger, BTEM will divest its two operating
        subsidiaries, issue 120,000,000 shares of common stock
        or an approximately 88% majority to Cryobanks
        shareholders. Additional terms of the merger calls for
        the current management of BioStem to resign, and the
        Board of Cryobanks to assume control of the company.
        The closing date was recently extended and now
        specifies that the merger must be completed by June
        30th, 2007 or the letter of intent will expire. BioStem
        anticipates that the merger will be extended again to
        allow time for the $9.0 million financing to close,
        although there is no assurance that this will happen.

             [Image]The company is focused on four lines
             of business all related to collection and
             storage of cord blood stem cells:

<p><b>BioStem Inc. (OTCBB: BTEM)</b>, changed its name to BioStem in November
2005, the Board of Directors actively sought a merger with a privately
held company in the cord blood banking business. On November 22, 2005,
BioStem Inc. agreed to merge with Cryobanks International, Inc. Prior to
this merger, BioStem had limited operations focused mainly on parking and
parking related services. Upon closing of the merger, these subsidiaries
will be divested from BTEM, and Cryobanks will be the only remaining entity.
<p>Cryobanks International, Inc., a pioneer in the collection, isolation,
and storage technologies for cord blood stem cells. Cryobanks International
Inc. (CII), located in Altamonte Springs Florida, is engaged in the collection,
processing, and cryogenic cellular storage of umbilical cord blood stem
cells from non-related donors, for personal or sibling use, and for research
purposes.
<p>The company was founded in 1993 in Altamonte Sprgs, Florida, which is
a suburb of Orlando, and has a growing inventory of over 9,700 CBUs for
future use in transplants and medical research. Cryobanks International,
initially formed as a semen bank and a clinical and andrology laboratory,
expanded its scope of business into the field of cord blood banking in
mid-1995. The company is focused on providing high-quality umbilical cord
blood stem cell processing, and storage for both private family use and
public donation purposes. Cryobanks International was incorporated as a
Delaware corporation in May 1999 as an umbilical cord blood stem cell collecting,
processing &amp; storage enterprise, processing both personal and donated
cord blood for use in transplantation &amp; research.
<p>CII established the first and only nationwide system for donating cord
blood. Since 1995, Cryobanks International, Inc. (CII) has been accepting
and processing donated cord blood units from anywhere in the United States.
It is the only facility accepting donated cord blood units from anywhere
in the continental U.S., every day of the week 24 hours per day. Fully
accredited by the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) and a member
of the National Marrow Donor Program&reg; Cord Blood Bank Network (NMDP),
CII processes donated units following the highest standards in the industry
and is a licensed PharmaStem cord blood bank. Units that qualify are listed
on international registries so that anyone in need of a potential life-saving
stem cell transplant may find an acceptable match. Cryobanks is New York
and New Jersey State licensed, and is FDA registered.
<p>The Closing of the merger between Cryobanks and Biostem is subject to
certain contingencies more fully described in Current Form 8-K filed November
28, 2005 with the SEC. According to the terms of the merger with Cryobanks,
BioStem must restructure its capitalization by canceling certain shares
held by former shareholders, and potentially effecting a reverse split
of its common stock, and must reduce its debt to under $25,000 in accrued
liabilities. In addition, Cryobanks must successfully raise at least $10,000,000
in a private placement offering. The offering was planned is for preferred
stock at $1.00 per share with warrants to purchase 3,000,000 shares of
Cryobanks common stock, exercisable at $1.10 per share. Upon closing of
the merger, BTEM will divest its two operating subsidiaries, issue 120,000,000
shares of common stock or an approximately 88% majority to Cryobanks shareholders.
Additional terms of the merger calls for the current management of BioStem
to resign, and the Board of Cryobanks to assume control of the company.
The closing date was recently extended and now specifies that the merger
must be completed by June 30th, 2007 or the letter of intent will expire.
BioStem anticipates that the merger will be extended again to allow time
for the $9.0 million financing to close, although there is no assurance
that this will happen.
