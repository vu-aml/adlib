HAAS RANKS FOURTH AGAIN IN US NEWS UNDERGRADUATE RANKINGS
The Haas School of Business ranked fourth for the second year in a row in 
the 2001 US News & World Report survey of undergraduate business school 
programs published today, September 10. In fact, the six top schools earned 
the same ranks they did last year.

  The top ten programs and their scores (5.0 being the highest):

1. University of Pennsylvania (Wharton) 4.8
2. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Sloan) 4.6
2. University of Michigan-Ann Arbor 4.6
4. University of California-Berkeley (Haas) 4.5
5. University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (Kenan-Flagler) 4.3
5. University of Texas-Austin (McCombs) 4.3
7. Carnegie Mellon University  4.2
7. University of Virginia (McIntire) 4.2
9. Indiana University-Bloomington (Kelley) 4.1
9. New York University (Stern) 4.1
9. University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign 4.1

"Once again, we are extremely pleased that the Haas undergraduate program 
is ranked among the top 4 undergraduate business programs by US News & 
World Report along with such esteemed institutions as Wharton, MIT, and 
Michigan," said Dan Himelstein, director of the Haas undergraduate program.

There are 350 accredited schools that offer undergraduate degrees in 
business, 48% of which responded to this survey. US News asked deans and 
senior faculty to rate the quality of all programs they are familiar with 
on a scale of 1 (marginal) to 5 (distinguished).

"This top-four ranking of the Haas undergraduate program means that US News 
& World Report recently ranked three Haas degree programs in the top ten -- 
Undergraduate, MBA, and Evening MBA," said Andy Shogan, associate dean of 
academic programs. "This is a tribute to the overall excellence of the Haas 
School's students, faculty, staff." The MBA program ranked 7th and the 
Evening MBA program ranked 8th in March of 2001.

US News also ranked several school-wide specialties or particular strengths 
of business programs. Here is how the Haas School faired this year:

3rd in Marketing (4th in 2000)
4th in Finance (4th in 2000)
5th in Management (3rd in 2000)
5th in E-commerce (5th in 2000)
7th in Entrepreneurship (8th in 2000)
8th in International Business (6th in 2000)
9th in Accounting (not ranked in 2000)
9th in Production/Operations Management (not ranked in 2000)
11th in Management Information Technology (not ranked in 2000)
13th in Supply Chain Management/Logistics (not ranked in 2000)

Any school that offered any courses in a particular specialty was eligible 
to be ranked in that area. Deans and senior faculty of business schools 
nominated up to 10 of the best programs in each specialty area.

  THE SECOND OF SIX NEW FACULTY PROFILES: CHRIS HENNESSY JOINS FINANCE GROUP
Christopher Hennessy joined the Finance faculty this fall fresh from 
Princeton University where he received his Ph.D. and served as a lecturer 
in Fall 2000. His research interests include how businesses are financed 
and how that affects decision making.

In his dissertation Hennessy discussed the way in which the choice of 
financing for a business (debt, equity, convertible debt, or equity 
warrants) affects investment policy.  "I deal with two issues, the amount 
of investment and the riskiness of investment," says Hennessy.  Businesses 
with higher amounts of debt are found to lower investment levels, 
particularly when the debt level is heavy enough to push the firm into 
lower bond rating categories. "My advice to lenders: don't think people are 
bad; they are worse than you think."

Hennessy believes that understanding what determines the investment policy 
of businesses is essential to fostering economic growth.  "A major part of 
the reason why the US enjoys its high standard of living is that capital is 
plentiful," says Hennessy. "Capital remains plentiful despite high taxation 
of capital income in the US. I believe part of the reason is that the US 
has given investors superior protection in terms of stability of property 
rights and guarantees against managers running off with funds.  Russia 
offers a clear demonstration of what happens if you do not anticipate and 
protect against perverse managerial incentives."

In addition to his Ph.D. in economics, Hennessy has a Masters of Public 
Administration from Princeton University. His BA is from Swarthmore College 
in economics and political science.  Prior to pursuing his doctoral degree, 
he was a senior consultant in the Barents Group of KPMG Peat Marwick.

In spring 2002, Hennessy will teach Corporate Finance in the Masters of 
Financial Engineering Program and Corporate Finance in the Ph.D. Program. 
His office is located in F632, his phone number is 3-1900, and his e-mail 
is hennessy@haas.berkeley.edu.
