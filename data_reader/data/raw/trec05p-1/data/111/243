I spoke to Joe Ball last week and inquired of the status of our permit
app.  Joe had not heard anything from the legislature.  After I reminded
him that the legislature had a statutory maximum of 15 days to make any
recommendation, Joe stated that he had waited long enough and would
finalize the order and permit and submit it to the commissioner for
signature.  he indicated that we should have a signed order sometime
this week.  I'll keep you both posted.
