Quick question:

I was wondering if you know anyone who could benefit
from a better understanding of energy derivatives, risk 
 management policy, gas-to-electricity arbitrage, statistics or 
 electric power trading.  
 
 If you do, please make them aware of  PGS Energy Training's
upcoming seminars in downtown Houston (in February) and
downtown Philadelphia (March). 
 http://www.pgsenergy.com/schedule.html
 
Available seminars include:
    1) Fundamentals of Energy Futures, Options & Derivatives
    2) Fundamentals of the Electric Power Industry
    3) Gas-to-Electricity Arbitrage & How to Maximize the
        Profitability of Electric Generation Assets
    4) Developing Effective Risk Management Policies
        & Procedures (John Wengler)
    5) Fundamentals of Statistical Analysis (Dr. Ken Skinner)
    6) How to Value Electric Generation Assets as Real Options 
    7) Fundamentals of Value-at-Risk (Soli Forouzan)
 
For seminar dates and hotel information, call 412-279-9298 
or visit  http://www.pgsenergy.com/schedule.html
 
 You can also save money by bringing a group of 4 or more. 
 With a group rate, your cost for $1,295 seminars is reduced 
 to $895 per attendee-- a savings of $1,600 from regular 
 prices. The group price for the $695 programs is $495.
 
As you know, successful people invest the they time need to
improve their career prospects and increase their value to
their organization.  Hope to see you there!
