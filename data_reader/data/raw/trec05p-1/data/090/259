Latest NFL Player News

Mike Alstott, RB TB - Luccis Losers Updated 10/19/01
Don't expect much from Alstott this week. Warrick Dunn is healthy enough to
start again, and will be the featured back against Pittsburgh.

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 10/19/01
Don't expect huge numbers from Morton in Sunday's game against Tennessee.
He'll give your Fantasy team a slight boost if the Lions are forced to pass
if they fall behind early, but we recommend you only use Morton if you're
thin at wide receiver.

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/19/01
Stewart will have a hard time racking up good Fantasy stats Sunday against
a Tennessee linebacking corps that can cover a lot of ground. Start him
only if you don't have two other backs on your team with better matchups.

Byron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 10/19/01
Chamberlain is definitely a good start this week. He will become a major
factor if the Packers focus too much on Minnesota's wide receivers.

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/19/01
Booker would make an excellent Fantasy starter in his game Sunday against
the Bengals. Cincinnati is without cornerback Rodney Heath, which will make
it difficult to defend Booker this week.

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/19/01
Expect good numbers from Carter this week. He is a big-game player who will
not be flustered by the improved Green Bay defense.

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/19/01
Robinson battled a back injury in Week Five, but he should rebound on
Sunday against Cincinnati. The Bears will need to make some deep passes and
we think Robinson would make a solid Fantasy starter this week.

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Green Bay's defense has played well so far, but Culpepper won't be
intimidated by the Packers. He has faced them many times before, and should
fare well in an important divisional game in front of the home crowd.

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Miller will need to throw the deep ball often Sunday against the
overaggressive Bengals. He should post adequate Fantasy numbers, making him
a solid starter if you don't have any other superstar QBs to choose from.

Ahman Green, RB GB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/19/01
Green will get the bulk of his numbers in the second half if Green Bay can
get ahead of Minnesota early. He will definitely be good for at least one
TD.

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/19/01
Favre should have another excellent game this week. Minnesota's secondary
will not be able to handle him, especially with CB Robert Tate ailing.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/19/01
Dunn sat out practice Thursday with a sprained right big toe, but is
expected to play Sunday against Pittsburgh. He faces a tough challenge in
the Steelers' stingy rush defense, so consider reserving him if you have a
more established back on your roster.

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Schroeder missed practice for a second straight day Thursday due to an
ankle injury. However, he is listed as probable on the injury report, and
you should probably start him this week unless he takes a turn for the
worse before gametime.

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/19/01
Moss practiced Thursday for the first time since aggravating an ankle
injury on Sunday, and has been upgraded from questionable to probable on
the injury report for Sunday's game against Green Bay. You should
definitely get him into your active Fantasy lineup as a result.

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Matthews could serve as the backup quarterback for the Bears Sunday in
Cincinnati after throwing in drills Thursday. Don't bother with him, as
he's not going to get much playing time the rest of the season behind Jim
Miller on the depth chart.

Fred Baxter, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Baxter practiced Thursday and hopes to be able to play Sunday in
Cincinnati, according to the <I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>. He has been
recovering from a neck injury, but isn't worth your Fantasy attention.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/19/01
Griese (shoulder) practiced with the first-team offense, and looked good,
Mike Shanahan told the <I>Denver Post</i>. He is expected to start against
San Diego. "I think he did pretty good," coach Mike Shanahan said. "He
practiced the whole practice. It didn't look like there was anything wrong.
I'm not sure how painful it is because I haven't talked to him, but so far,
so good." 

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Wilkins (ribs) is not expected to play against the Patriots. He is listed
as doubtful.

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/19/01
The effects of a concussion suffered against Miami has kept Chrebet out of
practices this week. He is expected to play against St. Louis.

J.R. Redmond, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/19/01
Redmond (ankle) is expected to be in uniform for Sunday's game. But it
appears he will not be used much, because New England has found Antowain
Smith to be a dependable back.

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Clark should get open often against San Diego. The Chargers' pass defense
can definitely be exploited over the middle.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 10/19/01
Smith should have another fine game this week. He will be the focal point
of the Denver passing game in a contest that will feature a lot of offense.

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/19/01
Anderson may find it difficult to reach 100 yards against the Chargers. San
Diego has a strong front seven, and the Broncos are having trouble with
blocking on end runs.

Freddie Jones, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Jones has been a disappointment so far, but he could be a factor this week,
as the Chargers trade blows with the Broncos in a high-scoring game.

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 10/19/01
Graham should produce good numbers this week. The Chargers will probably
engage in a high-scoring game with the Broncos.

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Gonzalez will be a prime target against the Cardinals. Kansas City will
certainly see many passing openings over the middle. 

Chris Thomas, WR KC - Uran Man Updated 10/19/01
Thomas has moved into Kansas City's starting lineup. Don't use him unless
you are desperate for help at receiver.

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/19/01
The matchup suggests Alexander will do well this week, but the Chiefs will
probably look to keep the ball on the ground, limiting Kansas City's
passing numbers.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Don't expect Wycheck to catch a lot of passes this weekend. He hasn't been
featured too heavily in the Titans' passing game and has been used more to
block for running back Eddie George. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/19/01
Mason is suffering from an ankle injury and is listed as questionable for
this week's game against the Lions. Tennessee expects him to play but don't
rely on him being too productive. The injury caused him to miss last week's
game. 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/19/01
Look for Bettis to gain some yards this week, despite the presence of an
imposing Buccaneers defense. He should even reach the end zone. Bettis is
overdue for a touchdown. He had eight rushing TDs last year but has none
this season. 

Kordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 10/19/01
Stewart will have limited success trying to advance the ball this week.
Don't expect him to throw any TD passes. He has just one so far this
season. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/19/01
Ward will struggle to catch passes against a formidable Buccaneers defense
this week. Tampa has one of the best pass defenses in the NFL. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Look for Burress to catch a few passes this week but don't expect him to
score. Burress has not caught a TD pass in four games. He is a third
receiver at best. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/19/01
Holmes should have another big game this week. Arizona's run defense is one
of the worst in football, and Holmes will take complete advantage of the
matchup.

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/19/01
Don't expect Jackson to gain a lot of yards this week against a tough
Baltimore defense. The Ravens have not allowed a running back to run for
over 100 yards against them in over a year. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/19/01
According to published reports, Faulk will now definitely miss Sunday's
game against the New York Jets. Faulk missed his third straight practice on
Friday, so the team will go with Trung Canidate as the featured back. 

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 10/19/01
Couch probably won't complete a high percentage of his passes but should
throw at least one TD pass. Consider benching him this week if you have a
QB on your roster that has a more favorable matchup. 

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Johnson played well against the Bengals last week. Look for him to continue
to produce against the Ravens this Sunday. Baltimore looked vulnerable
against the pass last week. Johnson probably won't be as successful as he
was against the Bengals but will be an adequate No. 2 receiver. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/19/01
Dillon will struggle to gain yards against the Bears, who have one of the
top run defenses in the NFL. Don't expect him to get a rushing TD. The
Bears have only allowed one TD run this season. 

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 10/19/01
Kitna will have problems accumulating passing yards against the Bears but
should throw at least one TD pass. He has thrown at least one TD pass in
every game this season. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/19/01
Warrick is recovering from a bruised shoulder but is expected to play in
Sunday's game against the Bears. Look for Warrick to catch a few passes,
but it will be hard for him to get into the end zone. Warrick has struggled
scoring points and has just one TD reception. 

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/19/01
Scott will have problems producing against a stout Bears defense. He only
has seven receptions in his past three games. Scott is a No. 3 receiver at
best. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/19/01
Expect Sharpe to have another solid week, as far as tight ends are
concerned. He is the team's leader in receptions and should get a
reasonable amount of balls thrown his way. Don't be surprised if he scores
a touchdown as well. Sharpe is overdue for a score. He had five TD catches
in 2000 but hasn't scored one this season. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/19/01
Allen should gain some yards this week against a stout Browns defense, but
don't expect him to get any rushing TDs. He only has two rushing TDs this
season. Nevertheless, Allen will be a solid No. 2 back this week. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/19/01
Grbac has been mediocre this season, throwing six TD passes in five games.
Now he will face Cleveland this week and the Browns have one of the best
past defenses. Don't be surprised if Grbac struggles. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Glenn injured his hamstring in practice on Thursday. He may miss Sunday's
game, forcing David Patten back into New England's starting lineup and
making Troy Brown the No. 1 wideout again.

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/19/01
Muhammad (ribs) returned to practice on Thursday and is expected to start
on Sunday against Washington. Considering the state of the Redskins'
defense, we'd suggest starting Muhammad despite his injury. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/19/01
Weinke missed a portion of practice on Thursday due to a thigh bruise.
However, Head Coach Geroge Seifert expects his rookie quarterback to start
on Sunday against Washington. The matchup against the 'Skins is a good one
for Weinke, who should receive starting consideration from Fantasy owners. 

Rob Moore, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Moore (hamstring) missed practice on Thursday and has been downgraded for
Sunday's game against New Orleans. He'll likely miss yet another week of
action, so keep him on reserve if he's currently on your roster. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/19/01
McNair is listed as questionable (shoulder) for Sunday's game against the
Lions but is expected to play. Look for him to score a touchdown by either
running the ball in or throwing. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/19/01
George is listed as questionable on the injury report with an ankle injury
but is expected to play Sunday against Detroit. Look for George to have a
big game against the struggling Lions. 

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Look for Taylor to catch several passes this week and snag at least one
touchdown pass. He has become one of Elvis Grbac's favorite targets inside
the red zone. 

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/19/01
Ismail will catch a few passes this week but don't expect him to score any
touchdowns. He has just two TD receptions in five games. 

Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Northcutt has been getting a lot of practice in the No. 2 receiver slot and
might fill-in for the injured Quincy Morgan as a starter. Don't expect
Northcutt to be too productive, but he is a decent pickup if you need an
extra wideout. 

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/18/01
The Chiefs might depend on the run, so Green's numbers may be limited.
Expect one TD pass, but his yardage numbers will be modest.

Ken Dilger, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore.
Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this
week.

Marcus Pollard, TE IND - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once
again be a key factor in the passing game against New England this week,

Edgerrin James, RB IND - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New
England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this
week.

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/18/01
Wayne is expected to start in place of the injured Jerome Pathon for the
second consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in
your Fantasy lineup.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned
Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against
New England.

Peyton Manning, QB IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/18/01
Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was
intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against
them at home this week.

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/18/01
Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle.
He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green
Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether
he will be able to play.

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving
treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding
whether to use him this week.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might
have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff
didn't hurt him last week.

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts
this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in
his second meeting with Indianapolis.

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a good
week if the Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky
start, because New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down
by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his
downfield speed.

Curtis Martin, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Jets
will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but
he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible
offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting
Davis this week warrants consideration. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18
passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't
even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a
decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers
in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues. 

Vinny Testaverde, QB NYJ - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can
be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first
interception of the year.

Walter Rasby, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight end now that Stephen
Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at
this point. 

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary
on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in
larger leagues. 

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets
secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your
starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to
ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the
questionable N.Y. Jets secondary. 

Ernie Conwell, TE STL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this
season. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more
reliable tight end on your roster. 

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/18/01
Canidate will replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this
weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense
and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/18/01
Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a
a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York
Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup. 

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the
majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid
will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the
more productive of the two backs. 

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth
starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and
around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup. 

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/18/01
Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this
season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit
suspect at this point. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
The <i>Contra-Costa Times</i> says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial
collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley
will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for
Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.

Chad Lewis, TE PHI - Blue Balls Updated 10/18/01
Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on
Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and
should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
Thrash has been somewhat of a bust thus far, and isn't worth starting on a
consistent basis Fantasy-wise. As a result, don't play the Eagles' wideout
unless he proves that he can be more reliable. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/18/01
Dayne has emerged as New York's main threat in the backfield, and has been
relatively productive in the role. Even with Tiki Barber back in the mix,
we expect Dayne to get the majority of the carries in the game. He'll have
a tough time running on the Eagles' defense, however, be he's still worth
starting in deeper Fantasy leagues. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/18/01
Barber (hamstring) is listed as probable for Monday's game against
Philadelphia. He'll be used in the same capacity he was prior to the
injury, splitting time with Ron Dayne. We'd avoid using Barber if possible
as a result, especially in smaller leagues. 

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/18/01
Richardson (shoulder) has returned to practice, and is expected to play
against Arizona. He might take away some carries from Priest Holmes, but
Holmes has clearly become Kansas City's top ground option.

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/18/01
Collins has been mediocre at best this season, but his numbers against
Philadelphia were respectable in 2000. He's not the best option
Fantasy-wise, but you could do worse if you're desperate for a quarterback. 

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Minnis has been replaced in Kansas City's starting lineup by Chris Thomas.
The rookie wideout has been having trouble with his route running and
communication with QB Trent Green.

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/18/01
Hilliard will continue his role as the Giants' third receiver on Monday
against Philadelphia. His decreased playing time makes it tough to
recommend starting him, but don't be surprised if Hilliard finds the end
zone against the Eagles. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Toomer will face a tough matchup on Monday night, facing CB Bobby Taylor
and the aggressive Philadelphia secondary. He's worth starting in deeper
leagues, however, but you may want to sit him should you have the advantage
of a deep group of wideouts. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Williams is silencing his critics this season and has established himself
as a top Fantasy back. He's a must-start every week Fantasy-wise,
especially against lesser defenses like Atlanta. 

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
This could be the week that Brooks breaks out of his semi-slump. Brooks
will be facing an Atlanta defense that is dead last in the league against
the pass, so the matchup is certainly in his favor. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
Pathon (foot) did not practice on Wednesday. He is not expected to play
against New England, and Reggie Wayne will probably start in his place for
the second consecutive week. He may not return until Nov. 4.

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
Horn is a must-start this weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons' secondary
is very vulnerable, so Horn should have no trouble putting up solid Fantasy
numbers. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 10/18/01
Jackson had a down week against Carolina, but don't be surprised to see him
bounce back against Atlanta. The Falcons' secondary is one of the league's
worst, and is easily vulnerable to a big game. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Biakabutuka will be Carolina's starting tailback this weekend against
Washington. Based on the matchup, Biakabutuka is well worth starting
Fantasy-wise against a horrible Redskins' run defense. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 10/18/01
If Muhsin Muhammad is still being hindered by his rib injury, Hayes could
be in line for a big game against Washington. In any event, Hayes is worth
starting in deeper leagues based on the matchup.
