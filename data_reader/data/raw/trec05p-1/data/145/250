This is from Reliant's Cheif Risk Officer.  Please speak with Presto about facilitating these trades.  Also, Badeer was trying to ring positions out with MS and AEP and I told him not to do anything with AEP.

We have had generally good success working with your traders and credit departments working on mutually beneficial 3-way offset transactions. Much appreciated. Even today in the west. But I don't think your pjm or ercot traders agree with the worthiness of that type of activity. Pjm trader will not participate without a spread and ercot trader won't even discuss. We are not panicked here but trying to make credit room for continued trading activity makes sense for us all. I have informed our traders to be o
pen to such opportunities, but not to actively seek them out because of the confidentiality provisions in our contracts. That's why the interaction of your traders is vital. There are two pending opportunities in pjm and ercot. Hope you can help.

I also just got a writeup of a potential new 4-year deal in the west our guys are negotiating with your EES supply desk. I am reviewing now. Of course it only adds to our mutual credit exposure, so making room in other areas makes so much sense.
