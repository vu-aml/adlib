Day1 requirements - RisktRAC operations

1) User List 
Need to gather list of all employees that will be using risktRAC for book administration, verify list, then ensure they are setup in the RisktRAC database.
(related to 3) Security Access).

2) Migrate users to Netco
Need to check with network security and/or integration team to find out when the users IDs will be
converted to run on the Netco network.  (Dependency for running RisktRAC on Netco).

3) Security Access
Work with Stephanie to follow up with Security on approval for RisktRAC application: confirm groups and approvers.  	Ensure everyone who does not have RisktRAC will have an e-request submitted.

4) RisktRAC Training
Once users have access to Netco RisktRAC setup timeframe for basic training.  If time permits a hands-on overview could also be arranged, as long as someone can access the Netco RisktRAC from their desk (either user or developer).

5) Website connectivity: 
Distribute RAC website URL to Netco employees 
(confirmed with Bhupesh - http://rac.netco.enron.com )

6) Disable Spreadsheet Position loading: 
In RisktRAC disable the ability to load exotic spreadsheets for Day1 users.

7) Day1 Portfolio Hierarchy
(This step can occur before the books are loaded into RisktRAC.)

Review with Frank Hayden the ideal portfolio hierarchy that should be setup, then have users start building the structure without any associations to real portfolios.
The book-portfolio tie-in will occur with action item 8) Day1 Book-setup Spreadsheet.

8) Day1 Book-setup Spreadsheet
a) Discuss timeline for loading Day1 book data from the book-setup spreadsheet;
    Discuss validation issues and cutoff for loading data.
    Note expected book counts are 164 for Gas and approximately 55 - 60 for Power.

b) Add two columns in the spreadsheet for portfolio creation and hierarchy placement, have users fill in this data with guidance from IT.

9)  Control RisktRAC screen-access
Discuss necessary business groups and screen-access to setup in RisktRAC:  Gas Users, Power Users, Credit Users, Market-Risk Users, any other groups that come to mind.

10)  Book-creation/Portfolio audit:
Develop simple adhoc report to help audit books that are not associated with portfolios.  Discuss validation specifications with Ramesh.

11) Financial checks and balances:  
How can reported position/P&L numbers match up with those reported by accounting?  Need to find out who owns the accounting reporting and see if some adhoc verification can be implemented.


Known RisktRAC requirements beyond Day1

1) Desktop RisktRAC portfolio security 
Review how to implement portfolio-level security in the RisktRAC that is already present on the RAC website.

2) Benchmark Server:
Review with infrastructure how to migrate a copy of the Benchmark Server to a Netco server. 
Debbie and Ramesh to discuss further.
