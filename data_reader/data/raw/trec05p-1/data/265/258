Dear friend, 

With warm heart I offer my friendship and greetings and I hope this letter meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have Not met personally or had any
dealings in the past, I Humbly ask that you take due consideration of its Importance and the immense benefit it will be to you. 

After careful consideration with my Son, we resolved to contact you for your most needed assistance in this manner. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as
I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. For the purpose of introduction, I am Mrs Bintu Omar the wife of late Brigadier Barham Omar from Zimbabwe currently hiding in South Africa as refugees. My
husband severed in the ZANU PF Government lead by Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe. 

He operated in Mozambique, Angola, and Congo formerly Zaire lead by Mubutu Seseseko, during this period He was used as a confidante's by Robert Mugabe and his hierarchy to carry out their shady deals of smuggling Diamonds and gold from mines which were situated in areas controlled by Zimbabwean soldiers. 

During this period he managed to accumulate a personal fortune of US$10,000,000 (TEN Million United States Dollars) which he secretly Lodged with a security and finance company here in South Africa as
'precious Stones" because of the fear of my country president Robert Mugabe 

Before the 2002 presidential election in Zimbabwe my husband defected to the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) because he defied an order to send a contingent of his battalion to go and attack
innocent white farmers for refusing to give up their land, as a result of that and because of the position my husband held and the secret duties that he executed for ZANU PF he was put under surveillance by
the central intelligence organisation and Mugabe's secret police. He was caught and thrown into the prison and later he was killed by Robert Mugabe and is partners Before his death, he managed to smuggle
out a letter to me intimating me about the existence of the sum, which he deposited with the security and finance company in South Africa, which he acquired during his operations for president Robert Mugabe and
ZANU PF Because of the strong relationship existing between the current South Africa Government and Zimbabwean Government it is increasingly becoming too risky for me and my Son to remain in South Africa. As a result of this I am seeking your assistance to help us (me and my son) clear this fund and deposit it in your personal account in your country for our investment..


For your assistance (I and my Son) is prepared to give you 15% of the total sum as compensation, and 5% is set aside to settle any expenses that we might incur during the cause of clearing and transferring this fund to your nominated account, while the remaining 80% will be for us (I and my Son), for our investment in your company, under your supervision and with you as our fund manager. 

What I need from you is as follows:- 

a)Your honesty that you will not run away with our money. 
b) Your contacts details such as Fax /Telephone and mobile numbers for easy communication. 

For more information regarding this transaction, I would appreciate if you contact my son (Ahmed Omar) through his phone number +27-83 8686 990 or email:(barhamomar@hotmail.com) Immediately you receive this letter for more briefings and details. 

Your urgent response is highly needed. 

Best regards, 
 MRS BINTU OMAR 
(for the family)
