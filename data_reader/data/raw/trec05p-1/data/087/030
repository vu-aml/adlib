InformationWeek Magazine recognizes your company as a leader in the use of
information technology and collaborative practices. That's why we're inviting
you to participate in InformationWeek's Innovators in Collaboration, a study
that will spotlight 25 businesses that are setting the standard for business
collaboration.

To be considered, four short essays on your organization's collaborative
strategies must be completed and received by Nov. 2.  To review the study
questions and submit your essays, visit
http://www.informationweek.com/collaboration/form.htm.

InformationWeek editors will review and evaluate all submissions and this year's
InformationWeek Innovation 25 will be featured in the Dec. 10 issue.

We look forward to your participation.  Please don't hesitate to contact me at
cjmurphy@cmp.com with any questions.

Sincerely,

Chris Murphy
