Statement in response to decision in IMS v. Ayotte,

NH District Court, No. CV-06-280-PB (April 30, 2007)

Sean Flynn

Associate Director, Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property

May 1, 2007



Yesterday, a New Hampshire District Judge stated that our constitution prevents New Hampshire from implementing the same common sense data privacy laws that restrict the trade in prescription records as currently exist in all of Europe and several Canadian provinces.  Those laws prohibit datamining companies from selling information to pharmaceutical companies that contain doctors' names and other identifying information.  Instead, the companies can only compile and use information in aggregated "blocks" so as to protect the identity of specific doctors and their prescribing habits.



Judge Barbadoro's opinion striking down New Hampshire's ban on the trading of prescriber-identified data is sweeping and disturbing in many respects.  The decision sweeps far beyond established First Amendment precedent and is sure to be appealed by the State of New Hampshire.  The decision does contain some reasoning that can be of guidance to states seeking policy solutions to the excesses of detailing and datamining in the pharmaceutical industry.  On the whole, however, the opinion is unwelcome news to states and health care policy advocates.



The New Hampshire Act was passed against the background of evidence showing that nearly a third of the five-fold increase in U.S. spending on drugs over the last decade can be attributed to the increased efficacy of pharmaceutical marketing efforts that shift doctors' prescribing from existing, effective, and lower cost (often generic) therapies to new and more expensive treatments, which often have little or no increased therapeutic value.  One key change has been the recent ability of large datamining companies to purchase computerized prescription records from insurers and pharmacies and then sell that information to pharmaceutical companies to track every prescription a doctor writes.  Coincident with the rise of physician identity data mining, the pharmaceutical industry increased its spending on direct marketing to doctors by over 275 percent  and doubled its sales force to over 90,000 drug reps.   There is now a pharmaceutical sales representative for every five office-based physicians in the U.S.   In 2004, the industry spent $27 billion on drug marketing (more than any other sector in the U.S. on its sales force or media advertising),  over 85 percent of which was targeted at doctors.



Judge Baradoro begins his reasoning with a rejection of New Hampshire's argument that the Prescription Information Law does not restrict speech because it regulates "uses" (i.e. sale and trade in) of prescriber-identifiable information, rather than First Amendment protected speech.  He specifically rejected New Hampshire's comparison of the law with the Act upheld by the Supreme Court in Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514 (2001).



In Bartnicki, the Court struck down a section of the statute that constituted a "naked prohibition against disclosures" of information obtained through a wiretap, but approved of the section of the law that penalized any person who "uses . . . the contents of" a wiretapped communication.   The court recognized cases holding that the use prohibition made it unlawful to "use an illegally intercepted communication . . . to create a competing product," "in trading in securities," "to prepare strategy for contract negotiations," or "to discipline a subordinate."   These prohibitions did not implicate the First Amendment, the Court explained, because "the prohibition against the 'use' of the contents of an illegal intraception" is "a regulation of conduct."



Like the Act in Barnicki, the New Hampshire act allows a broad range of disclosures of prescription information for non-commercial uses, but bans the trade of such information for marketing and other commercial purposes.  But the judge rejected this distinction, holding that "The law is [  ] a speech restriction because it limits both the use and disclosure of prescriber-identifiable data for commercial purposes."



The court further held that the Act would subject to First Amendment scrutiny even it was a restriction on conduct because it "restricts speech by preventing pharmaceutical companies from using prescriber-identifiable information both to identify a specific audience for their marketing efforts and to refine their marketing messages.  Such laws are subject to First Amendment interests of their pharmaceutical company customers."



            Importantly, the court did hold that the act was a commercial regulation subject to the commercial speech doctrine, rather than the strict standard applied to political and other non-commercial speech.  It explained:



In understanding why this is so, it is important to bear in mind that the challenged law only restricts the transmission or use of prescriber-identifiable information for certain commercial purposes. It does not prevent anyone from transmitting or using the information for law enforcement purposes, research purposes, educational purposes, compliance review purposes, or for any non-commercial purpose. In short, the law is a commercial speech restriction under Central Hudson because it restricts only speech that is "solely in the individual interest of the speaker and its specific business audience," Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U.S. 749, 762 (1985) (plurality opinion).



            Other courts, including the courts in U.S. West, Inc. v. Fed.

Commc'n Comm'n, 182 F.3d 1224, 1232 (10th Cir. 1999) and Trans Union Corp. v. Fed. Trade Comm'n, 245 F.3d 809, 818 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (applying intermediate scrutiny to ban on sale of targeted marketing lists), have held that regulations restricting use of customer information for marketing purposes regulate speech protected by the First Amendment.  But the New Hampshire District Court went far beyond the holdings of these cases by striking down the act as being based on an insufficient government interest in protecting data privacy rather than on the existence of other more narrowly tailored means to address the interest. Those previous cases explicitly affirmed opt in or opt out programs that require a company to abide by the wishes of consumers in trading their identifying data.  The New Hampshire court did not leave this same policy avenue open in its opinion because it held that New Hamshire lacks a sufficient interest to even legislate in this area.  This aspect of the opinion is extremely broad and is likely to be subject to a vigorous appeal.



            The so-called commercial speech doctrine requires that truthful commercial speech that does not promote unlawful activity can be limited only if it (1) is in support of a substantial government interest, (2) 'directly advances the government interest asserted,' and (3) 'is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.



            The Court first explained that it found an insufficient record supporting the Act.  It stated:



There is nothing in the record, however, to support a conclusion that the legislature had established expertise in the regulation of prescriber-identifiable data. Moreover, it acted quickly after the bill was introduced, received hearing testimony by numerous individuals who had yet to review proposed amendments, made no express findings either on the record or incorporated into the statute, failed to discuss alternative measures that

would not restrict speech, and cited no evidence as to how effective the restriction might prove to be.



            It then rejected the government's professed interest in protecting the privacy interests of doctors in their records.  Distinguishing away a host of laws that protect consumer's privacy in their identity to avoid unwanted and harassing sales calls, e.g. Health

Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-191, 110 Stat. 1936 (codified in scattered sections of 18 U.S.C., 26 U.S.C., 29 U.S.C., and 42 U.S.C.) (patient medical information); Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq.(2000) (credit reporting information); Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, 20 U.S.C. § 1232g (2000 & Supp. III 2003) (educational information); Video Privacy Protection Act

of 1988, 18 U.S.C. 2710 (2000) (video rental information); Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-549, 98 Stat. 2779 (subscriber information), the court held that doctors do not have a similar valid interest in avoiding the harassing sales calls of detailers that are augmented by the trade of their prescribing patterns to pharmaceutical companies.  The court specifically mentioned the lack of evidence offered at trial proving that the information is "pressed with such frequency or vehemence as to intimidate, vex, or harass the recipient," Edenfield, 507 U.S. at 769.



            This finding by the court is particularly disturbing and far reaching.  In other instances noted above, legislatures and courts have found valid interests of consumers in having their identity and purchasing habits kept private without their consent to avoid harassing sales tactics.  Yet with medicines, the doctor is the one making the consuming choices - the doctor literally "prescribes" the medicine that the ultimate consumer purchases.  Thus it is the doctor who is the target of over 80% of the nearly $30 billion spent on pharmaceutical marketing every year.  This appears to be an area where a fuller record by state legislatures could help build a better factual background for subsequent legislation.



            The judge further found that the law does not directly control health costs and promote public health because, despite evidence showing that billions of dollars every year are spend on needless drug shifting toward more expensive brand name drugs driven by marketing, not all marketing driven shifts are bad and the "ban on the use of prescriber-identifiable data affects both helpful and harmful brand-name prescribing practices in the same way." The court held:



Accordingly, the State simply does not have a substantial interest in shielding them from sales techniques that enhance the effectiveness of truthful and non-misleading marketing information. Instead, if the State is concerned that truthful detailing is causing health care providers to make inadvisable prescribing decisions, "the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence." Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 377 (1927) (Brandeis, J. concurring).



            Finally, the court found that there are other effective measures to regulate the ill effects of detailing.  Specifically, the court stated that



if legislators are concerned that pharmaceutical companies are improperly using samples, gifts, meals, and other inducements to promote inadvisable prescribing practices, they can address this perceived problem by following other states that have adopted laws that limit such practices. See, e.g., Minn. Stat. Ann. § 151.461 (2007); Cal. Health and Safety Code § 119402(d)(1) (2007). Second, if legislators fear that pharmaceutical detailing is simply too effective to go unrebutted, they can require the State to enter the intellectual marketplace in several different ways with competing information that will help health care providers balance and place in context the sales messages that detailers deliver. . . . see, e.g., W. Va. Code Ann. § 5-16C-9(5) (2006) (authorizing state to develop counter-detailing programs); or they can require health care providers to regularly participate in continuing medical education programs that are specifically designed to provide practitioners with the best available information concerning the advantages and disadvantages of prescribing generic drugs rather than brand-name drugs. Finally, if legislators are concerned that pharmaceutical companies are using prescriber-identifiable data to drive up Medicaid drug costs, they can address the issue directly by properly implementing a Medicaid Pharmacy Program (preferred drug list) that takes into account the cost-effectiveness of brand-name drugs when compared with non-bioequivalent generic alternatives.



            At bottom, the opinion suggests several steps that states interested in regulating the ill effects of detailing might pursue:



*           states interested in regulating the trade in prescriber-identified prescription information need to create a fuller record explaining how frequently detailing based on datamining has become harassing to doctors in ways that prohibiting datamining without their consent will halt;

*           states may consider more narrowly tailored mans to stop data trading, for example permitting the information to be released to pharmaceutical companies if the doctor has explicitly consented to the release;

*           states should include specific findings on the adequacy of alternative measures, including licensing detailers, prohibiting false and misleading detailing, use of Medicaid formularies, bans on gifts, and counter-detailing programs;

*           states may consider bolstering an expectation of privacy in prescription records by including statutory findings and inviting testimony that doctors do not and should not expect that their prescriptions will be used for purposes other than to fill and process prescriptions;

*           target the most harmful and biased uses of datamining, e.g. by allowing their use for evidence-based marketing, but not use for marketing information that isn't supported by independent studies & sources (this may make the statute closer to the Barnicki "use" regulation);

*           states may consider alternative regulations, such as licensing and regulating detailers to cut down on the most abusive practices including gifts, pushing off-label uses, making misleading statements, etc.



Ultimately, the New Hampshire decision only binds New Hampshire and is likely to be headed for appeal.  Other states may legislate in this area and create conflicting precedents that will have to be unified by the First Circuit and ultimately the Supreme Court.
