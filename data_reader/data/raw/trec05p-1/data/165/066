I will not be in the office today (on my schedule) due to doctor appointments for my children.  I will be available on Thursday to discuss.  I have been coordinating with Gregg Penman, Richard Tomaski, Hunter Shively, Jeff Hodge, Lou Stoler, etc. and will set a meeting for Thursday to discuss how to proceed regarding PEC.  My assistant will coordinate the meeting.  I do not want this contract/s discussed in a large group due to the confidential nature and the protection of the ongoing Chicago business.  Don, I need someone to provide Irena with the name of a bankruptcy attorney who can attend.
 
I appreciate your understanding on this matter.
 
Laura

Please plan to attend a gas contract review kick-off meeting this morning (12/12/01) at 10:00 AM (location TBA).  You have been selected to review one or more physical gas contracts in an effort to expidite preservation of value in these agreements for ENA.
