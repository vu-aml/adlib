Janie - Leslie sent me a copy of your message indicating that you need to know about items that would be considered at the FERC meetings.  Until we get the data base set up and populated, and get a link for y'all on the Fundamentals web site, you can access the Agenda for each meeting at this FERC web site one week before the date of the meeting:  <http://www.ferc.gov/public/isd/sunshine.htm> 

Meetings are generally held on the second and fourth Wednesday of every month, except for August.  Occasionally, a meeting will be scheduled on another day instead.  The dates for the 2001 meetings are at this web site:  <http://www.ferc.gov/calendar/commissionmeetings/cmeet2001.htm>

The consent agendas are listed first by type (Markets, Rates and Tariffs - Electric; Markets, Rates and Tariffs - Gas; Hydro Projects; Certificates; etc.).  Any discussion items are listed at the end.
