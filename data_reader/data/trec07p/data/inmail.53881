The South Centre is holding a side event at the WIPO PCDA titled "Do
higher Standards of Patent Protection under TRIPS Generate a Positive
Impact on the Pharmaceutical Industry in developing Countries?” The South
Centre panel will discuss this critical question based on the findings of
a comparative study between China and India. The study is particularly
relevant given that China introduced product patent protection on
pharmaceuticals as early as of 1993 while India maintained process patent
protection until 2005.
