Mr. Campbell,
Don't be surprised at anything you see me pulling together like this.  The longer we are together, you will see that there is usually a reason to what may seem like madness' at the time.  We will look for those "win-win" situations that can bring Sun Devil into the light as a great environmental project as well as a solid economic growth effort which promotes sustainable development.  I am envisioning an initiative with youth in the greater Phoenix area that we can tie to Sun Devil.  Hang on the ride of your life.  More to follow.  John

Carole, 

Enron Transportation Services (ETS) has recently met with RMEF to discuss being involved with their elk conservation program.  We are moving ahead with plans to be associated with RMEF in the near future.  (ETS is a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp, headquartered in Houston, Texas.  ETS operates several major natural gas pipelines throughout the United States.)  

During the meeting, a copy of the current edition of the Bugle was given to us.  I read the article  "High Schools for Habitat - A "Monster" in the Making" and felt like this might be an excellent concept for our company to support.  The article is great and I especially liked your quote "What better way to pass it on than to raise a generation of citizen conservationists and pass on that spirit and that love of wildlife."   I believe we all want be involved with something beyond a "one time shot" that has a lasting effect into the future.  With this in mind, I would like the opportunity to explore ideas with you on how ETS might partner or form relationships with schools that would yield continuing future rewards.  I know you must have a very busy schedule, so please do not feel this requires an immediate response.

I can be reached by return email, or you can reach me at 713-646-7425. 

Thank you for your time and I commend you again on your article. 

Bob Adams
