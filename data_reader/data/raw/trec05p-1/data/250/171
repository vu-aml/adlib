Mark,

No, we do not have a copy of the letter.  The file room may have this letter or Stephanie Panus in her files.

Please advise.

Zakiyyah -

I think I know the answer to this question, but here goes anyway:  I have started my review of the deal.  In the termination letter, Otter Trail references a letter from OT to EPMI dated 11/30/01 and discusses a possible reservation of rights based on that letter.  Do you have a copy of that letter?  If so, please forward.

Thanks.

Mark
