Let's meet sometime this morning (if you are in) and allow me to catch you up on an a/r discussion that I had with Dave Neubauer last week regarding the clean up of our older receivables.  I will be meeting with Lynn from 9:00 - 10:00 so possibly we can meet right after that.  We'll give stop by and let you know.

Lynn/Rick, Frank sent this to me last week and I have been working on it but I have one item for $1,406.01 that was listed on a report that Frank had that I can't seem to find on the A/R - maybe Alice can help me find it.  After I find that entry, I was going to get it to Jean Blair to get the writeoff forms written up.

Thanks,

Raetta

The attached list are outstanding receivables associated with the Central Region group that have occurred prior to December 2000. I would request that these receivables get written off in order to clean up the books. Total value $11,783.70.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.
