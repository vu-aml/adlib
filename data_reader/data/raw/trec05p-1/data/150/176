Subject: RE: Match.com - You've Got Mail: Hi Plucci!
Hello,

Thanks for sending me an email.  I appreciate the interest and found
your profile to be interesting as well.  But, I feel I'm at a
disadvantage due to the fact that your profile doesn't contain a
picture.  Are you sending a picture over later, or making me guess as to
what you look like?  Drop me a line and we can hash this out.

Paul

Subject: Match.com - You've Got Mail: Hi Plucci!


Hi - I'll be honest - I thought you were cute.  Hopefully you are as
interesting as you are attractive :)  

Take a look at my profile and send me an e-mail if you'd like.  Hope to
hear from you!

The following is my profile text:

I never thought I'd be using a "dating service". But I'm open to trying
new things - so let's give it a try. I'm an outgoing, positive, fun
person. I LOVE to travela nd experince new places and cultures. I'm
always learning something new - right now it's the guitar. I'm also
really happy being alone with myself to read, write, or just putz
around. I love kids, and they love me - probably because I'm pretty much
a kid at heart still. I'm very close to my family and have probably too
many good friends - I spend a lot of time keeping up with them all.
