Cara,

	Not a prob, the application wont look at the prod summary file unless you log in against PWRPRODN, so if you are logging against the test db's yer safe.. and for the summary to work it does require at least one previous summary detail in that excel file to work.. it uses that excel's defined macros and such to calculate the totals.. so doing a complete purge wouldnt do good.. do let me know if you have any questions about this.. be more than happy to help.
regards

Hi Asem;


O:\Portland\WestDesk\SCHEDULING\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTPROD.xls
This is the right address.  I am reluctant to add data to the production model, as it will mess up my reports.  I might rename a test file with a strange date, and then purge it.

That should work, eh?


Thanks,

C

Cara,

	Reason for the error is that the file it was looking for was titled PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTTestP.xls . Ive gone ahead and made changes to the application to read the file named as such. Since we're talking about locations of these summary files.. is the production report located at O:\Portland\WestDesk\SCHEDULING\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTPROD.xls ? unfortunately i dont have access to the directories to find out for myself. 

thanks
Asem

Good Afternoon,

I tried to run the Physical and Bookout summary, and got this error

"Unable to locate M:\Electric\Schedule\Process\WEST\Stage\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTTest.xls"
