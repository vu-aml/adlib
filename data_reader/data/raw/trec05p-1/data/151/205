THIRD CIRCUIT TASK FORCE URGES ONLY LIMITED USE OF AUCTIONS
TO PICK CLASS COUNSEL; JUDGES CRITICAL OF REPORT'S
NEGATIVITY

Judicially controlled auctions for the selection of counsel
in class actions should be used only in "certain limited
circumstances," according to a draft report issued by the
Third Circuit Task Force on Selection of Class Counsel. An
auction might be appropriate for a case in which the
defendant's liability appears clear, damages appear to be
both very large and collectible, and the lead plaintiff is
not a sophisticated litigant that has already retained
counsel of its choice through a reasonable, arm's-length
process, the task force suggests.

Several judges criticize the report as being too hostile
toward the innovative idea of competitive bidding for
selecting class counsel. The judges, participating in a
panel discussion at the 2001 Third Circuit Judicial
Conference, say the report is "too restrictive." For
instance, the task force should encourage more
experimentation with the process of setting fees at the
outset of litigation rather than waiting until the end, one
judge suggests. But others, who agree with the tenor of the
report, say bidding is overrated as a means of keeping
counsel fees reasonable. . . . Page s 2326,  . . . Page 2318

NEW YORK BAR PROPOSES AMENDING ABA MODEL RULES TO ALLOW
CAREFULLY REGULATED MULTIDISCIPLINARY ALLIANCES

The New York State Bar Association files a proposal with the
American Bar Association recommending amendment of the Model
Rules of Professional Conduct to allow limited and carefully
regulated "contractual relationships" and other affiliations
between lawyers and nonlawyers who want to offer their
clients integrated multidisciplinary services.

Foremost among the safeguards being advocated by the New
York bar are measures that would prohibit nonlawyers from
holding any ownership or managerial interest in law firms;
sharing legal fees with lawyers; directing or regulating the
professional judgment of lawyers; or compromising in any
other way a lawyer's duty to safeguard client interests. The
proposal is patterned on recent amendments to the New York
Code of Professional Responsibility allowing such
affiliations. . . . Page 2315

INS ADOPTS INTERIM PROCEDURES FOR ADJUDICATING CASES OF
UNREMOVABLE ALIENS SEEKING RELEASE FROM DETENTION

The Immigration and Naturalization Service issues an interim
rule governing detention of aliens who are subject to final
orders of removal but cannot likely be removed in the
foreseeable future because no country will accept them. The
rule responds to the U.S. Supreme Court's recent "Zadvydas"
decision, which held that, absent special circumstances, the
attorney general lacks authority to detain such aliens
indefinitely.

The rule specifies procedures for aliens who have been
detained beyond the statutory 90-day removal period to
demonstrate that their removal is unlikely in the reasonably
foreseeable future. Aliens seeking relief must make a
threshold showing that they have cooperated with the INS's
efforts to effect their removal. Aliens who prevail on such
claims must be released, subject to conditions of
supervision, unless "special circumstances" would render
release dangerous. . . . Page 2321

ATTORNEYS: The ABA ethic's committee says it is not
unethical for a former in-house corporate counsel to pursue

as the lawyer does not reveal more client information than
reasonably necessary to establish the claim. . . . Page 2315

legislation, already approved by the House, will almost
certainly be signed by the president. . . . Page 2324
