Latest NFL Player News

Jerome Bettis <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Fear Updated 01/08/02
According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Bettis will play in the team's Divisional Playoff Game in two weeks. "There's no question about the next game," Bettis said, "I'll be fine." Bettis missed Pittsburgh's final five games of the year due to a groin injury, but seems to have healed sufficiently enough to get back into the starting lineup. 

Correll Buckhalter <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
According to Phillynews.com, Buckhalter will see an increase in playing time behind starter Duce Staley on Saturday against Tampa Bay. Buckhalter, who ran for 89 yards against the Bucs on Sunday night, may even find himself in the same backfield as Staley in certain sets. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Tori Kuykendall Updated 01/08/02
Starting tailback Charlie Garner is a bit banged up, so Wheatley could see some additional carries on Saturday against the N.Y. Jets. "He gave us some pop inside, inside the five (-yard line)," Head Coach Jon Gruden told the Contra Costa Times . "The physical finish that allowed us to score a touchdown early in the game was vintage Tyrone Wheatley. No question, we'd like to see a heavier dose of the big man as the playoffs begin." Garner is expected to start, but Wheatley will likely get a majority of the short-yard and goal-line carries. 

Bills <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=4&>, DT BUF - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
Defensive end Phil Hansen announced his retirement from football this week. "My body and my heart tell me it's time to move on. I've known for a long time now that this would be my final season. I tried to keep it a secret because I didn't want it to become a distraction to any of my teammates," Hansen told the Boston Globe . Hansen started his career by making three straight Super Bowl appearances, but he ended his 11-year tenure one day after the Bills worst season (3-13) since 1985.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Baja Updated 01/08/02
Gadsden, who missed Sunday's game against Buffalo with a hamstring injury, will start on Sunday against Baltimore. However, he may be hard pressed to up good numbers against the Ravens' tough secondary. 

Dolphins <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=15&>, DT MIA - Matt Lenhart Updated 01/08/02
Linebacker Zach Thomas missed Sunday's game against Buffalo because of muscle spasms in his neck and pain from a muscle strain in his shoulder. "I won't be [sitting out] this week," Thomas told the Miami Herald. Thomas said he would have played if it were a playoff game, but he sat out so he wouldn't worsen the injuries for the postseason. 

Chris Chambers <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
Chambers suffered a sprained right ankle during Sunday's win over Buffalo. The rookie now has sprains in both of his ankles, and was removed from the game as a precaution. However, Chambers is expected to play in Sunday's game against Baltimore. 

Antonio Freeman <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1226&>, WR GB - Baja Updated 01/08/02
Freeman is nursing sore ribs, but he is expected to play on Sunday against San Francisco. The veteran wideout finished the regular season with 52 catches for 818 yards and five touchdowns. 

D'Wayne Bates <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=133222&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Bates could remain the No. 2 receiver for Chicago even if Dez White returns from a hamstring injury. "It's something we'll have to look at," Coach Dick Jauron said. "Hopefully Dez will be back and ready to play, and then we'll see whe! re! he is. Dez has done a real nice job for us, and D'Wayne has certainly stepped up and played really well." Bates has been productive in White's absence, posting 157 yards receiving over the past two games. 

Jason Brookins <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
Brookins returned from a foot injury on Monday night against Minnesota. He carried the ball seven times for 15 yards, and is expected to see an increase in his carries next Sunday against Miami. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=187389&>, K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 01/08/02
Janikowski will be available for Saturday's Wild Card Game against the N.Y. Jets. He had been dealing with a bout of cellulitis in his foot, but seems to have healed sufficiently after missing the team's regular season finale. 

Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=12384&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Fuamatu-Ma'afala left Sunday's game against Cleveland with a minor groin injury. The injury isn't considered serious, however, so Fuamatu-Ma'afala will be ready for Pittsburgh's Divisional Playoff game in two weeks. 

Seahawks <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=27&>, DT SEA - Baja Updated 01/07/02
Linebacker Anthony Simmons left Sunday's game against Kansas City in the second quarter after suffering a bruised left thigh. He did not return, and was on crutches and had his thigh heavily bandaged after the game. Cornerback Shawn S! pr! ings started the game at cornerback, but played only the first series before leaving with a nagging hamstring injury. "If we had to play one more football game, I'm not sure they could go next week," Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 

Eddie Kennison <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1296&>, WR KC - FIBSABs Updated 01/07/02
Kennison suffered an ankle injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. The injury isn't considered serious. Kennison had three catches for 74 yards in the game, and finished the year with 31 receptions for 491 yards and one touchdown. 

Kurt Warner <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=12797&>, QB STL - Baja Updated 01/07/02
Warner was hit in the throat during Sunday's St. Louis' 31-13 win over Atlanta, and has been told not to talk for a week. "They gave him some steroids, I think, to keep the swelling down, but he's fine," Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Warner said he got hit with either or knee or an elbow. "They just think there's some swelling around the vocal chords," Warner said. "It was tough to call (plays) in the huddle. Guys were laughing at me a little bit." Warner is fine and will start in the Divisional Round of the playoffs in two weeks. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1294&>, WR STL - Matt Lenhart Updated 01/07/02
Bruce left Sunday's game against Atlanta in the first quarter due to a lower back sprain. "It doesn't appear to be anything more than a sprain," Head Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. "So having a week off will obviously help us with Isaac. He could have probably come right back in this game." Bruce is expected to be ready when St. Louis plays their first playoff game in two weeks. 

Steve McNair <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Rocks Updated 01/07/02
McNair missed the second half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to back spasms. The injury isn't considered serious. McNair had an outstanding season, finishing with 3,350 yards passing and 26 total touchdowns. 

Tony Banks <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 01/07/02
Banks suffered a sprained right knee in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 20-17 win over Arizona. Banks, who may have played his final game as a Washington Redskin, will be re-evaluated this week. 

Charlie Garner <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 01/07/02
Garner suffered a foot injury during Sunday's 24-22 loss to the N.Y. Jets. He finished the game, however, and is expected to start in Oakland's opening-round playoff game. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=187389&>, K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 01/07/02
Janikowski missed Sunday's game against the N.Y. Jets due to a bout with cellulitis in his foot. Brad Daluiso kicked in his absence, and missed one field goal and an extra point. Janikowski will be re-evaluated this week, and should be available for Oakland's opening-round playoff game, barring any setbacks. 

Amani Toomer <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1262&>, WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 01/07/02
Toomer suffered a concussion during Sunday's 34-25 loss to the Green Bay Packers. The injury isn't considered too serious. Toomer finished the game with five receptions for 79 yards, giving him 72 catches for 1,054 yards and five touchdowns on the year. 

Terry Glenn <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1254&>, WR NE - Tori Kuykendall Updated 01/07/02
Glenn was inactive for Sunday's game against Carolina, and didn't make the trip to Charlotte with the team. According to the Boston Globe, there was much speculation as to why Glenn didn't play. One report indicated New England has already decided not to play him in the playoffs, and another said Glenn had missed meetings. Glenn did have an excused absence Wednesday, when he had to attend to a personal matter. 

Joe Horn <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1511&>, WR NO - Eric Bass Updated 01/07/02
Horn left Sunday's game against San Francisco in the third quarter with a sprained left knee and did not return. He caught three passes for 44 yards before suffering the injury, and finished the season with 83 catches for 1,265 yards and a career-high nine touchdowns. 

Cris Carter <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 01/07/02
Carter (ribs) is listed as probable for Monday's game against Baltimore. It is still uncertain whether or not Carter will play, so Jake Reed could see some extended playing time. In any event, the game will likely be Carter's last in a Minnesota Vikings' uniform. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=12400&>, TE KC - The Klap Updated 01/07/02
Gonzalez suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. "Right now, it's still hard to tell the extent of the injury," General Manager Peterson told the Kansas City Star. "The MCL is loose. The rest of it doesn't seem to be a real concern. But I'm saying that without giving it a good look." Although the injury will keep Gonzalez out of the Pro Bowl, it shouldn't keep him from being ready for the start of the 2002 season. Further! t! ests are expected to be taken this week. 

Mike Hollis <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1387&>, K JAC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 01/07/02
Hollis was benched late in Sunday's game against Chicago after having a first-quarter field goal blocked and later missing his second extra point of the season. Hollis, who is now an unrestricted free agent, is not expected to return to the Jaguars for the 2002 season. 

Marcus Pollard <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1335&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
