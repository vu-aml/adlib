CNN Tonight:  Valerie Bertinelli’s Fight to Lose Weight

Valerie Bertinelli in a primetime exclusive!
Her plan to lose weight as the whole country looks on.
Did her stressful split from rocker hubby Eddie Van
Halen have anything to do with her weight gain?

But first, an inside look at the meeting yesterday between
Don Imus and the Rutgers women’s basketball team.
They’ve accepted his apology, but he'd
already been fired - the debate heats up.
Plus, the pastor who mediated that meeting tells us how it all
went down and how this could become a catalyst for more change.

Tonight only on Larry King Live!
