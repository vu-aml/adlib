PM heeds call to lift migration 


THE Federal Government is considering increasing the migrant intake to ease a shortage of skilled workers, with Prime Minister Mr John Howard yesterday backing the plan. 

Immigration Minister Senator Amanda Vanstone would not comment on reports yesterday that she planned to increase the migrant intake for one year by 20,000 skilled places. 

That would take the overall intake to around 140,000 next financial year the biggest intake in almost 20 years. 

But Mr Howard said the Government would consider adjusting the migrant intake in favour of skilled migrants, particularly those who spoke English. 

"I am in favour of adjusting our migration program if there is an economic need" Mr Howard said. 

"We have an economic need at the moment for more skilled people. 

"You cant generate them out of thin air in Australia. 

"And if part of the solution to that problem is to bring in more skilled migrants then I am in favour of it. 

&#8220;We will look at that issue very closely in the very near future. 

He said Australia had a non-discriminatory immigration policy and would take people who fitted the bill from anywhere in the world. 

"But obviously people who have the training and if their language skills are more advanced in English, then obviously that helps as well, he said. 

"Thats not a mandatory requirement, but it can be an advantage when youre trying to get people who will fit in very quickly. 

Treasurer Mr Peter Costello has also backed an increase in the skilled migrant intake but has ruled out a guest worker scheme to overcome the skills shortage. 

But NSW Premier Mr Bob Carr said his State would need more money if the Federal Government expected it to take in more people. 

Mr Carr said there were 1000 new arrivals in Sydney every week and NSW needed more funding to provide extra infrastructure for them such as roads, hospitals, public transport and school facilities. 

The Australian Democrats said the proposal showed the Government had failed to manage the labour market. 

And a migrant group said the skills shortage could be alleviated if professional bodies such as medical specialist colleges were pressured into accepting qualified migrant workers. 

Why apply for Australia Permanent Residence status now?

If you would like to explore employment opportunities in Australia, it is advisable to obtain a permanent residence status first as most employers prefer to hire either locals or applicants with a permanent residence status.  

A common mistake is to apply for permanent residence when one needs it.  A better approach is to plan ahead and apply for it when you are eligible.   

Changes which can affect your eligibility 

-Changes in immigration policy 
-Changes in pass mark 
-Changes in assessment criteria 
-Changes in occupational demand 

You do not need to relocate immediately after your application for permanent residence is approved.  Normally, you can wait for 3 years from date of approval to relocate.  Furthermore, the application and approval process can take a long time, usually more than a year.   

We look forward to a meeting to discuss your needs.
