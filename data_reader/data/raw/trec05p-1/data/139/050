Here is the org chart that captures our discussions.  I think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ENA and EES.

Total headcount = 21.  The personnel cost = $6.4 MM (total for ENA and EES).    

Please let me know if you have any questions.
