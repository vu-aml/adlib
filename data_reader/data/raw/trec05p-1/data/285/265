Pig,

There is a key to the left of the number one that contains the "little
squiggly thing".  How you get your "little squiggly thing" on top of the
N is a different matter.  Let me know if you figure it out.......

I think that was LN's feeble attempt at "Spanish"...aka SENOR....Hey
how do you type the little squiggly thing on top of the "n" ???

	What's the deal. No traffic all week. Makes coming to work
really lame.
	
	Here's something to talk about. Karnes City!!! Like it is time
to cut checks
	again and mail them to the opielas before they call me and hit
me up for a
	raise on our rent.
	
	John:Last year looks like the break down was as follows: you
wrote a ckedk
	to Rancho Grande Trust for 2,600 and collected from Mark and
Matt.
	I wrote one for 900 and collected from pig, shet, smack, hudge
and senior
	saftey.
	
	SO Brian, Chet, Chad, Hudge and Joe need to cut me a check for
150 a piece
	and mail it to my office 815 walker #1447 H/T 77002.
	
	If you are not interested in getting back on, let me know so I
can fill your
	spot.
	
	John, mail your check and I will send off with mine and contract
for emerick
