Louise and John,

Thank you for having the meeting with all Gas and Power origination this morning.  I was very impressed by the employee attendance and your responses to individuals' concerns.  I would recommend having periodic meetings in the future.  My only disappointment was the most of my questions should have been articulated by my employees because they were concerns and queries articulated to me these past few days.  I have appropriately chided them and will chalk it up to stage fright.

Regards, Mrha
