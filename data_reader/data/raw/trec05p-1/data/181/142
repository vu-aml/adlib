NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Martin Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=133297&>, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 12/28/01
Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. 

MarTay Jenkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=133322&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 12/28/01
Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.

Brian Finneran <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=12366&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Tyrone Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1499&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone. 

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/28/01
Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1236&> , WR JAC - Frank Updated 12/28/01
Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play. 

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 12/28/01
Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week. 

Aaron Shea <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=187642&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out. 

Jason Brookins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/28/01
Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17.

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/28/01
Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1859&> , WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/28/01
Thrash (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. he is expected to play this week. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Walls missed practice on Thursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime decision this week. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/28/01
A banged-up Smith Toe/knee) will continue to start for the Falcons. But Dan Reeves has indicated Rodney Thomas will continue to get some work at halfback. 

Bob Christian <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1077&>, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Christian is day to day with a calf injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/28/01
Davis (knee) has returned to practice. He is expected to start this week. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's "full strength" criteria for starting against Green Bay. Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/28/01
Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the first time in a month. "Still questionable," coach Bill Cowher said. "He did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll take it day to day." 

Doug Brien <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1393&>, K IND - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Brien signed a one-year contract Thursday night with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who will use him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica can't kick this week. Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 48-21 victory over the Saints last week. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out for Saturday night's game against Baltimore, however the c! lu! b wanted to have a backup plan in case the Pro Bowl kicker isn't ready. 

Ahman Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 12/28/01
According to the Pro Football News and Injury Report, Green has asthma, but he has practiced fully this week and will start against the Vikings. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/27/01
Thrash is listed as questionable with an ankle injury, but he is expected to play against the Giants. 

Patrick Jeffers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1515&> , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Jeffers may see some increased playing time this week because of Muhsin Muhammad's persistent toe problems. Isaac Byrd, however, still should start in Muhammad's place. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=187389&>, K OAK - Matty Updated 12/27/01
Janikowski (groin) has been kicking in practice. He is expected to play this week. 

Terrence Wilkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Wilkins (hamstring) has returned to practice. He may be able to play this week. 

Stephen Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Alexander (leg) was placed on injured reserve, officially ending his season. Walter Rasby will continue to start in his place, but Zeron Flemister has emerged as the team's best receiving tight end with Alexander out. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/27/01
The Seattle Times says Hasselbeck's season might be over. Mike Holmgren said he would only use him in an emergency this week, and the Seahawks coach may elect to have Hasselbeck use the season's final two games to rest his injured shoulder. Trent Dilfer will start at San Diego this week. 

Amos Zereoue <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Zereoue missed practice on Wednesday with a shoulder injury. He is listed as probable for this week. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Bouman practiced without pads on Wednesday. If he cannot practice fully on Thursday, Spergon Wynn will get the start this week.
