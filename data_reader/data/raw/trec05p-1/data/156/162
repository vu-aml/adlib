NFL Reports, Player Updates

Latest NFL Player News

Peter Warrick <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=187401&>, WR CIN - Giggles Updated 11/30/01
Warrick missed practice on Thursday because of a sore shoulder. However, published reports state that he still expects to play Sunday. 

Rob Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1033&>, QB BUF - Giggles Updated 11/30/01
The Buffalo News says Johnson's season is all but done because of his broken collarbone. He may not play again this year, so it appears safe to continue using Alex Van Pelt if you have him on your roster. Johnson was waering a harness o! n ! Thursday, and he may be placed on injured reserve.

Reggie Wayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Wayne (knee) is now expected to miss Sunday's game. Terrence Wilkins will start in his place again.

Trevor Insley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=188095&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Insley is now expected to miss Sunday's game. He has not sufficiently recovered from a concussion, says the Indianapolis Star. Tony Simmons will likely be the Colts' No. 3 receiver this week.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/30/01
Chrebet is still being bothered by a bruised shoulder, will not miss any playing time. The New York Post says he still looks good in practice.

Terry Glenn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 11/30/01
Glenn, who has been suspended for Sunday's game against the Jets, may have played his last game for New England. According to published reports, his locker has been cleaned out. It is time for Fantasy owners to cut the receiver if they still have him on the roster.

Jimmy Kleinsasser <http://football222.fantas! y.! sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=133340&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Kleinsasser (ankle) is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. He isn't heavily involved in Minnesota's offesive game plan, so he has little chance to be a productive Fantasy player. 

Michael Bennett <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Bennett had his best rushing game of the season last week, going for 75 yards against Chicago. He's still been a huge disappointment overall, and isn't worth starting in most Fantasy leagues. 

Cris Carter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 11/29/01
Considering his past success, Carter has been very inconsistent this season. He could find it tough to be productive against Pittsburgh's top-ranked defense, but he's still worth starting based on his potential to put up solid Fantasy numbers. 

Byron Chamberlain <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1496&>, TE MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Chamberlain posted solid numbers last week against Chicago, catching seven passes for 56 yards. He has been a bit inconsistent recently, but he's still worth starting on a weekly basis unless you have a better option on! y! our roster. 

Randy Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/29/01
Moss will face a tough Pittsburgh defense on Sunday, which is ranked No. 1 overall in the league. He's hasn't been playing up to his high standards this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers. 

Ricky Williams <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=133448&>, RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/29/01
Williams has finally stayed healthy, and has become one of the top running backs in Fantasy Football. Be sure to give him the start in Week 12 against Carolina, whose defense is ranked last in the entire league. 

Stephen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/29/01
Davis is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Dallas due to a back injury. He's worth starting in deeper Fantasy leagues against the Cowboys, but don't expect huge numbers from the big tailback. 

Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Banks continues to be inc! on! sistent, especially over the last two weeks. He has been held without a touchdown pass over that span, and isn't worth starting against an underrated Dallas defense. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Despite catching three touchdowns in his last four games, Westbrook is still very unreliable as a Fantasy player. He did have a touchdown catch in his first meeting of the year against Dallas, but it was his only catch of the game. Unless you play in a deeper league, benching Westbrook is advisable. 

Torry Holt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=133310&>, WR STL - Tori Updated 11/29/01
Holt had a huge game last week against Tampa Bay, catching eight passes for 139 yards. He should put up solid numbers against a questionable Atlanta secondary, so be sure to start him in Week 12. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 11/29/01
Bruce may not be having his best statistical season, but he's still worth starting on a weekly basis. He has four touchdowns in his last three games vs. Atlanta, so be sure to get him into your starting lineup. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 11/29/01
Faulk actually had a down we! ek! against Tampa Bay on Monday night, posting only 66 scrimmage yards and no touchdowns. He'll bounce back against Atlanta, and is a must-start in any Fantasy league format on a weekly basis. 

Ernie Conwell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1366&>, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Conwell played on Monday night against Tampa Bay despite a shoulder injury. He had only 38 yards receiving in the game, and is becoming increasingly unreliable as a Fantasy player. If you have a better tight end on your roster, you may want to consider benching Conwell in Week 12. 

Kurt Warner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 11/29/01
Warner has been very inconsistent recently, throwing six touchdowns and 11 interceptions over his last four games. He's far too valuable to consider benching, however, and he should bounce back against Atlanta in Week 12. 

Richard Huntley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1456&>, RB CAR - Russell Updated 11/29/01
Huntley's numbers have improved a bit over the last two weeks, but he's still far too unreliable to start on a weekly basis. Unless you're desperate for a running back, benching Huntley is advisable. 

Isaac Byrd <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1762&>, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Byrd w! il! l start in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad for the second consecutive week. He posted five catches for 69 yards against Atlanta last week, and could be a decent sleeper against a vulnerable New Orleans secondary in Week 12. 

Donald Hayes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/29/01
Hayes is a bit banged up, but he will start in Week 12 against New Orleans. The Saints secondary is questionable at best, so starting Hayes in a deeper league is worth considering. 

Wesley Walls <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Walls was held to only one catch for eight yards last week against Atlanta. He may not be as reliable as he's been in the past, but Walls is still worth starting on a weekly basis, especially in deeper leagues.

Fred Taylor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/29/01
Taylor, still recovering from a groin injury, is listed as questionable for Monday's game. Don't expect him to be too productive this week if he does play. He is not at full strength. 

James Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/29/01
Jackson was limited in practice Wednesday because ! of! a sprained ankle. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. Benjamin Gay is expected to start in his place. 

Ahman Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 11/29/01
Green has emerged as one of the top backs in Fantasy Football this season. As a result, starting him on a weekly basis is advisable, especially against inconsistent defenses like Jacksonville. 

Antonio Freeman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1226&>, WR GB - Hunter Updated 11/29/01
Freeman seems to have re-emerged as Brett Favre's go-to-guy in recent weeks, which is evident in his stats over the past four games. He'll post solid numbers against Jacksonville on Monday night, so be sure to start him in Week 12. 

Shannon Sharpe <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1329&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Sharpe is listed as probable for Sunday's game. He missed practice Wednesday because of a knee injury.

Bubba Franks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
After a solid start, Franks has been held out of the end zone for four consecutve games. With the lack! o! f quality tight ends in the league, however, Franks is still worth starting in most Fantasy formats.
