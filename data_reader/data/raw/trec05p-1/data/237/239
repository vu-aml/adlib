It works similiar to your recent purchase but adds to it to help you
in those intimate moments with your partner. It is definately 
gua ran-teed to help spice up your night life in the bed`room. 

As always, If your not completely satis fied then all you need to do
is send it back us and you'll get a full re-fund.
