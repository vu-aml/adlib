Dear sir,
Thank you for taking the time to read this mail. My name is Mrs. MARTHA 
PUJEH, from Diamond rich country district of Bombali in Northern Province of 
Sierra Leone. I am the widow of the Late Mr. MOMOH PUJEH, the managing 
director of Sierra Leone diamond mining co-operation. I am currently living 
in a refugee center in London, UK.My family and I have been unfortunate to 
find ourselves caught up in a very difficult situation in London. I know you 
will be surprise to receive this message, but it is of utmost importance to 
me and my family.

Anyway, I am about to entrust my destiny and the destiny of my whole 
dependants on your shoulder if you can help us, it will also be of immense 
benefit to you too. This transaction demands utmost trust, honesty, 
integrity and most important, secrecy. It is only through the above that my 
family and I will be assured of our security.This regrettable situation led 
to the killing of my husband and only daughter and the displacement of my 
family.

During the brutal civil war in my country Sierra Leone, my late husband of 
blessed memory was brutally murdered by the rebels led by Mr. Foday 
Sankoh,he was murdered with my only daughter (Nina). But my two sons (Greg & 
Daniel) and I managed to escape to UK, through the help of the
International Rescue Committee (IRC).

But before my late husband's death, he drew my attention to a box containing 
about twelve million US dollars ($12 Million) which he smuggled out at the 
start of the war to a security company in Spain, Europe. (The security 
company does not know the real contents of the box. He registered it in the 
name of my son Greg Pujeh as family art and monuments) He also gave me the 
certificate of deposit and receipt issued to him by the security company, 
which I still have in my possession.

The problem I have is that as a refugee, the immigration law does not allow 
us to open or hold operate bank account in London and I do not want to seek 
the assistance of just anybody for fear of being duped or defraud of our 
only livelihood, I have sold almost all my jewelries to keep body and soul 
together, hence the British Government is not really taking care of us.

What is required of you is to give us your full name,telephone and fax 
numbers  and contact address so that I can secure a Power of Attorney in 
your favour that would enable you contact the security company as the 
beneficiary of the box. You can then transfer the funds to your bank account 
after the box must have been released to you. In order to make it worth your 
while, we will give you  part of the money. We have also map out 5% of the 
principal sum for any expenses that you may incurred during the transaction 
process which includes your traveling expenses, we intend to invest the 
remaining part of the money on your advice in any lucrative business 
ventures in your country, you may even act as our financial adviser if you 
are so disposed.

If you want to help, you can contact my son Greg Pujeh who recently got a 
job in one of the local firms here in London on his email address 
(greg_pujeh2@yahoo.co.uk)
I am looking forward to your immediate response, as I believe that destiny 
has brought us together.

Yours Faithfully,
Mrs. Martha Pujeh
