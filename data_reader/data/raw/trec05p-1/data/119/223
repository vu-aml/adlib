GOD IS UP TO SOMETHING -- (T.D. Jakes) 
"When you are DOWN to nothing ... God is UP to 
something" 
Father, in the Name of Jesus, bless the one 
reading this in a special 
way. Open supernatural doors in their life today. 
Save and set free! 
Give them a double portion of your Spirit as we 
take back everything 
that the devil has stolen: Emotional Health, 
Physical Health Finances, 
Relationships, Children, Jobs, Homes,Marriages. 
I cancel every plot, plan and scheme the enemy 
has devised against 
them, in 
the MATCHLESS NAME OF JESUS. 
And I declare: 
NO WEAPON FORMED AGAINST THEM WILL PROSPER. 
I speak LIFE into every dead situation. And, I 
thank you that nothing 
is over until YOU say it's over! I speak 
prophetically into their 
lives and to their situations: 
Their household is blessed; 
Their health is blessed; 
Their marriage is blessed; 
Their finances are blessed; 
Their jobs are blessed; 
Their children are blessed; 
Their grandchildren are blessed; 
Their parents are blessed; 
Their siblings are blessed; 
Their ministries are blessed; and, 
Their decisions are blessed. 
Husbands are on the way; 
Wives are on the way; 
Mortgages are paid and canceled; 
Their hearts desires are on the way; 
according to YOUR perfect will and Plan for their 
lives. 
IN THE NAME OF JESUS! AMEN! 
Pray this prayer back to the one who prayed it 
for you, then 
Send to EVERYBODY YOU KNOW. Within hours 
countless people will have 
prayed for you, and you will have caused a 
multitude of people to pray 
to God for other people. 
"In our daily lives, we must see that it is not 
happiness that 
makes us grateful, but the gratefulness that 
makes us happy."
