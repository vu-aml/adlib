Not looking good right now for space at the JT skid for November.  I have
calls into the field to try and determine our max throughput.  We have a
capital project going that should increase our throughput, but it may not
be finished for a couple of weeks.  Will let you know by the end of the day
where we're at.  How much is it worth to you?  There may be a bidding
war...........
