Gerald,

How should I handle this?  Is this something normally done during the legal (risk mgmt., etc.) review by someone in your group, RAC....???  

Gracias!

Dave,

I am working on the agreement now.  Please don't forget to get with Don
Rollins (at ENA) to determine  the insurance and the limits we will require
the operating company to carry.
Thx

Ken
