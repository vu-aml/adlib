As you may or may not be aware, The Dicks, Kudlas and Erbs are all going to
the Aeros game Friday night after practice.  The kids were given Aeros
tickets for good grades.  We also stumbled upon four additional tickets
(thru work) and were wondering if you and your family would like to use
them.  I have no idea where all the seats are located, but I'm sure we
could
probably all relocate around each other.  Let me know if you would like to
use the tickets.  If not, we can return them and somebody else can use
them.
