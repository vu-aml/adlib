Cheryl/Sara,
I hope that after recent events we find you and yours all well.

We are still looking for information as to how we should proceed
in initiating an ISDA Master Agreement between Enron Capital &
Trade Resources International Corp. Cargill International, S.A.
("CISA").  Could someone kindly advise?

Thanks,

should
   be speaking?

   Mara, my notes indicate otherwise -- that you had decided to talk to
a
   contact in London.  If that is no the case, let me.

      Hi Cheryl,

      I haven't had a response to our queries about putting in place an
   ISDA
      between Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. and
our
      Geneva affiliate, Cargill International, S.A. ("CISA").  We've
been
      trying to get negotiations started since January; I was hoping you
      could direct me to the appropriate party to contact at Enron so
that
      we can get things moving on this ISDA?

      Many thanks,

      Dear Cheryl,

      I've again had inquiries from our Geneva affiliate, Cargill
      International, S.A. ("CISA") regarding an ISDA Master Agreement
      with Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.  Are
      you still the attorney who would be handling this Agreement?
      If not, could you kindly advise whom I should contact?

      I assume that Enron would prefer to send the initial draft
      documents.  If this is the case, please note that CISA enters
      into its ISDA Master Agreements without benefit of a Credit
      Support Provider or a Credit Support Annex.  Regarding their
      administrative details, their address is:

      Mara,

      The answer may turn on a key question.  What products would be
      traded?Where
      are the trades going to come from?

   International,

      Dear Sara & Cheryl,

      I have been asked by our affiliate in Geneva, Cargill
      International, S.A. ("CISA"), to begin negotiations for
      them on an ISDA Master Agreement with Enron.

      There had been some question as to which Enron entity
      was to enter into an ISDA with CISA, but the latest
      information they had (possibly from someone in an Enron
      office in London?) was that it should be Enron Capital
      & Trade Resources International Corp.  FYI, Cargill
      International, S.A. is located and incorporated in Geneva.

      Could you kindly advise whom I should be contacting to
      confirm this is indeed the proper Enron entity and with
      whom I should be speaking to begin negotiations?  Please
      also let me know if there is anything that needs to be
      done from a Credit or Trading perspective in order to
      get this ISDA started on Enron's part.

      Thanks and Regards,
