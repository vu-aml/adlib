Sara,

I called Scott with no answer.  My contact does not know who he is, but suggested you could send the ECI and ENA agreements to her and she would ensure both were put in place with her legal and compliance people.

You can send the completed agreements to:

Kelly Keneally

Phone: 212/538-5581
Fax: 212/538-4057

Please advise me when you send the documents out so I can ensure they are dealt with properly.

Thanks,

Tom

Tom:

We would like to use the same format which was agreed to by ENA and CSFB.  That agreement was sent for execution on July 6, 2001 and we have never received an executed version.

Please feel free to contact Scott Kreuzinger (phone is 617-556-5730 or fax is 617-542-1814) to ensure that ENA has executed docs which can also be duplicated for ECI.  Perhaps your contact at CSFB can assist.  Scott Kreuzinger was ENA's contact for having docs executed.

We have been unable to extract any response from Scott Kreuzinger.

Thanks.
