The weekly EES/EWS meeting with Rick Causey, Rick Buy and Dan Leff on Thursdays from 3:00 - 4:00 pm in EB3321 is being revamped to insure that the agenda and format for the meeting are organized to maximize the benefit from these recurring meetings.  In reviewing the availability of key players over the next several weeks and to allow time to create meaningful tracking documents for critical milestones, the Thursday meetings will be cancelled from now through the first week in September.  The meeting will resume beginning Thursday, September 13 from 3:00 to 4:00 and will be held every other week from that point forward.   You will be notified prior to the resumption of these meetings in September if you need to put this on your calendar as a recurring meeting.  The list of attendees is being reviewed, with the possibility of reducing the number of attendees in an effort to utilize people's time wisely and to create an atmosphere for frank dialogue regarding progress.
