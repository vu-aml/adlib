	All,
	The registry for testing tomorrow is posted at the NERC 
	site http://server06.nerc.com/tag/. It has been updated 
	and SHOULD contain all correct information. If anyone 
	has any problems, speak up ASAP. 
	The registry has some minor changes:
	1) Data Types and lengths have been added.
	2) Constraints have been added.
	3) 2 new tables have been added, 
	    Pending_Desk_Registry and Pending_Entity_Registry
	4) The field 'Pseudo_CA' has been added to the PSE
	    and CA Registries.
	5) Relationships between tables has been implemented.
	6) SC Codes are mapped in the SC_Code field
	    for CAs.
	
	Please read notes on changes below:	
	a) It only impacts the MDB. If you use the CSVs, everything 
	     will be the same (except for the new tables and the one 
	     new field). 
	b) The new tables (Pending Entity, Pending Desk) do 
	     NOT need to be used. Rather, they are "value adds"
	     that can be used by a vendor to aid their customers. 
	c) The intent of this is so that anyone using the MDBs 
	     will not have to go parse everything into dates, 
	     integers, etc... it does not change anything else.

	The data dictionary posted on the E-Tag site contained 
	an error in the order of fields in the POR/POD table.  
	The order should be as follows:
		PORPODPointID
		NERC_ID
		PointName
		TP_Entity
		CA_Entity
		PORPODRoleID
		CreationDate
		DeactivationDate
	A new Data Dictionary will be posted with the corrections
	ASAP.
	
	Thank You,
	Paul Baratelli
