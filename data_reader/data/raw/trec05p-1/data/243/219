John,
I need your advice.  My sister and I have decided to take a trip together
this fall.  We are interested in about a 6-7 day trip (does not include
travel days), splitting it between London and Paris.

We thought we'd fly to London and spend a few days, then take the tunnel
bullet train to Paris and spend a few day and return to London to fly home.

Our questions are:

1.  When is a better time to visit Paris, September or October - we want to
avoid high tourist season and maybe capitalize on lower hotel prices.

2.  My sister has visited London many times and has friends there, so we
won't have any trouble with an agenda, however, we've never been to Paris.

3.  For 2-3 days what would you recommend we do/see in Paris?
Highlights: the Louvre, the Orsay, Saint Chapelle (behind Notre Dame), the
sewer tour (I'm not kidding), shopping at Galleries Lafayette and Printemps,
the Eiffel Tower, other stuff?

4.  What reasonably priced hotels would you recommend in Paris?
Kim found one in the more residential area that is near ??

5.  Any other advice/tips?
Try to eat at Cafe/Bistro Bacchanal (something like that).  We ate there on
one trip and couldn't get in the next time.
Buy your Metro tickets by the carnet (10 at a time).

Thank you so much,
Jane
