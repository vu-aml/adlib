>>Two older men are sitting on a park bench talking and one of them asks
>>the other about his sex life. The man answers that he has an excellent
>>sex life and is still very active. The other man confesses that his
>>sexual appetite has greatly diminished with old age so he asks the other
>>man if he has any secrets for staying sexually vital.
>>"Well," answered the man, "I eat rye bread everyday. That is my secret.
>>If you just eat rye bread, your sex life will improve dramatically." The
>>other man decides to follow this advice and finds a bakery nearby. He
>>tells the clerk behind the counter that he wants all of the loaves of
>>rye bread that they have in stock. The clerk then asks the man, "do you
>>want whole loaves or do you want us to slice them?"
>>The man looks puzzled and asks the clerk, "what is the difference?"
>>The clerk responds, "well when it's sliced, it gets harder faster." To
>>which the man responded, "how come everyone knew about this but me."
