Ken Lay is very interested in providing opportunities for the Enron Corp. Board of Directors to become well-acquainted with Enron's management team.  You are invited to join Enron's Board on Monday evening, October 8, at the Four Seasons, Austin Room.   Please come for cocktails at 6:45 p.m., followed by the Executive Session of the Board at 7:00 p.m.  The group invited includes Management Committee members who either head up corporate functions or are the CEOs of business units.  

An agenda will be provided for you Monday evening but, for your information, the Board's working dinner will include a financial update by Rick Causey, an investor relations update by Mark Koenig, other business, and reports on the day's earlier Committee meetings.

Your participation is important. Please RSVP to Kelly Johnson at extension 36485 or via email to kelly.johnson@enron.com by Thursday, October 4th at Noon.

In addition, the entire Management Committee has previously been invited to join the Board for its open session the following day, Tuesday, October 9, beginning at approximately 9 a.m. in the Boardroom and for a seated lunch in 50M following the session.  If you have not responded to Kelly yet, we look forward to hearing from you.  
 
Thanks.  Paula
