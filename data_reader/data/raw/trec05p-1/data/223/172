to lay claims to this money as the heir. We cannot release the fund
from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to
the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Upon this
discovery,we now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of
kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worked out by=

us for the funds (US$11,500,000.00) to be released in your favour as
