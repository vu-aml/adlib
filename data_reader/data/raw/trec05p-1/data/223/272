 	  	 Dear Andrew,

Some of the star witnesses in the Enron collapse will appear Thursday at a hearing on Capitol Hill. The question remains: Will they have anything to say? The witness list includes former Enron Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says Fastow is expected to invoke his constitutional privilege not to speak, but Skilling has indicated he'll talk. We'll have live reports covering the hearing from our Washington bureau on Thursday. 

Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge is expected to speak in front of the National Press Club on Thursday. We'll bring you all the details on Ridge's speech from the Washington bureau on Thursday. 

Tomorrow in Houston, the Ziff Energy Group is hosting the North American Gas Storage Conference. Plans for hundreds of new gas-fired power plants have been cancelled recently, resulting in record levels of gas in storage. The Houston bureau will bring us coverage of the Conference and we'll hear how company executives are dealing with too much gas in storage. 

Also from Houston on Thursday, Petrobras President Renato Bertani talks about problems his company is having with the development of offshore reserves in Brazil. He says Brazil doesn't have access to developing technologies that allow for deep-water exploration. 

Shell WindEnergy is acquiring the Llano Estacado Wind Ranch located near White Deer, Texas. During the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast, Industrial Information Resources Production Industry Power Manager Britt Burt will join us in Houston to discuss the acquisition of Shell's second wind farm. 

ENL's Kym McNicholas will have more from California Senator Joe Dunn, Chair of the Senate Committee investigating price manipulation in the state's wholesale energy market, regarding Enron's refusal to comply with a subpoena to attend a deposition Wednesday. Dunn will discuss the committee's next steps on Thursday. 

Also on Thursday, Raymond James & Associates Analyst Jon Cartwright will speak with Kym from St. Petersburg, Florida. At 3:00 p.m. ET, he'll discuss Calpine and the market reaction to news of an SEC request for information concerning selective disclosure.
