VENTURE 
MARKET 
SUMMARY 

	It wasn't as big a day funding wise compared to yesterday's $300 million windfall, but eight companies still managed to pull in a respectable $186 million. The big fundings went to three companies, all in the fourth round. Chorum Technologies, a provider of all-optical processors and subsystems for optical networks, raised $54.7 million in its fourth round of funding led by previous investors CenterPoint Ventures, InterWest Partners, Sevin Rosen Funds, and Scudder-Kemper Investments. 

Four was also a lucky number for Encorp, a provider of products and services for the power-technology sector, that closed $38.1 million in Series D financing led by new investor Ballentine Capital Partners. Meanwhile 2Wire, a developer of products that provide broadband content and services throughout the home, announced that it closed its fourth round of funding at $61 million that VentureWire first reported in August. 

Napster is also back in the news as it tries to change its tune. The embattled online song-swapping service, cut 16 employees, approximately 15% of its staff, in an effort to strengthen resources in other areas as it prepares for the launch of its new membership-based service. The layoffs mainly affected the customer service, business development departments, and administration areas and leave the company with a staff of 88. - By John Fuller <mailto:fuller@technologicp.com>

Rethink, Rebuild, Rebound

This is the worst downturn ever to hit Silicon Valley,
but it's hardly the first. So VentureWire is convening
a summit conference of CEOs, COOs, CFOs, and others
who've lead venture-backed companies through such times
before. We've chosen them for their years of experience
and for their ability to share it as coaches, mentors,
board members, and friends. Join us for an intense day
of guidance an inspiration from those who've been
through boom and bust and boom again.

Healthcare Outlook: Biotechnology  Pharmaceuticals:
development, delivery and distribution

Tremendous competition exists to find the new technology
that will identify new drug targets. Bioinformatics
companies that can bring precision to the R&D process,
but yet, may never be profitable. An expensive and
pitfall ridden drug approval  process.  A complex
business landscape created by the mergers of giant,
multinational pharmaceutical companies and upstart
biotech ventures. In the span of one day Healthcare
Outlook will address these issues and look at the
business plans of 50 private companies that promise
to innovate an industry. Industry executives, leading
academics and venture capitalists will meet to lend
perspective and point out opportunities along the
complicated life cycle of developing a drug.
