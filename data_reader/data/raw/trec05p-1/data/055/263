Below are copies of the prepared statements of commissioners Wood, Massey and Breathitt for this afternoon's House hearing on electricity issues.  The witnesses are the four FERC commissioners on one panel and the Deputy Sec. of Energy on a second panel.  Chairman Wood's statement is very strong on RTOs and why a few, larger ones are needed for economic and security reasons.  The only troublesome note is he describes the recent mediation proceedings as "encouraging."  However, elsewhere he refers to voluntary RTO formation in the past tense, saying "the Commission can go further and require them" (although he raises the likelihood of litigation unless Congress clarifies the Commission's authority in this area.  I will provide a more detailed report after the hearing.
 
P.S.  Since the commissioner's statements are in word perfect, you will need the right computer software or know how to reformat them.  If you have any trouble, please advise.  This is the format in which we received them.  Thanks.
