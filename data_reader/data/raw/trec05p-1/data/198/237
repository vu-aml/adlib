I liked Cole's, too, and especially the quiet, homey atmosphere.  Richard Cole
has been around the local restaurant scene for years, and he and his partner Paul
did almost all of the build-out themselves, and Richard is chef.  It's nice to
see local folks open a little local restaurant.  Maybe they'll be another
Barnaby's success story.

Speaking of which, it's all but impossible to get into the newly opened Barnaby's
on West Gray--already.  And at least three other restaurants have died at that
location--amazing!
