HELP SEND STEVE TO PHILLY! 

Jan. 10 - Cast a few votes for your favorite Rockets All-Stars at Compaq Center this Saturday when the Rockets host the Denver Nuggets and you could walk away with a Steve Francis autographed T-shirt or an authentic Francis autographed jersey!   <http://www.nba.com/media/rockets/francis_upcourt_011108.jpg>

Steve would like to spend his All-Star break in Philadelphia this year with Shaq, Kobe, KG and the rest of the Western Conference's best. He currently stands second in balloting behind Kobe Bryant among Western Conference guards, which would land him a starting position on this year's All-Star team. Help ensure Steve holds off Gary Payton for that final starting spot by casting your ballot today <http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=151611&UID=45456540&MID=201627>!

Saturday is your last chance to vote at Compaq Center and pick up some cool Francis autographed merchandise. For complete details on how you can be one of the lucky fans to walk away with a Steve Francis autographed T-shirt or jersey, head to the All-Star balloting table outside Section 103 on the Compaq Center concourse before or during Saturday's game.
