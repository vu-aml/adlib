I really appreciate your note.  Beth continues to have concerns with the notion of me getting on an airplane ... a fact that comes out in interesting ways during the day.  Thank you for giving us an opportunity to let the discomfort pass or lessen.  

It's always been hard to determine what is essential vs. nonessential travel.  Our jobs involve personal touch and contact.  We can't stay off of airplanes for very long without compromising some of our effectiveness.  On the positive side, very few of our elected friends outside of California are even thinking about energy issues.

I've done a good job of clearing the calendar for the next two weeks, but I'm already booking trips the first week of October.  Hopefully the world will be calm during the interim and we can all get back to some semblance of normalcy.  

Paul

    The events of September 11th are still very much with us and will continue to be for some time, perhaps for as long as we live. For those who have not heard me say this regarding air travel,individuals should avail themselves of the travel services the company is offering in the way of guidance for those that are traveling and only travel by air for essential matters( until further notice). In addition, anyone who is currently  uncomfortable with the notion of air travel  need not do so...we will work around this for as long as the need exists. The company has also provided information on the availability of counseling services should anyone have the need- please contact HR or the Benefits Group for further information.
     A final couple of notes: If there is a silver lining in the events of September 11th, it is the kindness, generosity, and humanity it brings out in the rest of us...I have seen this play out in untold ways in our "group",both in London and at home,  over the last nine days , including( to a person) the absence of any hint of bias being shown towards the individual in our group who is an "Arab American" and a Muslim, Amr Ibrahim. My high regard and respect for the Government Affairs group and for each individual  has been validated many times over  during the past nine days. Thank you very much.--- Rick Shapiro
