Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to play Sunday against Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as!

oubtful with a groin injury. "But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis) will come back and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's playing in the right games." Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His health status makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will likely start for Bettis.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3213&key=12436&"><B>Skip Hicks</B></A>, RB TEN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Titans Head Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that he plans to give Hicks more work over the final three games of the season, according to the <I>Nashville Tennessean</I>
. "We're going to play Skip more," Fisher said. "We're going to play Skip, if at all possible, as much as he played [Sunday] night … But I also want to get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This development will limit George's production over the final three weeks, making him a risky start.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3213&key=1069&"><B>Steve McNair</B></A>, QB TEN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>McNair will miss Tuesday's practice due to tightness in his lower back which hampered him during Sunday's game against Green Bay. The injury is unrelated to his 1999 surgery to repair a disc in his lower back, and he should return to practice on Wednesday. Provided McNair heals over the next couple of days, he's a safe start for Week 15.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?scri!

His status for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear, but he's only a marginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3213&key=1070&"><B>Gus Frerotte</B></A>, QB DEN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on injured reserve due to a separated shoulder which might require surgery. Brian Griese will probably start for the remainder of the season, with Jarious Jackson serving as his backup.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

He wasn't a reliable weekly starter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay and Jamel White, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time the rest of the way if Jackson is out.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3213&key=1681&"><B>Corey Dillon</B></A>, RB CIN - Frank <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltim!
or!

Don't reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based on the Ravens' strong rush defense.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3213&key=1025&"><B>Scott Mitchell</B></A>, QB CIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Mitchell could get the start Sunday against Baltimore due to Jon Kitna's strained ligament in the middle finger of his throwing hand. Whether Mitchell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect either QB to be worth starting in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3213&key=133415&"><B>Akili Smith</B></A>, QB CIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
The Bengals placed Smith on injured reserve with a hamstring injury Tuesday, officially ending his season. He will likely need surgery to reattach the muscle group in his hamstring to the bone. Jon Kitna will probably start in his place the rest of the season if he's healthy, but we don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the rest of the year anyway.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3213&key=1177&"><B>Terry Allen</B></A>, RB BAL - Tori <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnati after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10 carries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three after he recovered from a hand injury. None of the three is a worthy starter in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.</FONT></FONT><!

While Brees is not expected to play, he may see some playing time in the Week 16 finale against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player during the Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility he could sit in favor of Brees at any time.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3213&key=1645&"><B>Priest Holmes</B></A>, RB KC - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibly Thursday due to a sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable for Sunday's game against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his status before you consider using him this week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3213&key=187388&"><B>Bubba Franks</B></A>, TE GB - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/17/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Franks suffered ankle and tailbone injuries on Sunday.
