NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Terry Glenn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 12/05/01
Glenn did not report to practice on Wednesday. It is uclear if and when he will play for the Patriots again.

Eddie Kennison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1296&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/05/01
Kennison might see some limited action against the Raiders this week. Even if he plays extensively at some point, Kennison will have minimal Fantasy value.

Doug Brien <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=! 14! 696.2&random=368&key=1393&>, K - Free Agent Updated 12/05/01
Brien was signed by The Colts. With Mike Vanderjagt nursing a sore back, Brien will be used on kickoffs and could see some occasional field-goal work. He will be an accurate, reliable Fantasy choice if Vanderjagt misses any playing time.

Dave Moore <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1369&>, TE TB - Free Agent Updated 12/05/01
An MRI on Moore's hip was negative, but he may still miss Sunday's game against Detroit. The Bucs activated Mike Roberg from the practice squad as a precaution. Don't use Moore this week.

Anthony Thomas <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=235! 24! 8&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 12/05/01
Thomas will test his strained hamstring in full-speed practice Wednesday. "We want to try to get him healthy," Coach Dick Jauron told the Chicago Tribune. "Hopefully by resting him for two weeks we'll have him back healthy. And James [Allen] has done an outstanding job in the meantime. If [Thomas] is not ready to go, we're comfortable with it." Monitor Thomas' progress before you make a final decision on starting a Chicago RB this week.

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Watters is close to returning from a shoulder injury, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. "The plan is (for Ricky) to practice ! th! is week. Whether he can play this Sunday, that's another question," coach and general manager Mike Holmgren said. It is unclear whether Watters will take back the starting job from Shaun Alexander, although we think it's unlikely he will. However, Watters could take away carries from Alexander, hurting his Fantasy value during the most important weeks of the season.

Jon Ritchie <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=12652&>, RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Ritchie is expected to miss Sunday's game against Kansas City, and perhaps more, due to a sprained ankle. He will be replaced at fullback by Zack Crockett, who often gets goal-line chances.

Keith P! oo! le <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1779&> , WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Poole could miss his second straight game Sunday against Seattle due to bruised ribs. He's merely a marginal Fantasy player to begin with, so don't use him if there is any question whether he will play.

Rod Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 12/04/01
Smith is questionable for Sunday's game against Seattle due to his sprained left ankle. He will test the injury at practice on Wednesday, so monitor his progress before you make a decision on using him this week.

Dominic Rhodes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=236986&>, RB IND - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Rhodes is recovering from a srained right wrist and a low back bruise. However, The Indianapolis Star reports that he is expected to play in Monday's game. 

James McKnight <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
McKnight suffered a rib injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play Monday. The Miami Herald reports that he will resume practicing on Wednesday. 

Chris Chambers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Chambers is expected to practice Wednes! da! y and The Miami Herald reports that he will play Monday. Chambers is recovering from a rib injury he suffered in Sunday's game. 

James Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Hunter Updated 12/04/01
Jackson, still recovering from an ankle injury, might play in Sunday's game against New England. The Akron Beacon Journal reports that he was held out of last Sunday's game in an effort to get him healthy for the last five matchups. 

Randy Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 12/04/01
Moss suffered a bruised right elbow during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh.! T! he injury isn't serious, however, and he is expected to start in Week 13 against Tennessee. 

Cameron Cleeland <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=12277&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Cleeland, who has missed several weeks due to an ankle injury, is expected to return this week against Atlanta. In fact, the Times Picayune is reporting that Cleeland is probable for the contest. If you need a tight end for Week 13, Cleeland is definitely an option, barring any setbacks. 

Kris Mangum <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1672&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Mangum's neck injury may be more serious than what was originally thought. He continues to be hampered by the injury, and will be evaluated on a day to day basis. 

Tyrone Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1499&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Davis was activated for Monday night's game against Jacksonville. He saw limited playing time, and won't make much of an impact from a Fantasy perspective. 

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Banks suffered an ankle injury during Sunday's 20-10 loss to Dallas. However, he is expected to practice on Wednesday and w! il! l remain Washington's starting quarterback in Week 13 vs. Arizona. 

Stephen Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
According to the Washington Post, Alexander (broken fibula) is likely out for the remainder of the 2001 season. He suffered the injury during Sunday's 20-10 loss to Dallas, and will be replaced by Walter Rasby and Zeron Flemister. 

Dave Moore <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1369&>, TE TB - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Moore underwent an MRI on his injured hip on Monday, and coach Tony Dungy said that he could miss Sunday's game against Detroit. Todd Yoder would start in Moore's absence, but neither player has much Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues. 

Kevan Barlow <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 12/04/01
Barlow, who missed Sunday's game against Buffalo due to a shoulder injury, is expected to return to practice on Wednesday. He'll play in Week 13 barring any setbacks, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team. 

Terrell Owens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 12/04/01
Owens, who is still dealing with both foot and ankle injuries, will be in the starting lineup for the Niners on Sunday against St. Louis. Owens said he's still not 100 percent healthy but that he "did better than I expected" in Sunday's 35-0 win over Buffalo. 

Jeff Thomason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1333&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Thomason is still nursing a hyperextended knee, and will likely miss practice this week. He's doubtful for Sunday's game against San Diego. 

Freddie Mitchell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=235231&>, WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
According to published reports, Mitchell is close to replacing Todd Pinkston as Philadelphia's No. 2 receiver. "They both play about the equal number of plays," coach Andy Reid said. "Every week we're giving Freddie more responsibility, and he's coming along very well. He's the No. 2 wideout [behind Pinkston] at that position right now." If you're in a deeper league and need a wideout, Mitchell may be worth taking a chance on. 

Mike Vanderjagt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=12783&>, K IND - Hunter Updated 12/04/01
Vanderjagt is expected to play this weekend, according to published reports. He suffered a pulled back muscle in Sunday's game. 

Daun! te! Culpepper <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 12/04/01
Culpepper's status for this weekend's contest against Tennessee is uncertain at this time. "If his knee is in better shape, then he'll play," Green told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. "If it's not, then he probably will not." Todd Bouman, who threw two late touchdowns against Pittsburgh, would start in Culpepper's absence. 

Anthony Thomas <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 12/04/01
According to the Chicago Daily Herald, Thomas should be back in the starting lineup this weekend. He will be limited in practice all week, but barring any setbacks he should be able to play against Green Bay. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Walls, who suffered a hyperextended ankle on Sunday, should be able to return to practice by Thursday. He's questionable for Sunday's game at Buffalo at this point, but he should be able to play barring any setbacks. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/04/01
Bettis, the NFL's rushing leader, most likely will miss Pittsburgh's game against the New York Jets on Sunday because of groin and hip injuries. Bettis was listed Tuesday as doubtful, meaning there is a 25 percent chance he could play. Coach Bill! C! owher said even that might be overestimating his chances. "We'll see how he is by the end of the week but, by listing him as doubtful, you can see where I'm heading," Cowher said. If Bettis can't play, he would be replaced by Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala and Amos Zereoue. Fuamatu-Ma'afala had 12 carries for 74 yards Sunday. 

Chris Chandler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
According to Head Coach Dan Reeves, Chandler's injured ankle will be evaluated in practice on Wednesday. "According to the doctor, we've got a chance with Chris this week," Reeves said. "There wasn't a lot of swelling. It's going to be sore. Wednesday is going to be the key for him." Michael Vick would start against New Orleans if Chandler can't go.

Teams, Player News 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Frank Player News

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1236&>, Active WR Updated 11/30/01
Despite his recent troubles off the field, Smith is still one of the best receivers. Look for him to catch some passes this week and be a solid No. 2 wideout. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1859&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/30/01
Thrash suffered a bruised kneecap during Thursday's game against Kansas City. "We really don't know what that is," coach Andy Reid told the Philadelphia Inquirer. "He hurt it earlier in the game and went back out. We'll check on that." Thrash had five catches for 65 yards in Philly's 23-10 victory. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1028&>, Active QB Updated 11/29/01
Favre practiced Wednesday and reported improvement in the sore back that had hampered him after Week 11. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Jacksonville, and you shouldn't be afraid to start him in your Fantasy league this week.

Garrison Hearst <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1164&>, Active RB Updated 11/29/01
Hearst had 106 yards rushing and two touchdowns against Indianapolis on Sunday. Hearst has had three consecutive solid weeks, and is proving his worth as a Fantasy player. Buffalo's defense has been pretty shaky against the run, so starting Hearst in Week 12 is advisable. 

Terance Mathis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1189&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/29/01
Mathis has been a huge disappointment this season, catching only 30 passes for 315 yards. He'll have no better luck against CB Aeneas Williams and the Rams in Week 12, so be sure to reserve him. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1294&>, Active WR Updated 11/29/01
Bruce may not be having his best statistical season, but he's still worth starting on a weekly basis. He has four touchdowns in his last three games vs. Atlanta, so be sure to get him into your starting lineup. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1593&>, Active WR Updated 11/29/01
Schroeder seems to have fallen out of favor with Brett Favre in recent weeks, and his numbers have reflected it. However, his potential to post solid numbers is much too hard to ignore for most Fantasy owners, so taking a gamble that he and Favre will get back on the same page is advisable. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=188183&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/29/01
Smith is dealing with both neck and ankle injuries, but he was able to practice on Wednesday. He has been losing carries to Bob Christian in recent weeks, however, and playing against a tough Rams' defense doesn't bode well for his chances for Fantasy success. 

Olandis Gary <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=133291&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/26/01
The Broncos placed Gary on injured reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman to the active roster. This officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursday. Drop him from your roster.

Jake Plummer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1003&>, Reserve QB Updated 11/25/01
Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best. 

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1681&>, Active RB Updated 11/21/01
Definitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up against the Browns on Sunday. He has a great career record against Cleveland (678 rushing yards, five rushing TDs in five games). Dillon should remain in your active lineup week in and week out in any league.

Titans <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=29&>, Active DT Updated 11/06/01
Linebacker Randall Godfrey suffered torn cartilage in his left knee during Sunday's win over Jacksonville. He'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and will be listed as questionable for Monday's game against Baltimore. 

Dorsey Levens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1107&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

David Akers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1666&>, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.
