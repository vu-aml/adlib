Mark:  I spoke with Richard this afternoon briefly.   Please let me know if there is anything we can do to assist you or your other counsel on anything or if you just want to bounce any ideas around.  In light of our relationship with the company, we obviously want to do whatever we can to help out at this difficult time.  John
