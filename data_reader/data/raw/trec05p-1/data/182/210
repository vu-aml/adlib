I am available at your convenience.  I do think we can accomplish a lot but, like you, am concerned with Marketing's expectations.  I am not sure of where exactly they are pulling their information.

	Rick, FYI.  I am concerned about the expectation from Marketing vs. what we can accomplish
	before January 1.  Are you OK with the way all the emails are going back and forth?  
	Would you have some time this morning to discuss?  Thanks. Lynn
