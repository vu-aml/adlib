FROM:DR.YERIMA MUSA

Dear Sir,
    ASSISTANCE REQUIRED FOR ACQUISITION OF ESTATE
I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates or landed 
properties in your country on behalf of the Director of Contracts and 
Finance Allocations of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in
Nigeria.
Considering his very strategic and influential
position, he would want the transaction to be as
strictly confidential as possible. He further wants his identity to
remain undisclosed at least for now, untill the completion of the
transaction. Hence our desire to have an overseas agent.
I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as
our overseas agent in order to actualize this transaction.The deal, in
brief, is that the funds with which we intend to carry out our proposed
investments in your country is presently in a coded account at the
Nigerian Apex Bank (i.e. the Central Bank of Nigeria) and we need your
assistance to transfer the funds to your country in a convenient bank
account that will be provided by you before we can put the funds into
use in your country. For this, you shall be considered to have executed
a contract for the Federal Ministry of 
Works and Housing in Nigeria for which payment should be effected to you
by the Ministry, The contract sum of which shall run into US$17.4 
Million,  of  which your share shall be 20% if you agree to be our
overseas agent.
As soon as payment is effected, and the amount
mentioned above is successfully transferred into your account, we intend
to use our own share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this  too you
shall also serve as our agent. In the light of this, I would like you to
forward to me the following information:
1. Your company name and address if any
2. Your personal fax number
3. Your personal telephone number  for easy
communication.
You are requested to communicate your acceptance of this proposal
through my above stated email address after which we shall discuss in
details the modalities for seeing this transaction through.
Your quick response will be highly appreciated. Thank you in
anticipation of your cooperation.
Yours faithfully,
DR.YERIMA MUSA.
