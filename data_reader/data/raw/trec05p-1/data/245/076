From: Mrs.Amira Burhan

Dear Beloved,

 I am the above named person whom is now undergoing medical treatment. And I =
was married to Mr. Farid Burhan who worked with the Malaysia Embassy in Omar =
for nine years before he died in the year 2003. My Husband also served in =
Ireland,Uk and Russia. 

 We were married for Twenty-Two years without a child.He died after a brief =
illness that lasted for only four days.Before his death we were both born =
again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-
marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is =
against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US$35.5 =
Million (Thirty-Five Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) with one =
finance/security company in Europe. 

Presently,this money is still with the
Finance/Security Company.Recently,my Doctor told me that I may not last for =
the next three months due to my cancer problem.Having known my condition I =
decided to donate this fund to church or better still a christian individual =
that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct.I want a church =
or
individual that will use this to fund churches, orphanages and widows and to =
also propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is =
maintained.The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that =
giveth. 

 I took this decision because I dont have any child that will inherit this =
money  and moreso for the fact that i have given my life to God and humanity. =
my Husband's relatives are not Christians and most importantly they are only =
interested in distroying any thing my husband lived for and I dont want my =
husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers.I dont want a =
situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner,hence the reason =
for taking this bold decision.I am not afraid of death because I know where I =
am going when i die.I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. 

Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my =
peace.I dont need any telephone communication in this regard because of my =
health,and because of the presence of my Husband,s relatives around me =
always.I dont want them to know about this development. Please contact me via =
 this email(amira_burhan@yahoo.com.hk)

With God all things are possible.As soon as I receive your reply I shall give =
you the contact of our Lawyer in Europe who will give you all the necessary =
assistance.I will also through our Lawyer issue you a letter of authority =
that will empower you as the original- beneficiary of this fund.

I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my =
shephard.My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. 

 Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and =
truth.Please always be prayerful all through your life. 

Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or =
christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will =
act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you. 

Yours in Christ,
Mrs.Amira Burhan
BLESS THE CHILDREN OF GOD!!!
