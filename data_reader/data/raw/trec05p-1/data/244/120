Assuming all of what is below is all correct, it appears that TDC is
entitled to payment.  The question with administrative priority is whether
the the estate benefitted.  If we took the gas, I assume that we did.
THanks.

3/6/02 2:30 PM just spoke with Louis Schott (504-529-3630  Sr. Vice
President & General Counsel for TDC) - TDC has not filed a claim with the
courts at this time.  TDC is trying to avoid the administrative expense and
expects to be paid $203,196.00.  I told him I would call him back Friday
afternoon and give him a status update.  Please let me know what I can tell
him.  This was an ENA deal.

>     Summary:  TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00
from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001
(sitara deal #1143983).  TDC stated that it would "file a claim for
administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all
other necessary relief against ENA" if ENA did not remit payment by the
close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it
appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.
>
>     Kay, Ed, Question:  I have not contacted TDC to determine if they
have filed a claim with the court.  Would that have any impact on making a
payment to TDC?  Should I contact TDC?
>
>
>     Calculation of Post-Petition Payment using Dec 3 as Post-Petition day
>     Gas scheduled Dec 3-24, 26-31 = 28 days, volume = 3,000 dth per day
>     28 x 3,000 x $2.419 = $203,196.00

>           I need your expertise.  If ENA nominated this gas, and I think
we did based on what I see in Unify, then we are supposed to pay for it.
So I just need to verify with you  we TOOK this gas by nominating it.
