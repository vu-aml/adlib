Joan,
Many thanks for the prompt follow up.

As discussed, we have been retained by a telecommunications company to
find the following:
- Product Managers
- Project Managers
- a Program Manager to lead their PMO (Project Management Office)

Our client operates in the CLEC and ILEC spaces.

You now have my e-mail address.  My contact information is provided
