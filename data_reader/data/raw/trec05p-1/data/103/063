IV. TRAVEL COLUMNS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

10. CAN THEY KICK ME OFF A FLIGHT?

A flight attendant claims she was bumped by a passenger's bag,
then removes that passenger for not apologizing. Can she do that?
Christopher Elliott responds in "The Travel Troubleshooter," and
says the real issue may be carry-on luggage.

11. WHY YOU MIGHT DRIVE TO YOUR NEXT CRUISE

Faced with potential passengers who don't necessarily want to fly
to meet their ships or to sail in European and Mediterranean waters,
cruise lines try a double strategy. "Real Traveler" Anita Dunham-Potter

lays out some "Drive & Cruise" options and closer-to-home itineraries.

12. GOING AHEAD WITH A CRUISE

These days, just deciding to go ahead with a long-planned cruise
causes some travelers to take an extra deep breath. Eileen Ogintz
looks at the importance of families to cruise lines, cruise security,
and the buyer's market in "Taking the Kids."

13. BAD TIMES FOR TRAVEL INSURANCE

Does trip-cancellation insurance cover your fear of terrorism after
September 11? You may be surprised at the limited options available
today, and the new limitations on the way. Ed Perkins spells it out
in "On Travel."
