Regardless of your position on using or having guns, this is one of the

> military installation.
> >
> > FEMALE INTERVIEWER: So, General Reinwald, what things are you going to
> teach  these young boys when they visit your base?
> >
> > GENERAL REINWALD: We're going to teach them climbing, canoeing, archery,
> and  shooting.
> >
> > FEMALE INTERVIEWER: Shooting! That's a bit irresponsible, isn't it?
> >
> > GENERAL REINWALD: I don't see why, they'll be properly supervised on the

> >
> > FEMALE INTERVIEWER: Don't you admit that this is a terribly dangerous

> >
> > GENERAL REINWALD: I don't see how. We will be teaching them proper rifle
