Cara,

I apologize for not sending out an email last week; I have been busy with the Consolidated Position Manager.  I did release new versions of both Pre-Schedule and Path Confirmation.

According to Asem the new version of PreSchedule:
Dumps summary report to excel
Edit box shown for looking at cells with large values

	Outstanding issues:
What to do with records with  'WEEK' specified in SCHED_TERM field for there is no 'WEEK' section in the physicalandbookoutsummary excel report file.  I have fired off an email to Cara asking for assistance on this matter. - determined that should be treated as daily

	Notes:
The application will look in the follow places for the PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54.xls file if user launching app has no existing profile in pwr_user_default_settings (fSUMMARYLOCATION) 
		i.e. User is WEST trader and in following DB environments:
			pwrstage[n/p]:	M:\Electric\Schedule\Process\WEST\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54WestTest.xls
			pwrprod:	O:\Portland\WestDesk\SCHEDULING\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54WestProd.xls
A pre-existing excel report must exist in location for appending to occur



According to Vish the new version of Path Confirmation:
	Path Confirmations Report
Fixed, Press Enter or Select the date from the drop down Pulling up the proper date with the calendar is slow when there is data populated into the system. We need to make sure that the selection process does not get incrementally slower with each additional day of data that is added.
Log Text displays in clean format
POR/POD can be easy to pick up


	Path Cuts
Fixed  Need to filter Region list for cuts by trading desk (East or West).
Fixed Allow hour ranges in the Hour # field specifically in HE 0000 (military) format (e.g.  0200-0400 or 1000-1400).
Fixed In the cut view, the region is still the cumbersome drop down list. This needs to be a forced choice option, like the hour-ahead vs. real-time selection.  The choices for the west are : WSCC-S, WSCC-N, Rockies, Northwest, California. Corry will be able to provide his region choices.
Provided an option to easily create a new path cut by selecting Copy Path Cut button and change the values needed
Taking care of validation while cutting the hour


Let me know if you find any problems.

Thanks,
Will

Good Morning Will,

I haven't heard anything new being released lately, and just wanted to check in to see when I should expect the next release for testing. If the old data is blown away when the new release comes out, I will just run the same data.

Thanks,

Cara
