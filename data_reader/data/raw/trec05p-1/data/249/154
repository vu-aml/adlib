It was reported in the morning meeting today that NGPL Trailblazer will be having an outage April 9,10&11, at which time there will be no gas available to flow at the  trailblazer interconnect. Jerry would you check with Beatrice and see if there is anything we need to plan on our side at this time.

Thanks 
Gary
