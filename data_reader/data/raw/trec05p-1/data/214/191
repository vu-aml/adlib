<p>KSignPassOne is a type of Single Sign On (SSO) solution<br>
  which safely and efficiently manages numerous user names<br>
  and passwords for each end-user by applying appropriate<br>
  security functions and digital certificates. The solution<br>
  then automatically processes login by detecting login page<br>
  when accessing a certain website or client/server<br>
  environment on the Internet.</p>
<p>Enterprises and public institutions will be able to<br>
  provide their employees with easy access to complex<br>
  networks and websites on the Internet that previously<br>
  required unique user names and password authentication<br>
  at different locations. With KSignPassOne's central<br>
  management of user names and passwords, the user will<br>
  be able to automatically login, resulting in dramatic<br>
  savings in effort and time. KSign is planning to supply<br>
  the product to Japanese market through an exclusive<br>
  distributor.</p>
