Anthrax anxiety boosts CDC Web site

Traffic to the Web site of the Centers for Disease Control more 
than doubled in the past week as terrorist-related concerns 
drove Web users to search for information. Nielsen/NetRatings  
reported that 515,000 people visited CDC.gov during the week 
ending Oct. 14, compared to 236,000 the previous week. More than 
59% of the visitors looked at pages containing information on 
the symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of anthrax. An even 
greater rise was experienced by the Department of Justice Web 
site. NetRatings reported 908,000 visitors to the site, almost 
five times the number the previous week, many of them looking at 
pictures of suspects wanted for terrorism. "The need for 
reliable information is critical, especially when facts of 
recent events may be inaccurately reported," said Allen Weiner, 
principal analyst at NetRatings.

Another Web site experiencing a sharp rise last week was Rush 
Limbaugh's rushlimbaugh.com. The talk show host's announcement 
of his hearing impairment was followed by his Web site's 
garnering an audience of 974,000, triple that of the week ending 
Oct. 7, according to Jupiter Media Metrix.

Cerf sees 2.2 billion Netizens

The man who helped create the Internet Protocol, Vinton Cerf, 
expects 2.2 billion people worldwide will be using the Internet 
by the end of the decade. In an interview with the Medill News 
Service, Cerf also spoke of the possibility of an "intergalactic 
Internet." Looking into the future, Cerf predicted scales that 
will report your weight not only to your online medical file, 
but also to the refrigerator; and "Internet-enabled socks" that 
can find their lost mates. He also said the development of 
Web-enabled cell phones and pagers, and video games allowing 
players to compete even though they are in different cities, 
will further expand the market and usefulness of the Web.

AOL unit testing life with out Explorer

A new version of software for AOL Time Warner's  CompuServe 
service is being tested, leading to speculation the next version 
of the product will not rely on Microsoft's  Internet Explorer 
as its browser. Explorer has been the service's browser, and is 
also used by the America Online software. An AOL spokeswoman 
confirmed to CNET that the new Compuserve software utilizes 
browser technology from the company's Netscape Communications 
unit. However, she said, "no decisions as to what will be in the 
final CompuServe client or when that will be," have been made.
