Please take a look at these maps and let me know what you think so that I can let the map guys know if we want to make any changes.
Thanks.

Lindsay,

I have saved the requested Energy Atlas maps on:  O:\_Dropbox\fraley\PDF.zip.  I have included all of them except for Ohio-IOU, Ohio-LDC, Ontario (Central), and Ontario (Western).  I am having some technical problems with exporting .PDF's for these files.  Please look them over and let me know what you think.  

Thanks and have a great weekend.
