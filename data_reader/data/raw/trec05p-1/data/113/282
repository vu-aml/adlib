According to our database the Atlantic Richfield and BP are not related, but after searching for BP subsidiaries I was able to uncover that the two are related. I also believe that Atlatic Richflied purchases petroleum-related products as well so please add that to the list of products.
I left a copy the spreadsheet with the added information on the desk you were using but I will attach a copy to this e-mail. The guarantor is listed next to the counterparty. Please let me know how I can help.

BP wants to add Atlantic Richfield Company to the netting agreement.
Apparently, Atlantic Richfield Company owns the Calciner unit at the Carson
Refinery in California and sells 30 MW of power to Enron Power Marketing.

Please let me know your response.

Very truly yours,

Mr. Dixon:

Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary
list of the agreements to be under the BP Master Netting Agreement.
Since we don't own 100% of EOTT, any master netting agreement involving
EOTT will not be under this master netting agreement.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.
