The Bankruptcy Court order authorizing the Key Employee Retention, Liquidation Incentive and Severance Plan (the "KERP") requires that, before receiving any payment under the KERP, each participant certify that he or she has not engaged in insider trading of the Company's stock.  To receive any KERP payment, you must print, complete, and return the attached certificate. 
 
If you wish to review Enron's policy regarding insider trading, you can find the Securities Trades by Company Personnel section of the Code of Ethics at: 
<<<http://home.enron.com/resources/policies/code_of_ethics/code_of_ethics100600.pdf >>>
  
To ensure that you receive your first payment, you should:
Completely and legibly fill out the form.
Deliver it to the designated receptacle in the lobby on the 16th floor by  no later than 5:00 p.m., Monday, June 3, 2002.
Do not drop it in the mail.

Unfortunately, late forms will result in a delay in payment.  Thank you for your hard work and continued commitment to Enron.
