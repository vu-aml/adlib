Daren, 

I am trying to get some payments out to Williams for old months 11/2000 and 1/2001 but global counterparty said this deal should have Black Marlin Pipeline Company Inc. instead of Black Marlin Pipeline Company effective 3/99.  The Black Marlin Pipeline Company was for an internal record (when it was an Enron entity).
