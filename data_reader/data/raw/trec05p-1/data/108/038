Rob,

I really appreciate your quick response and you calling back as soon as
you had some news on my contracts today.

I was taking an executive course all week at Wharton and I have to admit
I was not fully aware until reading the WSJ today of the full dimensions
of what Enron is going through.

I hope everything is well with you and I will give you a call on Monday
to catch up on everything.

All the best,

Diomedes.

D -

Thanks for the note.  With all due respect, I don't think things have
ever
been like this at Enron.  In any event, the company owes you a response
and
I'll do my best to find out what's going on.

Thanks.

   Rob,

   Thanks. I am copying Jim on the entire exchange.

   I realize things are hectic at Enron but they have been for some time
   now and my payments can no longer be delayed. I think no one wants to
   assume responsibility for this and that's why I am writing to you and
   Jim because the delay is really reaching break point from my
standpoint.
   These are contractually agreed upon payments and they are not days or
   weeks late but MANY MONTHS late. I really need to receive the
payments
   in a matter of days.

   All the best and look forward to hearing from you.

   Diomedes.

   Dio -

   I think Jim's email address is jim.derrick@enron.com.  I haven't
heard
   back
   from Mary Joyce on any of this.  In fairness to her, things are a
little
   hectic over here right now.  Thanks.

   Rob

      Rob,

      I've not been able to follow this to Jim ?I must be misspelling
his
      name. Can you please do so and also send me his email address?

      Thanks,

      Diomedes.

      Jim and Rob,

      I hope you are both doing well. I realize that you must both be
      extremely busy with other more important issues but I find myself
in
   a
      position that I HAVE to raise the issue described in the email
below
   to
      your direct attention. The email is self explanatory but the
bottom
   line
      is that not only has Enron failed to make payments that are due to
me
      and to one of my companies for MONTHS now but  the company is not
   even
      responding to my requests for information.

      I would highly appreciate it if you advised me on the best way to
   handle
      this, i.e WHO do I need to talk to who has the decision authority
to
      make the payments and give me answers. I stress once more that the
      unjustified delays by Enron in making these payments is already
   causing
      me serious  problems and potential losses.

      I look forward to your response.

      Thanks and hope to see you soon.

      Diomedes.

      Mary Joyce,

      I hope all is well with you.

      I am contacting you regarding a number of late payments by Enron
   which
      have now become urgent from my standpoint. These payments refer to
      contractual obligations between ECI (one of my affiliate
companies)
   and
      Enron and to the Employment Contract between Enron and myself. The
      payments have been invoiced and they are months late now.

      After questioning John Novak about the status of these payments
   (after
      leaving Enron I was told by Rob Walls to send all invoices related
to
      the ECI and to my agreement with Enron to John Novak in Enron
South
      America) I received a voice mail from Pam Buttler, who I believe
   works
      with you, informing me that I would have to wait until early
   November,
      maybe even until late November as the "changes in management at
Enron
      require that all contracts be reviewed by the Compensation
Committee
      which would convene in early or late November".

      As soon as I received this message last Wednesday I left a message
   with
      Pam and also a voice mail with you and I subsequently left two
   messages
      with your assistant asking you to contact me urgently regarding
this
      very serious matter but as I have not heard from you I am writing
   this
      email to make sure that my position is clear.

      These payments are due by Enron based on existing contracts and I
see
   no
      reason why I have to wait for a review by an internal Compensation
      Committee. These payments are already significantly late and I
have
   been
      extremely patient with continuous delays in payments due to me by
   Enron
      up to now. Moreover I have repeatedly let Enron know that I am in
the
      process of closing a transaction which depends on receiving these
      payments, otherwise I would incur costs by unwinding other
positions
      that I have. I need these payments to be made no later than
   Wednesday,
      October 24.

      Please inform me of Enron's intents so that I can take all the
      appropriate steps to enforce my contractual rights.

      I look forward to hearing from you,

      Regards,


      Diomedes Christodoulou.
