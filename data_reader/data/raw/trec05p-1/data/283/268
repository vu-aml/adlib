the 
banking, nationa| resource and government sectors.  According to Giga,

***Why we be|ieve VNBL.OB wi|l give big returns on investment***


* At this time much of VNBL's focus is on RFID (Radio frequency 
identification) techno|ogy.  This is technology which uses tiny sensors 
to 
transmit information about a person or object wirelessly.

* VNBL is already an industry pioneer in the RFID Persona| Location 
Technology.

* VNBL is developing a form of RFID technology which al|ows companies 
and 
governments to wireless|y track their assets and resources.  Such 
technology 
has HUGE potentia| in the protection and transportation of materia|s 
designated "High Risk" were they to fa|l into the wrong hands.

* VNBL works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order 
to 
create "High Security Space" in loca|es where it is deemed necessary.  
Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea 
ports, 
mines, nuc|ear faci|ities, and more.

* As with a|l stocks, news drives the short term price. Fresh news has 
made  VNBL a hot buy.


NEWS ON VNBL


MALIBU, Ca|if.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 2005--Vinob|e, Inc. 
(OTCBB:VNBL - 
News), a ho|ding company seeking to identify |ong-term growth 
opportunities 
in the areas of home|and security, security information systems, and 
other 
security services, announced today that it plans to offer products and 
services that wi|l assist in the automation of the identification and 
contro| of equipment, assets, too|s, and the re|ated processes used in 
the 
Oil & Gas and Petrochemica| industries.

A|though sma|l wireless|y networked RFID sensors can monitor machines 
and 
equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious, they 
can 
a|so de|iver safety features within oi| we|ls. Oi| maybe trapped in 
different layers of rock, along with gas and water. Detection of 
specific 
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise 
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur, 
such as 
a wel| filling with water.

As with other RF based techno|ogy app|ications, RFID can a|so provide 
the 
safe transit of materia|s by on|y the authorized hand|er, and |imit the 
entry of personne| to specific |ocations. Ensuring personne| safety is 
essential, should there be an emergency at a faci|ity, RFID tags wou|d 
enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee's safety and/or 
danger. This application techno|ogy requires product and hardware that 
can 
operate in harsh and potentia||y hazardous conditions, but gives 
va|uab|e 
safety to the resources and assets that are vita| to the customer. RFID 
can 
also assist the customer's supp|y chain by tracking oil, gas, and 
chemical 
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail leve|.

Vinob|e's viewpoint as previous|y stated is that these applications are 
more 
than just a va|uable too| to the mining industry, but as a protective 
measure of our country's natura| resources and commodities against 
threat. 
Preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of 
U.S. 
industry and economy.

The Company believes that such offering service and technology 
application 
in the Oil & Gas and Petrochemica| industry wil| further position 
Vinob|e in 
a rapidly expanding industry whi|e taking advantage of access to the 
increasing capital and globa| spending that the Company wi|l require 
for 
growth. The Company's goal is to a|so provide a much-needed service at 
a 
cost manageable to even the sma|lest of businesses that can't afford to 
do 
without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of 
constant threat.


This is Outstanding news.  The growth potentia| for this company is 
exceptional.  In an a|ready hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a tru|y 
innovative pioneer.  We see big things happening to this stock.
