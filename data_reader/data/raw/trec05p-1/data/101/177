Latest NFL Player News 

Elvis Grbac  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/25/01 
Grbac will likely be a game-time decision for Sunday's game, according to The Baltimore Sun . He threw very little in practice and is still suffering from a sore chest. Randall Cunningham will start if Grbac is unable to play. 

Randy Moss  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01 
Moss is suffering from tendonitis in his left Achilles tendon, according to The Pioneer Press . Moss missed practice Wednesday but is expected to play on Sunday. 

Tony Martin  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 10/25/01 
Martin might be ready to play when the Falcons resume their season on November 4. He has been sidelined for the past four games because of a broken collarbone but the Atlanta Journal-constitution reports that he ran routes on Wednesday and caught some passes. 

Wane McGarity  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=133355&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
The Saints have signed McGarity, who was released by the Cowboys earlier this season. McGarity has minimal value now, but he might eventually work his way into the Saints' regular rotation of receivers. 

Matt Stover  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1377&>, K BAL - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01 
Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent him from kicking off but he will be able to kick field goals, according to published reports. The injury isn't considered serious but the Ravens are considering Steve Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs. 

Eric Metcalf  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1283&>, WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
The Washington Redskins signed Metcalf on Wednesday. He will be used mostly as a returner and has minimal Fantasy value. 

Tim Biakabutuka  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1082&>, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/25/01 
Biakabutuka will be out until at least training camp with a fracture and other structural damage to his right foot. "He's not going to be really ready to do any work that would be football related until next summer," coach George Seifert said Wednesday. "Basically, it just separated," Seifert said of the top part of Biakabutuka's foot. "The ligaments, tendons and bone broke, so it all had to be put back together." Richard Huntley, who will replace Biakabutuka in the starting lineup, visited his teammate at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said the injury was far worse than he expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play again. 

James Stewart  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1116&>, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/25/01 
Stewart will probably play on Sunday against the Bengals. The Detroit Free Press reports that his ankle injury has now been identified as a bad bruise and not a sprain. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/25/01 
Chrebet, the New York Jets' top receiver, will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. He was hit in the helmet by St. Louis Rams' defensive tackle Brian Young on Sunday and left the game complaining of dizziness. It was the second consecutive week that a head injury knocked Chrebet out of the game. He left the Jets' win over Miami in the second half on Oct. 14. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Laveranues Coles will be the top receiver in his absence. Rookie Kevin Swayne will move ino the starting lineup. 

Terrell Davis  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01 
Davis disputed rumors that he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the season. "At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday," Davis said. Davis, who has missed five games this year and 29 since 1999, admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks. He remained on the scout team Wednesday as the Broncos prepared for this week's game against the New England Patriots. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report. Don't bother to start him. His abilities will be limited if he does play Sunday. 

Clint Stoerner  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Starting quarterback Anthony Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and might not play Sunday. Head coach Dave Campo said Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf, if Wright isn't ready to play. Using Stoerner in your starting lineup would be a risky move. Stoerner, a second-year player from Arkansas, has never started in the NFL. He has played in only three games, completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards and two touchdowns in his two appearances this season. 

Anthony Wright  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=134342&>, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01 
Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and coach Dave Campo indicated Wright might not play Sunday. Wright expected to have results of an MRI exam Thursday, and Campo said he wouldn't make a final decision on the quarterback's playing status for the Arizona game until after that. Campo said Clint Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Campo said there was a good chance that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Sunday. Leaf apparently hasn't been with the team long enough to merit a starting spot yet. 

Terrell Davis  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/24/01 
Davis is sufficiently healed from a knee injury, but now his lower left leg is giving him problems and will probably keep him out of action this week. X-rays revealed no stress fracture, says the Denver Post , but Davis' leg is throbbing. Mike Anderson will retain the starting job for now. If Davis is able to play, which seems unlikely, he will be very limited. 

Amani Toomer  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/24/01 
According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/24/01 
Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL. 

Chris Sanders  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear. 

Bert Emanuel  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1186&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up. 

Hines Ward  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/24/01 
Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee. 

Germane Crowell  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=12306&>, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/24/01 
The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season. 

Santana Moss  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
The New York Daily News says there is still a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2. 

Brett Favre  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1028&>, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/24/01 
Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight. 

Marvin Minnis  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=235122&>, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/24/01 
Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still working with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which player will start on Thursday against the Colts. 

Larry Foster  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=188491&>, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 10/24/01 
According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks. 

Marcus Robinson  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1676&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league. 

Neil Rackers  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=187627&>, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play. 

Todd Pinkston  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=187621&>, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/24/01 
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis. 

Ron Dixon  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week. 

Joe Jurevicius  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=12484&>, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/24/01 
Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines. 

Reggie Swinton  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. "He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be available," said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence. 

Joey Galloway  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/24/01 
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. "We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days," said head coach Dave Campo.

Randy Moss  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=12576&>, Active WR Updated 10/25/01 
Moss is suffering from tendonitis in his left Achilles tendon, according to The Pioneer Press . Moss missed practice Wednesday but is expected to play on Sunday. 

Matt Stover  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1377&>, Active K Updated 10/25/01 
Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent him from kicking off but he will be able to kick field goals, according to published reports. The injury isn't considered serious but the Ravens are considering Steve Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs. 

Hines Ward  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=12795&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/24/01 
Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee.

Joey Galloway  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1286&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/24/01 
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. "We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days," said head coach Dave Campo. 

Kevin Dyson  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=12342&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/23/01 
Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Tony Richardson  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1471&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/22/01 
Richardson (shoulder) did play against the Cardinals. He was used in goal-line packages and had one carry and one reception for 24 total yards. He will probably be used sparingly as a runner now that Priest Holmes has clearly emerged as a featured back.

Tiki Barber  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1782&>, Active RB Updated 10/22/01 
Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.

Tim Couch  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=133260&>, Reserve QB Updated 10/19/01 
Couch probably won't complete a high percentage of his passes but should throw at least one TD pass. Consider benching him this week if you have a QB on your roster that has a more favorable matchup. 

Wesley Walls  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1321&>, Active TE Updated 10/18/01 
Walls is proving that he is still one of the best tight ends in the league Fantasy-wise. Unless you have a better option, Walls is a must-start against Washington. 

Terrell Owens  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1290&>, Active WR Updated 10/14/01 
Owens had a super outing against Atlanta, catching nine passes for 183 yards and three TDs, including the game-winner, a 52-yarder in overtime. Owens is definitely maintaining his place among Fantasy Football's best receivers.

Saints  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=18&>, Active DT Updated 10/14/01 
Defensive end Joe Johnson (quadriceps) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Carolina. New Orleans faces a mediocre team in the Panthers this week, which makes them worth starting as a defense Fantasy-wise. 

Rich Gannon  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1034&>, Active QB Updated 10/12/01 
Gannon should have a fine game against the Colts. Indianapolis will have a lot of trouble handling wideouts Tim Brown and Jerry Rice.

Jerry Rice  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1291&>, Active WR Updated 10/12/01 
Rice should have another good outing. He should draw inexperienced Indianapolis CB David Macklin in coverage, which means Rice will definitely be a TD threat again this week.

Dwayne Carswell  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1328&>, Reserve TE Updated 10/12/01 
Carswell is a good start this week. Seattle's defense has always been vulnerable to tight ends over the middle.

Richie Anderson  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1141&>, Reserve RB Updated 08/28/01 
Anderson has returned to practice after suffering a concussion in last week's preseason game. Keep him in mind as a No. 4 Fantasy RB.
