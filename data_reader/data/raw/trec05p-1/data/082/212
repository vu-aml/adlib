Mike,

I has been a while since I spoke with you last.  My name is Trey Brown and
you might remember that I roomed with you in Ecuador and was an SFA member.
Dr. Crary gave me your e-mail address after I told him that I have a phone
interview with Enron on Thursday.  He told me that you may have some useful
information regarding phone interviews at Enron.  Any help you could
provide me would be appreciated.  It would be easiest to reach me through
e-mail today, but I can also be reached by phone at 225-229-2467.

I hope all is well with you and your work at Enron.

Thanks again,

Trey Brown
