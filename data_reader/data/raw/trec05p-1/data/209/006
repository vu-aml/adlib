The Count of Monte Cristo <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JKJ5/ref=th_em_lnch_3/2099966> 
 PG-13 <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/detail/pg-13.gif>Guy Pearce, James Caviezel 
When a dashing young sailor is betrayed by his best friend and unjustly imprisoned, his peaceful life is shattered and his beautiful fiancée stolen away. Consumed by thoughts of vengeance, he escapes from his hellish prison, transforms himself into a mysterious and wealthy French nobleman, and exacts revenge on all who wronged him. Alexandre Dumas's classic swashbuckling story gets the royal treatment in The Count of Monte Cristo <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/883072/ref=mk_del_166895_0/>, directed by Kevin Reynolds (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves) and starring James Caviezel, Guy Pearce, and Richard Harris.

The Count of Monte Cristo <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JKJ5/ref=th_em_lnch_3/2099966> 
 PG-13 <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/detail/pg-13.gif>Guy Pearce, James Caviezel 
When a dashing young sailor is betrayed by his best friend and unjustly imprisoned, his peaceful life is shattered and his beautiful fiancée stolen away. Consumed by thoughts of vengeance, he escapes from his hellish prison, transforms himself into a mysterious and wealthy French nobleman, and exacts revenge on all who wronged him. Alexandre Dumas's classic swashbuckling story gets the royal treatment in The Count of Monte Cristo <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/883072/ref=mk_del_166895_0/>, directed by Kevin Reynolds (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves) and starring James Caviezel, Guy Pearce, and Richard Harris.
