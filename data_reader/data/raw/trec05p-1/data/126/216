Could you find out if Patina has performed a gas analysis on the zone to be completed at your new well.  If/when you receive a gas analysis, our operations guys like to review this data for all new interconnects (obviously, this information is kept confidential).

Thanks.

P.S.  As we approach an "in-service date" (which is estimated to be during the first half of December), let's get together with Mark Whitt to discuss and coordinate gathering and marketing strategies.
