Lysa,

These contracts are in my inbox.  Please come by and copy them for Jeff if you have not done so already.

Dave, or Lysa:

The contracts came with a receipt.  Do either of you need it for an expense report?

Alan/Lysa,

Stewart Rosman had requested I find the DWR August energy and fuel contracts as announced in an August 17 press release.  With Lysa's assistance we have sent the processing fee and appropriate courier fees to DWR.  I am expecting that Stewart will be receiving these materials on Wednesday (8/22).

The purpose of this message is to ask that once Stewart receives these contracts and gives you (Alan) a copy, that you please make another copy and send it to Jeff Dasovich in our San Francisco Office. 

Thanks,

Dave
