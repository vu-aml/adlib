  <http://www.readersadvantage.com/newsletter/images/dot_clear.gif>	Dear Member,

This is one of our favorite times of the year. With the holiday rush behind us, and the spring still several chilly weeks away, February is a wonderful month to settle down indoors with all those books you've had on your reading list. In this issue of the Readers' Advantage Newsletter, enrich your reading with a closer look at some authors you know, and an introduction to some we think you should know about. And don't forget to look in our Great Reads section, where our fiction buyer, Sessalee Hensley, has made her choice of great fiction titles out this month. You'll find all this and more -- enough to make you almost wish February would last longer -- so cozy up and enjoy this month of reading.	   <http://www.readersadvantage.com/newsletter/images/dot_clear.gif>

Andrea Barrett, Map Studies <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0FIJ0Am>
"I came to writing fiction late, clumsily, and by a process that still remains a bit mysterious even to me," says Andrea Barrett, whose fiction speaks volumes about the ways in which we discover our true passions -- and what it means for Barrett to have found her own. Her latest, Servants of the Map, reveals profound connections between a number of characters who made appearances in her earlier books, Ship Fever and The Voyage of the Narwhal, and is highly recommended reading. We had a chance to talk with Andrea Barrett via email about her writing, her characters, and her latest work, in our exclusive Q&A <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0FIJ0Am>.

"It's All About the Madeleines," by Anne Ursu <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0GNW0A6>
"My novel, Spilling Clarence, is about memory -- or rather it's about remembering, which, I've come to believe, is a different kettle of fish," writes Anne Ursu in our exclusive essay. A selection of the 2002 Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers program, Spilling Clarence asks probing questions about the nature of memory -- and why we choose to forget. Read on to find out more about the origins of this very original debut, in "It's All About the Madeleines <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0GNW0A6>."

Biography, with Geoffrey Ward <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0HHX0A2>	   <http://www.readersadvantage.com/newsletter/images/dot_clear.gif>	Speaking of...  Exclusive <http://www.readersadvantage.com/newsletter/images/exclusive_sm.gif>
Biography, with Geoffrey Ward <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0HHX0A2>
"Nobody today comes close to Twain," says Geoffrey C. Ward, author of Mark Twain, the companion biography to the Ken Burns documentary film that appeared on PBS in January. Perhaps no author in American history has achieved the international recognition of Mark Twain -- both as a writer and celebrity. Ward, who has collaborated with Burns on legendary projects such as Jazz and The Civil War, now presents us with a wise portrait of a writer whose inimitable wit and insight into the human condition have stood the test of time. In our exclusive Q&A, we asked Geoffrey C. Ward a few questions <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0HHX0A2> about his work with Ken Burns, and about the public and private persona of Samuel Langhorne Clemens, a.k.a. Mark Twain.

A Conversation with Anthony Doerr <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0FIK0An>
"In a lot of ways, writing is a way for me to see other places in the world that I can't physically go to," says Anthony Doerr, whose debut collection, The Shell Collector, takes his readers from Tanzania to the American West, from Africa to New England. At 28, Doerr has already visited parts of the world many of us may only know through reading. And in his remarkable debut collection of stories, a selection of the 2002 Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers program, we see what truths there are to be learned when one has spent time as a stranger in a strange land. Find out more in our exclusive interview <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0FIK0An>.

Let's be honest, we love chocolate and use every holiday possible as a reason to give and gladly receive the delectable indulgence. But more than any other holiday, Valentine's Day is a great time to give chocolate - not only because of its sweet connotations, but also because of chocolate's historical association with romance. Don't miss our recommendations for some great books to sweeten the gift <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0FpW0Ae>! And, thanks to our friends at Godiva, read more about the food that has been linked to love for more than 2000 years.
