If you are not interested in getting into a College Football Bowl Pool, just please delete this message now so I don't waste any more of your time.
 
If you ARE interested, please go to this site to read about this year's College Bowl Pool:  <http://pages.prodigy.net/tjaeckle/bowlpool.htm>
 
Everything you need to know is listed there.  I did this pool for the first time last year, we had about 12 people in it, and it adds just a little more excitement to each bowl game for you.  Feel free to get some friends in if you think they might be interested.
 
Entry fee is $10.
