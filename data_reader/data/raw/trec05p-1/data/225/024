 Crude Oil Futures Drift Downward

    Crude oil futures for March delivery on the NYMEX slipped $0.14 
to $19.64 per barrel yesterday after traders had time to digest the 
latest weekly inventory statistics. API and EIA figures raised 
concerns about tepid demand and overshadowed reports that OPEC is 
moving closer to compliance with its output reductions effective on 
January 1st. The latest data from the API says that crude inventories 
grew by 978,000 barrels while the EIA reported a much larger 2.4 
million barrel increase. Although distillate and gasoline inventories 
decreased from the previous week, they remain substantially larger 
than year ago levels as do crude supplies. News that more European 
gasoline cargoes are bound for the US kept the lid on buying, traders 
said. According to the EIA demand for refined petroleum products in 
the US was 3.5% lower than a year ago. Also pressuring prices was 
word from Kuwait that its 280,000 bpd refinery which caught fire last 
week is now back on line and no further interruptions in production 
are expected. Signs of increased OPEC compliance came from reports 
that exports for last month were 22.74 million bpd, down 1.06 million 
bpd from 23.8 million the previous month. Heating oil futures for 
March delivery on the NYMEX lost $0.0085 to $0.5194 per gallon. March 
gasoline futures on the NYMEX fell $0.0013 to $0.5697 per gallon. In 
London, Brent crude oil futures for March delivery on the IPE were 
down $0.10 to $19.21 per barrel.

Conoco Replaces 432% of Production in 2001
  
Conoco added more than 1.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, 
including syncrude, to its proved global reserves in 2001, replacing 
432% of the oil and natural gas the company produced during the year. 
Conocos 2001 proved reserves were 3.58 billion BOE, including 
syncrude, up 35% from 2000. International proved reserves, which 
accounts for about 83% of Conoco's global reserves, were up 45% to 
2.98 billion BOE. Conoco's 2001 reserve additions mainly came from 
its purchase of Gulf Canada. Significant reserves also came from the 
UK, US, Vietnam and Indonesia. Conoco replaced 113% of production, 
excluding the Gulf Canada reserves and other acquisitions throughout 
the year. Conoco says that between 1997 and 2001, it replaced an 
average of 246% of production, among the best in the industry. 
Conoco's 2001 production of 281 million BOE reflects a 17% increase 
over 2000. Natural gas production was up 19% to 741 Bcf. Natural gas 
production rose from 35% of total production in 1997 to 44% in 2001. 
Conoco says that 7 out of 19 exploratory wells drilled during 2001 
resulted in discoveries, with a potential of about 100 million BOE 
from the Sutu Vang field in Vietnam. Conoco sanctioned 2 fields last 
year, the Gulf of Mexicos Magnolia field and the Sutu Den field 
offshore Vietnam. In the North Sea, Conoco made 5 discoveries close 
to existing processing and transportation facilities and is also 
drilling  at sites in the UK, Norway, the Netherlands, Western 
Canada, San Juan Basin and Indonesia that are close to processing 
facilities and pipelines. Conoco has more than 40 wells planned for 
exploration and appraisal in 2002 at an estimated cost of $500 
million.

Shells Earnings Tumble 47% in 4th Quarter


    Royal Dutch/Shell Group says 4th quarter profits tumbled by 47% 
from $3.58 billion a year ago to $1.91 billion, excluding special 
charges. Analysts had expected earnings in the $2 – $2.4 billion 
range. Shell is still sticking by its annual growth target of 3%, 
which was lowered from 5% last year. Shell's target growth rate for 
oil and natural gas production is comparable to Exxon Mobil's, but 
much lower than TotalFinaElf's 6% projection. Over the past 3 years, 
Shell has cut costs by $5.1 billion. In the last quarter, oil 
production dropped by 1%, while natural gas climbed 6%, yielding an 
overall output rise of 2%. Exploration and production earnings fell 
by 52% in the 4th quarter from $2.58 billion a year ago to $1.24 
billion, excluding special items. However, Shell is still cash rich 
with $7 billion on hand, and has a debt to equity ratio of 10%, below 
target of 20% - 30%. Shell is looking to use the money to increase 
its natural gas holdings. It plans to complete acquisition of 
refineries from ChevronTexaco in the coming weeks and expects to 
eliminate 10% - 15% of jobs to cut costs. Chemical earnings nose-
dived 69% to $33 million, excluding one-time charges and fuel sales 
profits fell 38% to $585 million. Earnings from the natural gas and 
power unit climbed by 10% in the last quarter to $172 million from 
$157 million. Shell may spend up to $5 billion to repurchase shares 
for cancellation this year, after spending $4 billion last year.

Shell to Rename Texaco Stations

    Royal Dutch/Shell Group plans to spend hundreds of millions of 
dollars to put its name on thousands of Texaco stations it is 
receiving getting from ChevronTexaco as part of a $3.86 billion 
purchase. About 13,000 Texaco stations in US will be renamed, The 
company will also give its Shell stations a new look. Shell and Saudi 
Refining also bought ChevronTexaco stakes in two refining ventures. 
ChevronTexaco got the assets when Chevron purchased Texaco last 
October for $45.8 billion. The renaming is part of a larger plan to 
reinvigorate the Shell brand in the US and improve financial 
performance.

Valero on Lookout for New Acquisitions


    After announcing that it would sell its 168,000 bpd Golden Eagle 
Refinery near San Francisco and 70 retail stations in Northern 
California to Tesoro for $1.08 billion, Valero now finds itself on 
the lookout for other properties to acquire with its proceeds. One 
asset that Valero may be considering is El Paso's 140,000 bpd Eagle 
Point, NJ refinery. El Paso has said that it will sell $2.5 billion 
in assets to shore up its balance sheet, with over half of the deals 
to be completed in the 1st quarter of this year. But Valero may hit a 
roadblock in gaining regulatory approval to buy the refinery. 
Pursuant to Valero's recent acquisition of  Ultramar Diamond 
Shamrock, the FTC required it to divest the Golden Eagle refinery. 
The FTC may balk at allowing Valero to purchase another refinery, 
even in a different part of the country, since it already has 12 
refineries in the US and Canada. Valero estimates its total refinery 
system throughput at 2 million bpd and it also has a 5,000-store 
retail network. Alternatively, Valero could spend its proceeds to 
repurchase $400 million in stock this year and to pay down debt, but 
has reiterated its interests in adding to its refining capacity. 
Valero's criteria for possible purchases is a capacity of more than 
100,000 bpd, easy access to waterborne transport and the potential 
for upgrades.

Petrobras 2001 Output Rises 

    Brazil's state oil company, Petrobras,  says daily average oil 
output in 2001 rose to 1.38 million barrels from 1.32 million in 2000 
despite the loss of its biggest rig. Natural gas production rose to 
41.03 million cubic meters per day from 38.36 million in 2000. The 
2001 record crude output exceeded Petrobras' latest production target 
for the year of 1.34 million bpd even after the sinking of the huge 
rig in March and a 5-day oil workers strike in October. The P-36, a 
180,000 bpd rig sank after a series of explosions that killed 11 crew 
members. Petrobras last year also delayed introducing another rig by 
several months due to problems in obtaining an environmental license. 
In January, it set a new domestic monthly production record of an 
average of 1.47 million bpd, 1.4% higher than in December.
