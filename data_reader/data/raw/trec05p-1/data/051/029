This awkward E-mail is my way of checking to see if you are all right and/or to let you know that we seem to be all right here.  I hope you are safe.

You may know that 130 Liberty Street was immediately across the street from World Trade Center 2, the so-called "south tower."  My understanding is that we are very fortunate to be able to report that our building and our offices in World Trade Center 4 were evacuated successfully.  However, that is not an official statement, and I have no additional information at this time.

Sadly, until further notice, the former 130 Liberty Street address cannot be used for any reason.  If you need to deliver correspondence or documentation of any kind that cannot be held pending discussion and/or further instruction, please deliver it in care of:

     BRIAN J. McGUIRE
     DEUTSCHE BANK A.G. NEW YORK
     31 WEST 52ND STREET NYC01-1312
     NEW YORK NY 10019-6160

     Facsimile:     212-469-5630
     Telephone:     212-469-5589

Although I have no telephone at this time, it might be possible to reach me via David C. Rodriguez at 212-469-7116 or Doris Eagan at 212-469-5892.  Please keep in mind that we have access to no paper records at this time.

Additionally, because so many people have been affected by Tuesday's events and have had so many questions, I have taken the liberty of attaching a Microsoft Word document that contains a summer 2000 photograph of the area that shows the proximity of 130 Liberty Street to the World Trade Center.

In the attached Microsoft _Word_ document (586KB) (602,112 bytes used) is an
annotated satellite photograph of lower Manhattan and the once World Trade
Center from last year that identifies the location of my now-former office
building.  Annotations have been corrected pursuant to a press conference of
the mayor of New York City, ended today at 10:40.

The document has been scanned with antivirus software prior to sending.
Although it was determined to be free of software virus, it should be
scanned again prior to launching or opening on your computer or network.
