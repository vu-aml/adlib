FIRING CONTRACTOR, HIRING NONUNION CREW WAS ULP, SPLIT BOARD
DECIDES

A company that owns and manages a building in New York City
committed unfair labor practices when it abruptly ended its
relationship with a contractor that supplied the building's
cleaning crew and then refused to rehire those workers
because of their union affiliation, the National Labor
Relations Board rules in a 2-1 decision ("E.S. Sutton Realty
Co.,  "3367 N.L.R.B. No. 33,   9/28/01 [released 10/17/01].
).

Reversing an NLRB administrative law judge, Chairman Hurtgen
and Member Liebman rule that E.S. Sutton Realty Co.
unlawfully refused to hire five workers after it ended its
contract with Crisfield, their former employer. In addition,
Sutton was a successor employer obliged to recognize and
bargain with the workers' union, Local 32B-32J of the
Service Employees International Union, the board rules. The
majority criticizes the NLRB administrative law judge for
resolving in favor of Sutton various inconsistencies in
testimony by Sutton employees. But Member Walsh dissents,
rebuking the majority for second-guessing the ALJ's
credibility assessments. . . . Page AA-1

NINTH CIRCUIT: SUPERINTENDENTS NOT LIABLE FOR UNIONS'
INADEQUATE NOTICE

Public school superintendents in California who deducted
agency fees from the paychecks of nonmember teachers are not
liable for unions' failure to provide an adequate
explanation of the basis for the fee calculation, the Ninth
Circuit rules ("Foster v. Mahdesian, "9th Cir., No.
00-15028, 10/15/01). Reversing summary judgment granted to
four nonmember teachers, the appeals court holds "[a]ction
more serious than the routine collection of fees is
required" to trigger a public employer's duty to ensure that
its employees receive adequate financial disclosure. The
appeals court applies its 1997 decision in "Knight v. Kenai
Peninsula Borough School District", which held that a public
employer's duty to ensure proper notice arises when a union
takes action against a nonmember for failure to pay agency
fees.

The four teachers unions, locals of the California Teachers
Association, did not appeal a district court ruling that the
unions' financial disclosure was not adequate under the U.S.
Supreme Court's 1996 decision in "Chicago Teachers Union
Local 1 v. Hudson". . . . Page A-1

ANTI-NEPOTISM POLICY BARRING HUSBAND, WIFE UPHELD BY SIXTH
CIRCUIT

A newly wed Tennessee woman, who was forced to leave her job
because of a public utility company's policy barring the
employment of married couples, loses her challenge to the
constitutionality of that policy before the Sixth Circuit
("Vaughn v. Lawrenceburg Power System, "6th Cir., No.
99-00012, 10/19/01).  However, the court holds that her
husband, who was also fired following an altercation about
the anti-nepotism policy, can proceed with a claim of
retaliatory discharge under the First Amendment.

 "The rule of exogamy in Lawrenceburg Power System's
anti-nepotism policy does not violate the fundamental right
of marriage" and "advances a legitimate governmental
interest," Judge Boggs writes for the appeals court, in
rejecting Jennifer and Keith Vaughn's argument that the
policy violated their First Amendment rights of association.
But he finds that Keith Vaughn's discharge--arguably because
he was speaking out against the policy--could be the basis
of a constitutional claim. . . . Page A-5,  Text E-1

JUDGE REFUSES TO AWARD INSURANCE BENEFITS  TO WIDOW OF
IMPROPER ENROLLEE

The widow of a deceased employee of Oce-USA Inc.  cannot
recover benefits under the group life insurance plan, the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois
rules, finding the employee was not eligible for coverage
when he enrolled ("Ostler v. Oce-USA Inc., "N.D. Ill.,  No.
00 C 7753, 10/4/01).

Judge Kocoras finds that recovery of life insurance benefits
that would have been paid if Tim Ostler had been eligible
for coverage under the plan would not be "appropriate
equitable relief" under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act. The court rejects the Second Circuit's
reasoning in a similar decision in "Strom v. Goldman Sachs &
Co." Judge Kocoras says he disagrees with the Second
Circuit's conclusion that Title VII "remedies can be
imported into an ERISA context, because the rationales
underlying the two statutes are simply too different."

While Ostler was on short-term disability leave, Oce-USA
offered a new group life insurance plan. Ostler elected to
participate in the plan, and Oce-USA began deducting plan
premiums from his paycheck. After Ostler's death his widow's
benefit claim was denied because Ostler was not a qualified
participant in that he did not fulfill the requirement that
he be an employee "active at work" at the time coverage
began. . . . Page A-3

COURT AFFIRMS VERDICT FOR WORKER WITH BAD BACK; DENIES
PUNITIVE DAMAGES

An assembly line worker for a trucking parts firm who was
fired after three work-related back surgeries provided
sufficient evidence of disability discrimination under the
Americans with Disabilities Act and unlawful retaliation for
filing a workers' compensation claim to support a jury
verdict in his favor, the Eighth Circuit decides ("Webner v.
Titan Distrib. Inc.", 8th Cir., No. 00-2941, 10/9/01).
Affirming, for the most part, a judgment for plaintiff
Randall Webner, the appeals court rejects the argument by
Titan Distribution Inc. that Webner does not have a
disability covered by the ADA. "Viewing all the evidence ...
we conclude that a reasonable jury could have determined
that Webner's back injury had substantially limited his
ability to work, to twist, to bend, and to stand, in
addition to limiting his ability to lift," Judge Hansen
writes for the appeals court.

The court, however, vacates a punitive damages award.
Observing that a plaintiff seeking such damages under the
ADA must show that the defendant acted with "malice or
reckless indifference to the plaintiff's federally protected
rights," the court says Webner failed to prove Titan knew it
was violating the ADA or was indifferent to breaching that
law. . . . Page A-4
