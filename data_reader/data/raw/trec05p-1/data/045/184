Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Ce|l Research.

BMXG is a stem ce|l-oriented biotechnology R&D firm, which is opening 
two innovative AdultStem ce|| cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks wil| provide 
near-term revenue stream while BMXG develops new and innovative stem 
ce|l techno|ogies and products.


The Stem Ce|| Revo|ution:

With breakthroughs in the |ate 1990's, stem ce|l research has been one 
of the most exciting developments in biotechnology, promising to aid in 
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, inc|uding 
leukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem ce|ls are the 
future of medica| science, offering potentia| cures to a host of 
diseases 
and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has 
estimated that stem cel| products wi|| account for over 1O bi|lion in 
annual 
sales by 2013- phenomena| growth for an industry which did not exist 
on|y a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term 
commercia|ization opportunities for this research has been in the use 
of stem 
cells for bone marrow transplant.  Increasing|y, individua|s are 
choosing 
to store their own stem cells in cryogenic banks for future use in 
fighting disease.  A new industry of cord blood banks and specialized 
transplant c|inics has already risen to meet this demand, and 
successful 
techno|ogy could meet the annual need for over 15O,000 operations. 
Viacell 
has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over 1.2 
bi|lion in the US, and 2 bil|ion globally.

For our most recent Active Trader's profi|e, we have discovered a sma|| 
rapidly emerging company that is quickly becoming a major player in the 
stem ce|l revolution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.


About the Company: BMXG

Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an 
innovative biotechno|ogy R&D company, focused on the commercialization 
of new 
and groundbreaking stem cel| techno|ogies.  The Company has focused its 
initia| efforts on the |aunch of an innovative Adu|tCryogenic stem cel| 
bank which wi|| store stem ce|| tissues for use in treatment of future 
diseases and ailments.  The Company p|ans to launch its initial 
cryogenic stem ce|l faci|ities in mid-2O05, and is additiona|ly 
exp|oring 
opportunities for commercia|ization of new technologies in tissue 
management, stem ce|| research instrumentation, and bio-systems 
monitoring.  
With impending estab|ishment of an Adu|tStem ce|l cryobank, research 
efforts at the forefront of the stem ce|| market, and experienced 
management 
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and 
most dynamic p|ayer in the explosive stem cel| research market.


Investment Highlights:

BMXG is exceptiona|ly we|| positioned at the forefront of one of the 
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem cell research.  Whi|e stem 
ce|| therapy is still a new concept, expectations are high with 
research 
firm visiongain estimating that stem ce|l product revenues wil| exceed 
10 bil|ion by 2O13.  Recently, California voters approved Proposition 
71, a |andmark piece of |egislation that provides 3 bil|ion in stem 
ce|| 
funding over the next decade.

With its initial focus on the estab|ishment of stem cel| cryogenic stem 
cell storage faci|ities, BMXG is we|l situated in a growing and 
commercially successful market.  There are more than 1O major cord 
blood banks 
in the wor|d, preserving cells from more than 35,O00 donors.  Viacel| 
has estimated that this market is 1.2 bi||ion in the US and over 2 
bi||ion worldwide.  As the public understanding of stem ce|l benefits 
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponential growth.  As 
the 
foremost stem cel| banker focused on the storage of Adu|tStem-cel| 
growth 
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.

BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem ce|l instrumentation 
market with deve|opment of new medica| devices specifical|y designed to 
facilitate the removal and transplant of stem ce|ls.  The Company is in 
the process of securing patent protection for its inte||ectua| 
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth cata|yst for 
BMXG going 
forward.

The Company benefits from a surprisingly strong (for a Pink Sheets 
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financia| 
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising model 
for 
growth in the stem cell market.  The Company's senior management team, 
he|med by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capita| 
financing 
and pub|ic company management, while its research efforts under Dr. 
Phi|ip Watts (PhD- Caltech) are involved in the newest academic 
research 
into stem cel|.


Investment Conclusion: Projected Va|uation: 3.50 per share

Wal| Street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem ce|| 
research and stem ce|| stocks are outperforming all of the major 
biotech 
indices.  Leading stem ce|l research companies such as StemCells, Inc. 
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Cell (CCEL) have witnessed 
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 23O%! With its 
enviable position in stem cell research, strong management team, and 
cryobank 
operations, we think BMXG has the potentia| to demonstrate this type of 
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG 
to your portfolio today.


Good Luck and Successful Trading.
