I am not sure I understand the question.  Do you mean at anytime we call on SBA volumes, we never/should not allocate the location?

	I guess the question is - have we ever actually reviewed when we call on the SBA volumes and what the system conditions have been during those periods.  We want to verify that we are not allocating a point when we have SBA gas flowing.  Theatrically, we argue that we would not call on SBAs if the gas was not needed to meet system requirements.  We' want to verify that the theory and the actual match up.  I hope this makes sense.  Thanks MW

Yes, you are correct. The changes in the business requirements for the scheduling priority of SBA contracts will not impact NNG's primary firm shippers. What do you need to verify and support this fact?

	These are the SBA contracts that were provided during the due diligence.  I'd like to be able to verify and support that the changes in the business requirements for the scheduling priority for these SBA contracts do not result in an impact to NNG's primary firm shippers.  Your assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks MW
