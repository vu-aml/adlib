Latest NFL Player News

Thomas Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=187390&>, RB ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/02/01
Jones will continue his backup role this weekend against Philadelphia now that Michael Pittman has been cleared to play. He won't get enough playing time to warrant serious Fantasy consideration, so avoid using him. 

Michael Pittman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 11/02/01
Pittman has been cleared to play this weekend against Philadelphia. "Pitt practiced (Friday), he's fine, he's going to play," Head Coach Dave McGinnis repor! te! d. With Pittman playing, it looks as though Thomas Jones will play a lesser role than what was earlier reported. 

Richard Huntley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1456&>, RB CAR - Russell Updated 11/02/01
Huntley is expected to start this week against Miami, but he's not worth considering as a starter for your Fantasy team. Huntley will struggle against Miami's tough defense, and the possibility for bad weather in South Florida makes him an even bigger gamble. 

Chris Weinke <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/02/01
Weinke has thrown five interceptions in his last two games, and has almost dropped completely off the Fantasy Football map. He's no better than a reserve at this point, so don't bother starting him against Miami. 

Willie Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1234&>, WR NO - Martin Updated 11/02/01
Jackson won't post excellent yardage numbers this week, but still may find the end zone. The Saints will depend on the run against the Jets, yet they may look to Jackson on play-action fakes and in the red zone.

Wesley Walls <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01
Walls is a must-! st! art this weekend against Miami. He leads all NFC tight ends in receptions and is one of the more reliable Fantasy players in the league at his position. 

Ricky Williams <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=133448&>, RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/02/01
Williams should have an excellent outing this week. Expect him to rip major holes in the Jets' weak run defense throughout the game.

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/02/01
Muhammad has struggled in recent weeks, and facing a tough Miami secondary won't help his cause. He may be a top-notch Fantasy wideout, but it may be a wise move to reserve him this week if at all possible. 

Dez White <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01
White remains a risky start each week. While his overall numbers have improved, he is still dropping passes, and may eventually lose the No. 2 receiver job to David Terrell.

Maurice Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 11/02/01
Smith has been adequate at best since taking over for the in! ju! red Jamal Anderson in Atlanta. New England has been suspect against the run this season, so don't be surprised to see Smith score a rushing touchdown and compile 80-plus yards on the ground this week. 

Marty Booker <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=133228&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01
Booker may not post great yardage numbers against the Browns, but the Bears should be able to spread the field and give him the opportunity to catch at least one TD pass.

Chris Chandler <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01
Chandler has been an adequate starting quarterback for Fantasy owners this season, connecting on nine touchdown passes in five games. Unless you have a signal-caller with a better matchup, starting Chandler is a good move. 

Terance Mathis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Frank Updated 11/02/01
Mathis has been very unreliable this season, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a real gamble. He'll be facing Patriots' CB Ty Law this weekend, so try to avoid using him if possible. 

Johnnie Morton <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1223&>, WR DET - Hunter Updated 11/02/01
Morton should post good number! s ! against the 49ers this week. San Francisco's pass defense has been inconsistent, and the Lions may play from behind and pass the ball often.

Kevan Barlow <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 11/02/01
Barlow hasn't done much over the last few weeks, but he may find some success this weekend against the Lions' terrible run defense. If you're desperate for a tailback this week, Barlow may be a solid option. 

Garrison Hearst <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1164&>, RB SF - Frank Updated 11/02/01
Hearst could be in for a big game against Detroit this weekend. The Lions are allowing an average of 147.2 yards rushing per game, so be sure to start Hearst this weekend based on the matchup. 

Terrell Owens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 11/02/01
Owens could have a huge game on Sunday lining up against the Lions' depleted secondary. Owens is one of the league's top wideouts and worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Bubba Franks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01
Franks did not catch a TD pass in his first meeting with Tampa Bay this year. H! e ! has been a regular TD threat for the rest of the season, so don't bench him in any week.

J.J. Stokes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1292&>, WR SF - Matty Updated 11/02/01
Stokes has been horrible this season, so starting him in any week is a serious risk. At this point, Stokes isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues. 

Antonio Freeman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1226&>, WR GB - Hunter Updated 11/02/01
Freeman caught only one pass for six yards in his first meeting with Tampa Bay this year. He may disappoint again this week, because No. 2 WR Bill Schroeder is not expected to play.! 

Ahman Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 11/02/01
Green totaled 124 total yards from scrimmage in his first meeting with the Buccaneers this year. Expect him to be a key receiver again for Brett Favre this week, especially with No. 2 WR Bill Schroeder ailing. Favre may need Green to bail him out if Antonio Freeman is double-covered downfield.

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 11/02/01
Favre threw only one TD pass and was intercepted three times in his first meeting with Tampa Bay this year. Expect slightly better numbers from him at home against the Buccaneer! s ! this week. Favre may throw more than one TD pass, but expect at least one interception as well.

Jackie Harris <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01
Harris has done nothing this season, and isn't even worth a roster spot at this point. Unless you play in a very deep league, the Dallas tight end should be left on the waiver wire. 

Raghib Ismail <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01
Ismail has been an unproductive Fantasy player for most of the season, so starting him in any week in not advisable. In fact, "the Rocket" is only worth a roster spot in deeper leagues at this point. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01
Westbrook finally had a productive game last weekend against the Giants, catching two passes for 83 yards and a score. His luck won't be as good this week against Seattle CB Shawn Springs, so avoid starting outside of deeper leagues. 

Rod Gardner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01
Gardner has emerged as Washington's No. 1 receiving option, and is worth starting this weekend against Seattle. The Seahawks' secondary has been average this season, and facing CB Willie Williams shouldn't present much of a challenge to the talented rookie. 

Ron Dayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/02/01
Dayne has been very inconsistent this season, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. Dallas has been surprisingly tough against the run, which makes Dayne worth starting in deeper leagues only. 

Tiki Barber <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/02/01
Barber has had some success in the past against Dallas, so don't be surprised if he scores a TD this week. He won't put up huge yardage numbers, however, so start him based on the type of league you're involved in. 

Kerry Collins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1013&>, QB NYG - Russell Updated 11/02/01
Collins finally had a big game last weekend against Washington, but he's still been very inconsistent overall. He's had moderate success against Dallas in the past, and is only worth starting in deeper Fantasy leagues. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Russell Updated 11/02/01
Hilliard will start opposite Amani Toomer on Sunday against Dallas, and is worth starting on Fantasy teams in deeper leagues. Hilliard has played well of late, and is proving to be a decent Fantasy player once again.
