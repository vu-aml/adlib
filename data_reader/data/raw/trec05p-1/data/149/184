Tomorrow, generalists will receive a binder outlining the process of how the WARN notifications will occur.  I assume we need to mark these documents as confidential and proprietary.  Is there any specific wording you would like on either a introduction page or as a footer on each page?  Please let me know so I can include.

Thanks - Tana
