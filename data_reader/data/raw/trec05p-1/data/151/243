Alright,  I'll take the bet.  I'll have to scrounge around to find 40 buck though!  You know you're stealing money from my severance!  I may need that to eat on by the end of the week.  If you say the line is 9, that works for me.  CU is on a role....it's time for Simms to go down!

If you steal my money, you'll have to buy me a beer.

Since you never gave me the $20 for the last time we bet on CU/Texas, I figured I would give you the chance to go double or nothing on the second round.  I think the line is Texas -9.  Let me know.
