We are going to do a month to month interupptible purchase agreement with Patina Oil and Gas.  The gas will be delivered into Lost Creek.  The price will be Gas Daily Cig Midpoint index flat.  The flows will vary daily depending upon well production.  I am not sure if we have an interruptible purchase agreement with Kennedyl

Did Paul ask you to put together a wellhead purchase for Huber in the Powder River Basin?
