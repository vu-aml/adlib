Hi Andrea,

Sorry it took so long to get this to you.  Things are a little hectic as we pick up other peoples tasks.  I have been doing east desk fundamentals for about 6 months now, so if you have anymore data or analysis questions please ask, and I might be able to help out.

If you need anything more for the presentation such as other pipe flows, pricing data, etc. just call
