You are all confirmed...the place is not.

Unfortunately Laurel's is too close to the real thing...it sucks!  So I
canceled

I made a res at Cafe Monk on 4th between Brennan and Brannon.  Other
suggestions were Thirsty Bear and Cha-Cha-Cha, both good, but greasy food.

Any oppositions to Cafe Monk, or better suggestions?  (I tried Boogaloos but
they are closed Thursday)
