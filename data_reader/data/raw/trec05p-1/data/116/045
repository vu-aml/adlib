Hello all.  I am back from the CPUC and available to participate again.  As
for Sue's concern, I do not believe Edison will say that our payment of PX
credit issue (the subject of the complaints) is directly in the
"free-for-all" case, but they will assert that that case will resolve the
issues related to how to calculate the credit in the post  Jan 17 time frame
and that once that is decided, Edison will have all the information it needs
to pay all the ESPs correctly, as they still intend to pay us on the
original methodology for the pre Jan 17 period.  Therefore, they will say
that once the Commission resolves the free for all issues it will resolve
all the issues in the complaint.  I should respond to SCE's attorney soon,
so we can contact the judge and ask him to take the matter off calendar.  Is
everyone in accord?  Mike Day

I'm concerned about the 2nd bullet.  We've been taking the position that
we don't want this "payment of PX credit" issue in this proceeding --
the "free-for-all" proceeding. Have we changed our position?  If not, I
am concerned that Edison will either state directly or give the
impression that it's part of the Barnett proceeding.
