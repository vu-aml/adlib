This afternoon (Wednesday 12/19) we delivered all 468 gift bags to Gordon Elementary for their student Holiday Party on 12/20.  With your help, we raised over $2000 that we used to sponsor 33 of those children.  

Due to recent company events, the Enron Kids Committee had a very difficult time getting sponsors for all the kids, but no one was left out.  We used our remaining charity fund to make sure EVERY child received their gift.  

Though we reduced the sponsor amount by eliminating the shoes and jacket from the gift bags, we had enough money left over to purchase gift certificates for shoes for the kids from a national chain store.  

Though a lot of program sponsors we're without jobs this holiday season, we only had to buy gifts for 23 kids (5% of the total) at the last minute; this was significantly less than what I had dreaded it might be.

Thank you for all your help and support.  468 Houston children have a better holiday because of you.

Best Wishes to You All,
Kevin Hyatt
Co-Chairman
Enron Kids Committee 2001
