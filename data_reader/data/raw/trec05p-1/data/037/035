Hi, I'm back.

Please fax the IRS notice to me at the number below if you haven't
already
and I'll review it for you.

Regarding the counselling session, I am available tomorrow all day,
Wednesday afternoon after 1:30pm, Thursday afternoon after 2pm and
Friday
after 2pm.  Next week I'll be out of the office Tuesday and Wednesday as
well as Thursday afternoon.  The next week I am out of the office on a
course all week (Sept 8-14).

Will any of these time slots work for you?

Send me a note when you get back and we can set up a meeting then.

Also, I received a notice from the IRS and it appears that they were
missing information on my wife and as such disallowed me claiming her as
a dependent.  I will send to your attention to review and clarify. Based
on my filing and actual refund there is about a $ 1k difference which I
believe is owed to me.

Good morning Barry,

Just to let you know that I am on holidays August 11-26, so your
counselling will have to be this week or when I return.

Did Enron provide you with approval for a "Post Arrival
Consultation"/PAC?
This is the counselling our PwC Houston office does.  (So, in effect
there
are two possible counselling sessions for assignees - the predeparture
counselling you are supposed to receive before you depart Canada and
then
there's the PAC).  PwC Houston is prepared to set up the "PAC" - they
simply want to know if you received approval for it.

Thanks,
