Dear Barny

PRIVACY POLICY NOTICE TO INDIVIDUAL CLIENTS ABOUT CONSUMER FINANCIAL
INFORMATION

Our Privacy Policy has been sent to you in accordance with the rules of
the Federal Trade Commission as provided by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP respects your right to keep your personal
information confidential and to avoid unwanted solicitations. We trust
that our Privacy Policy will provide you with a better understanding of
our commitment to keep your personal information confidential and secure
while serving you.

INFORMATION WE HAVE ABOUT YOU
We receive information about you that is not available publicly. This
information is received from a variety of sources, including:

* Information you provide directly to us, such as: your name, address,
social security number, assets, liabilities and income.

* Information we receive with your authorization from third parties, such
as: financial institutions, companies, and other individuals.

* Information from consumer reporting agencies.

PROTECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION
We use the information acquired solely for the purpose of providing tax
consulting, compliance and other professional advisory services to you. We
take reasonable steps to keep confidential the information acquired. Our
right to disclose the information is limited by our Code of Conduct,
applicable law, the Code of Professional Conduct of the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and accounting authorities of
foreign countries. Where appropriate, information provided by us to
employees, affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties who perform services
for us, is subject to contractual agreements which prohibit these parties
from disclosing or using the information other than for the purposes for
which the information was disclosed. We also maintain reasonable physical,
electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable laws
and regulations to protect your nonpublic personal information.

GENERAL RESTRICTIONS ON DISCLOSURE OF NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION TO
AFFILIATES AND NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES
As tax preparers, we are prohibited by Internal Revenue Code Section 7216
from disclosing your income tax return information without your consent,
other than for the specific purpose of preparing, assisting in preparing
or obtaining and providing services in connection with the preparation of
an income tax return for you. Furthermore, as members of the AICPA engaged
in income tax preparation or financial planning, we are generally
prohibited from disclosing confidential client information about you to
affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties without your specific consent.

PARTIES TO WHOM WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION
We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our clients or
former clients to our affiliates or to nonaffiliated third parties except
as permitted by law and the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct. Nonpublic
personal information about current and former clients may be disclosed to
both our affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties as permitted by law
and the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct, as follows:

1. Complying with a validly issued and enforceable summons or subpoena.

2. In the course of a review of our firm's practices under the peer review
rules of the AICPA or a similar professional board.

3. Initiating a complaint or responding to an inquiry made by the
professional ethics division or trial board of the AICPA or duly
constituted investigative or disciplinary body of another State CPA
Society or Board of Accountancy.

4. A review of a professional practice of our firm in conjunction with a
prospective purchase, sale, or merger of all or part of our practice,
provided that we take appropriate precautions (for example, through a
written confidentiality agreement) so the prospective purchaser does not
disclose information obtained in the course of the review.

5. Participating in actual or threatened legal proceedings or alternative
dispute resolution proceedings either initiated by or against us, provided
we disclose only the information necessary to file, pursue, or defend
against the lawsuit, and take reasonable precautions to ensure that the
information disclosed does not become a matter of public record.

6. Providing information to affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties who
perform services or functions for us pursuant to a contractual agreement
which prohibits the third party or affiliate from disclosing or using the
information other than for the purposes for which the information was
disclosed.

PRIVACY POLICY UPDATES
We will provide notice of our Privacy Policy annually, as long as you
maintain an ongoing relationship with us. The policy may change from time
to time.Wood, Judy
