Mark:
 
Unfortunately, I don't have many LOIs or term sheets in my database any longer -- I'm trying to locate some good go-bys from other attorneys and some hard copies from my form files and will send them up to you.  In the meantime, here is an LOI and Term Sheet that I used for a John Thompson deal last year, but I will forward a more appropriate LOI and Term Sheet to you shortly.
