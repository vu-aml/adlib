	Are there any plans for either Enron or Dynegy (or both) to initiate information dissemination to Capitol Hill, as is usually
	done in these situations?  This is what I have experienced when on the Hill and when representing companies either
	being acquired or doing the merger/acquisition.  Our friends on the Hill will wonder where we and they have been,
	particularly if, as is likely, we may need them later on.  Better to get in with them on the ground floor.  I know there is a
	lot going on, but it would be beneficial to the merger approval process to at least have informal contacts starting this week
	before they leave for Thanksgiving.

	Thanks for the conference calls to keep us up to date and for being candid in doing so.

	John

Subject:	Dynegy/Enron Point of Contact
Importance:	High

As the merger between Dynegy & Enron goes through, any calls received requesting documentation or information regarding the merger should be relayed to me. I will be the point of contact for all Dynegy/Enron information requests.
