The website above has the link to the list of ERCs that are part of the approved attainment plan.

If it is pre-1990, and could be used under the new rule, it will be on this list.

If it is not on this list, we would need to contact the Northern regional office to inquire into its history.  If it is post 1990 it would be part of the baseline and would also work -- so we need to know the date.

In the case of the certificate you mention, it is not on the list, so we would need to contact the regional office to find out its status.

The main number for the office is 209 557-6400.  Jim Swaney is the manager -- but an engineer might be able to look it up quickly.  Or we could fax the request to 209-557-6475.  While EPA says that this type of request is fairly rare, it is not unusual.

Please let me know if you need further help on this.
