isn't it hide nor "hare"?  I really don't know, and can't make sense out of
it all. I've been paying attention to phrases lately that just don't make
sense.  Like chocolate thunderbolt, baby.  It's a stretch to make it work,
but oh so fitting for the setting. 

Do you know what I want?

Man, now I'm upset.  My "buddy" up here said he'd get a group of his "team"
together for that night as well.  After a few margaritas, it won't really
matter what happens. C'mon, man. What?

I'll bring my pickle packets.

Make it happen, Chetuck. BTW...whatever happened to your reply about our
impending "foursome"??? Very "excited"  about the opportunity...

OK...this is the final and definitive MAN NIGHT agenda...it WILL NOT CHANGE,
heretofore.

Where?- Tampico Mexican Seafood.  610 to Airline...Right on Airline, Go
about 4 blocks, you will pass the Farmers Market and just past that will be
Tampico. Queried Zander again about it this morning and he said they DO have
security and the clientele is an eclectic mix of Mexican day laborers
drinking Mexican beer and those little packets of salt and lime, dining next
to large tables of rich blue-blood yuppie types...Good Fun. Kind of like a
good noodle house or other oriental type place...if you see the natives
eating there, you know it's good. Besides after listening to Joe and Chet, I
would agree that Tony's is ABSOLUTELY OUT OF THE QUESTION.

When?- Thursday 2/28- 7:15 pm.

Who?- Head count is as follows...Piggy, Lease Nazi, Captain Safety,
Monkey-Noise Boy, Big Boy Chambers (?), Fenner-Weiner(?)

MEN...please RSVP such that we can appropriately "sign" to the non-English
speaking staff how many Ritas we need to order upon arrival.

See you MEN at the MAN function, to do MAN-typical things.

								PIGGY

Eat me, Wollam.  Did you notice the "Out of Office" message from my email,
home slice?

Not sure what the 20 "MAN NIGHT" emails are in my inbox from yesterday, but
noted the Thurs. night dinner.  I have conflict which I will try to unwind
for my attendance.  However, not sure that we want to be at Tony's on such
night, based on what my co-worker says!
