Geoff - 

Attached for your approval are four confirmations for the Ring Trades done among Enron,
Reliant, and Bank of Montreal:

    

You will note that an Exhibit A is attached to each confirm - but  can you tell me from
whom at both counterparties I can obtain the Exhibit B (transaction b/t Reliant and BOM)
in order to attach that as well.  

Please review and advise.

Thanks,
Diane
