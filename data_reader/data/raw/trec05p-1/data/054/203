Who is your mexican expert?  Our El Paso Natural Gas south mainline expansions to Mexico are going to serve mainly CFE generation.  Do they  or will they have the transmission to bring that into the states?  If not, which market will it serve, etc?    Let me know if your marketing group has any info.

Thanks,
Mike
