  By late November folks aren't thinking about legal research, they're thinking about food. Our answer:

--discount subscriptions to TheLaw.net for the month of November by up to 20%
--send you something sharp and something sweet

  Subscribe to TheLaw.net before the end of November and we'll immediately direct the farm families of the Cabot Creamery in Cabot, Vermont, to ship you a pint of their pure Vermont Maple Syrup and a pound of their Vintage Vermont Cheddar. See, http://www.cabotcheese.com
see also http://www.thelaw.net/cabotoffer.htm


…AND SAVE 20% ON THELAW.NET CONVENIENCE EDITION!

  Just $395 (save $100!) on TheLaw.net Convenience Edition. TheLaw.net is a custom legal browser. It is very easy to use. $395 covers you for a year. You have unlimited access to everything. Install at work at home and on your laptop and feel-free to hand the software off to your trusted assistant at no extra charge. And did we mention there's a 30-day unconditional money back guarantee.

  Our Small Office Special is on sale, too, and the prices for multi-user Workgroups look even more attractive. See, http://www.thelaw.net/subscribe.htm

  Of course, our large competitors' databases have been a work in progress for generations. But, times have changed. A judicial opinion does not take on greater precedential value merely because it's fed to you via a WestLaw pipeline. It just costs more to read it. If you take a look at the searchable case law database you'll have UNLIMITED access to with TheLaw.net we stack up quite nicely, particularly when you consider the price.
See, http://www.thelaw.net/caselawgrid.htm
 
  By deploying TheLaw.net in your world you may discover that:

----your online productivity increases ten fold
----the list of expensive subscription items is much shorter
----it makes sense to turn to the big guns only when you cannot otherwise find the answer elsewhere, faster, cheaper.

  
…UNRESOLVED MANAGEMENT ISSUES

  Are you one of the select few who wants for little or nothing, or are you in a pick-and-choose mode with the overwhelming majority of your colleagues when it comes to choosing legal research resources?

     --What do you do when you have to research across state lines?

     --What do you do with a Federal question that properly demands a national look across all thirteen Federal circuits?

     --Our subscribers snicker to themselves, click a checkbox to search all states or all Federal and they pay not one thin additional dime for the privilege. (See covered jurisdictions listed below the signature line.)


"I AM IN MY SWEATS DOING BILLABLE RESEARCH. I LOVE IT!"

     And there you have our new favorite quote, from a new subscriber leaving a large firm to start her own thing. We have others; lots of them. See, http://www.thelaw.net/references.htm

     What's not to like?

--TheLaw.net is less than $1 a day for an individual annual subscription to our Solo Edition. Even less per day, per workgroup user. See, http://www.thelaw.net/susbcribe.htm

--Enter a statutory cite into the search engine, and pop up cases construing that item, in one mouse click. See, http://www.thelaw.net/statutes.htm

--Have a case citation you need to know more about? Find cases construing that item in one mouse click. Simple.

--Easy to use? Do you know how to operate a browser, shuttle through little windows folders and do electronic case law research? If so, you're on your way to being a guru using TheLaw.net. If you don't know how to perform these tasks, we will teach at no cost.

--PERFORM UNKNOWN ITEM SEARCHES: Use Boolean and, or, not, near, within, adjacent, nesting, truncation See, Sample Searches: http://www.thelaw.net/searchdemo/home.htm
     
--PERFORM KNOWN ITEM SEARCHES: Field search by cite, party, counsel, docket, author, date or panel.  See, http://www.thelaw.net/help/operators.htm
