A Daring New Position

Husband: Shall we try a new position tonight?

Wife: Sure. You stand by the ironing board and I'll sit on the couch and
drink
beer and fart!

I hope you enjoyed the above joke.  Come meet me at Marlowe's this Friday,
October 26th for a Complimentary Cosmopolitan!  Smirnoff Raspberry will be

Friday!
