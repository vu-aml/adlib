        Dear Reader,

        Maybe it’s the penicillin business model wherein a
        company on a market pathway elsewhere discovers
        unexpected profit opportunities along the roadside.  It
        now seems that beverage maker Sweet Success
        Enterprises, Inc. (OTCBB:SWTS) has found its own
        unexpected opportunity.  And like the aforementioned
        wonder drug, there might just be a scientific reason.

        Recent headlines from Sweet Success affirm the
        company’s pleasant surprise at its early sales results
        on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), reporting that Sweet
        Success products had quickly sold out at Amazon and
        that a key Sweet Success drink had been selected as a
        ‘Amazon Movers and Shakers” item based on sales.  Now,
        Sweet Success’s CEO believes that online outlets could
        become the driving force behind the product's
        expansion.

        And in reference to science, the fact that Sweet
        Success’s product line doesn’t require refrigeration,
        as many of its competitor's products do, gives the
        company an interesting competitive advantage in the
        online marketplace where items must be shipped.
        Products that need to be kept cool are going to be left
        out in the cold so to speak when it comes to online
        efforts.  (SEE NEWS BELOW)

           The No. 4 Ranking of Sweet Success' GlucaSafe Among
           Amazon.com's Movers and Shakers Spurs Expansion to
                       Other E-commerce Retailers

        SAN ANTONIO, May 14, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- Sweet
        Success Enterprises (OTC BB:SWTS.OB - News), the maker
        of a line of innovative and delicious healthy-lifestyle
        beverages, announced that the company's revolutionary
        GlucaSafe(r) -- a functional health beverage - was
        ranked no. 4 by Amazon.com Movers and Shakers. This
        ranking has spurred the Company to expand into other
        E-commerce retailers.

        On May 2, 2007, the Company announced that Sweet
        Success(r) products had quickly sold out at Amazon.com.
        Amazon.com was the company's prime choice to enter into
        the electronic markets or "e-tailers" to offer its new
        Fuel for Health(r) line of wellness beverages.

        On Monday, May 7th 2007, the company received a report
        from Amazon.com called Amazon.com Movers & Shakers.
        Amazon.com reported that the biggest gainers in
        Amazon.com's sale rank in the past 24 hours included
        Sweet Success GlucaSafe. GlucaSafe was ranked no. 4 in
        the grocery category following Lancome Hydra Zen
        Moisturizing Cream at no. 3, Neutrogena Triple Moisture
        at no. 2 and Similac Baby Formula at no. 1. "This type
        of initial sales velocity in the electronic market
        place is exciting for us," says William Gallagher,
        Sweet Success CEO. "Initially, we looked at Amazon.com
        as another retailer to join the ranks among grocers
        such as Texas-based H-E-B grocery stores, but now we
        believe e-commerce retailers could be some of the
        largest distributors for the company."

        With recent events at Amazon, the company now believes
        that the electronic retail market could be one of its
        largest sectors of distribution. This broad market
        could include accounts such as online drugstores and
        other retailers, such as the club stores, that have
        brick and mortar outlets as well as thriving online
        sales. "With the global reach of the online market we
        have the capability to span oceans and suddenly be
        retailing in Japan, which already has a huge market for
        health and nutritional products," continued Gallagher.

        E-commerce is not available to most of Sweet Success'
        competition, Odwalla and Naked Juice, because their
        products require refrigeration. All of Sweet Success
        products are shelf stable.

        Amazon.com, Inc., a Fortune 500 company based in
        Seattle, opened on the World Wide Web in July 1995 and
        today offers Earth's Biggest Selection. Amazon.com,
        Inc. seeks to be Earth's most customer-centric company,
        where customers can find and discover anything they
        might want to buy online, and endeavors to offer its
        customers the lowest possible prices. Amazon.com and
        other sellers offer millions of unique new, refurbished
        and used items in categories such as health and
        personal care, jewelry and watches, gourmet food,
        sports and outdoors, apparel and accessories, books,
        music, DVDs, electronics and office, toys and baby, and
        home and garden.

        Sweet Success Enterprises, Inc. ("Sweet Success")
        ("SWTS) engages in the production, distribution, and
        marketing of ready-to-drink functional health beverages
        in the U.S. under the trademarked Fuel For Health™
        brand name targeting 4 to 64 year olds.  The
        fast-growing natural and wellness beverage market is
        now approaching $25 billion.

        San Antonio-based Sweet Success Enterprises Inc.
        acquired Nestlé’s original Sweet Success™ brand and has
        re-launched as Fuel for Health™; an all natural product
        line to tap into the rapidly growing demand for all
        natural and self stable health and wellness beverages.
        Sweet Success is now available in a growing number of
        stores and includes select ingredients to satiate,
        boost energy and immunity and enhance a healthy
        lifestyle. Sweet Success® contracts for the production,
        marketing and distribution of all-natural beverages
        under the brand names Sweet Success® Fuel For Health™.

        The Sweet Success product line includes: GlucaSafe, a
        functional health beverage with green and white tea,
        pomegranate extract and Cinnulin PF® which may support
        healthy glucose metabolism in many individuals;
        Vita-Tein, a protein based beverage available in
        chocolate super shake and a vanilla super shake; Power

        As American's lifestyles have evolved away from soda
        pop, and alternative beverages like bottled water and
        tea, coffee, and energy drinks have taken over the
        beverage industry, SWTS is well-positioned in the new
        and expanding market of vitamin and mineral enriched
        products.

        Sweet Success now offers a full line of healthy and
        functional beverages that are all-natural, great
        tasting, and are produced with state-of-the-art
        ingredients focused on delivering endurance, heart
        health, and a natural energy boost.  Operating within
        an Exploding Industry, the supplemental beverages that
        SWTS produces have been formulated and reformulated,
        test-marketed, and repositioned in their market space
        for consumers. The work is done and now SWTS is rolling
        out product across the U.S.  Sweet Success’ Fuel for
        Health™ beverages are coming to market at the right
        time; when the demand is high.

          Sweet Success Wellness Beverages Available in Texas'
                             Largest Grocer

        SAN ANTONIO, April 25, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- Sweet
        Success Enterprises (OTC BB:SWTS.OB - News), maker of a
        line of innovative and delicious healthy-lifestyle
        beverages, announced today the long-awaited
        availability of its Fuel for Health(tm) product line in
        H-E-B Grocery Company stores. Sweet Success offers a
        complete line of shelf stable, all natural functional
        beverages, including GlucaSafe(tm), the only beverage
        containing Cinnilun PF(r), that may support healthy
        glucose levels, as a key ingredient.

        Based in San Antonio, H-E-B employs more than 60,000
        Partners (employees) and serves millions of customers
        in more than 300 stores and 150 communities throughout
        Texas and Mexico.

        The complete line of the seven Fuel for Health
        beverages will be merchandised in Sweet Success coolers
        in select H-E-B Healthy Living stores plus placement on
        the shelf in other Healthy Living stores throughout the
        state. ``A part of our sales and distributions goals is
        to enter accounts we have targeted since we began beta
        testing our products through regional markets in 2005,"
        said William Gallagher, Sweet Success' Chairman and
        CEO. "We are thrilled that we have attained cooler
        space in H-E-B's Healthy Living stores."

        The coolers, which display all seven healthy beverages
        through a glass door, will be prominently placed in the
        high-end stores. While Sweet Success beverages are
        shelf stable, cooler placement will facilitate
        immediate consumption due to impulse buying. Each
        cooler will contain consumer information on functional
        ingredients, benefits and nutritional facts. Shortly
        after cooler placement, Sweet Success will conduct
        in-store demos to allow consumers to sample the all
        natural functional beverage line.

        Sweet Success healthy-lifestyle beverages will be
        delivered to the H-E-B stores by Kehe Food
        Distributors. The Company recently announced an
        agreement whereby the national distributor will carry
        all seven Fuel for Health products.

        San Antonio-based Sweet Success Enterprises, Inc.
        acquired Nestle's original Sweet Success(tm) brand in
        2002 and has re-launched a product line to tap into the
        rapidly growing demand for convenient and nutritious
        functional beverages. Its line of Fuel for Health(tm)
        all-natural beverages is available in a growing number
        of stores and includes select ingredients to satiate,
        boost energy and immunity and enhance a healthy
        lifestyle.

<p>Dear Reader,<font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">Maybe it’s the penicillin business model wherein
a company on a market pathway elsewhere discovers unexpected profit opportunities

And like the aforementioned wonder drug, there might just be a scientific
reason.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">Recent headlines from <b>Sweet Success </b>affirm
the company’s pleasant surprise at its early sales results on <b>Amazon.com

out at Amazon and that a key Sweet Success drink had been selected as a
‘Amazon Movers and Shakers” item based on sales.&nbsp; Now, Sweet Success’s
CEO believes that online outlets could become the driving force behind
the product's expansion.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">And in reference to science, the fact that Sweet
Success’s product line doesn’t require refrigeration, as many of its competitor's
products do, gives the company an interesting competitive advantage in

the maker of a line of innovative and delicious healthy-lifestyle beverages,

<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>On
May 2, 2007, the Company announced that Sweet Success(r) products had quickly
sold out at Amazon.com. Amazon.com was the company's prime choice to enter

line of wellness beverages.</font></font></font><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1></font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>On
Monday, May 7th 2007, the company received a report from Amazon.com called
Amazon.com Movers &amp; Shakers. Amazon.com reported that the biggest gainers
in Amazon.com's sale rank in the past 24 hours included Sweet Success GlucaSafe.
GlucaSafe was ranked no. 4 in the grocery category following Lancome Hydra
Zen Moisturizing Cream at no. 3, Neutrogena Triple Moisture at no. 2 and
Similac Baby Formula at no. 1. "This type of initial sales velocity in
the electronic market place is exciting for us," says William Gallagher,
Sweet Success CEO. "Initially, we looked at Amazon.com as another retailer
to join the ranks among grocers such as Texas-based H-E-B grocery stores,
but now we believe e-commerce retailers could be some of the largest distributors
for the company."</font></font></font><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1></font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>With
recent events at Amazon, the company now believes that the electronic retail
market could be one of its largest sectors of distribution. This broad
market could include accounts such as online drugstores and other retailers,
such as the club stores, that have brick and mortar outlets as well as
thriving online sales. "With the global reach of the online market we have
the capability to span oceans and suddenly be retailing in Japan, which
already has a huge market for health and nutritional products," continued
Gallagher.</font></font></font><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1></font></font></font>
