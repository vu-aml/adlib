Thanks for your fast response.

I'm using R version 2.1.1 on OS X 10.3.9 to create the pdfs. I have tried viewing the pdf output in both Acrobat 6 and 7 (both display a white border around each polygon) as well as 
Preview (displays fine). I have emailed the pdf file to some correspondents running Windows, and they also see white borders when viewing with Acrobat (version unspecified).

I have tried using R version 2.4.0 on a G5 machine (which I can access remotely) running OS X 10.4.8, but the resulting pdf renders incorrectly (i.e. with a white border around each 
polygon) in both Acrobat *and* Preview. So it would appear that the combination of R 2.1.1 and OS X 10.3.9 gives slightly better results - although plots still appear incorrect when 
printed or viewed in Acrobat.

Unfortunately, I don't have access to a Windows machine to test this out. Even if I did, many of my scripts include various Unix system calls so I don't think that would be a viable 
solution. Could this be a bug in the OS X pdf driver?

Many thanks,


-Matt
