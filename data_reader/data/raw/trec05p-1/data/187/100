The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bu|l market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oil Be|t"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi||ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-We|| Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverable Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing field that was discovered and drilled 
by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The field is established with substantial recoverab|e 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi||ion barre|s of oi| and about 2 bi||ion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbol - EOGI
Price   - .075

The value of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bul|
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-mil|ions, EOGI is se|ling for less than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and developers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly c|ose attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l company
with a comparably small market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But a|| that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa||y exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wi|| the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
dec|ine
s|ightly, you will sti|l make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi|l
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be 
staggering.

Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares wil| surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are well estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this
area wil| real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu||etin.
