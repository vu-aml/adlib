Dear Friend, 

I love being home for the holidays. But this year, I’ll be traveling. The whole travel industry is offering great deals – cheap airfare, cut-rate cruises, discounted hotels, and bargain basement car rentals. President Bush said, "Fly and enjoy America's great destination spots," and that’s just what I’m going to do.

ASK THE EXPERT 

Q: We love to tailgate at football games but we don't want to buy special equipment just for a few outings. Anything we can use at home and away? – P.A.W. Jersey City, NJ 

A: Guess the gas powered Daiquiri blender and the jet-powered beer cooler aren't what you had in mind. Now there's a whole range of products that are convenient and safe to use both at home and at your next tailgater.

I recently went to my first tailgate party. WOW! It was a cross between a food festival and a gadget guru convention. Everybody had the "best" way to prepare something with perfect implements for the task – be it a blow torch or converted weed whacker. See our expert advice for a more sane approach to tailgating.
