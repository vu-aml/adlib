Dear Jess,

You're stuck in evening traffic. Your cell phone rings. 
It's your latest sales prospect. The one with the 
multi-million-dollar budget.

"Our CEO wants to review your proposal first thing 
tomorrow. Fax me a clean copy, would you?"

"It's on its way!" you say. Then you fire up Qxprint. 

Talk about convenience in a not-quite-paperless world. 
Qxprint essentially turns your wireless Palm(tm) 
handheld into a remote control and transmits selected 
documents from your PC to anyplace in the world.

Choose Print on demand, Fax, Email or even express mail 
to send proposals, letters and other important 
documents. It doesn't matter if you're five feet or 
five hundred miles from your office; Qxprint will take 
care of it. You can even upload your contacts* to the 
Qxprint Web site for easy access.

The price is right too--Qxprint charges a nominal fee 
for each transaction.
