Thersa,
I recalculated the August invoice and I am still coming up with a difference
between your invoice and my calculations.  The difference for August is
$18,713.96.  I am issuing a adjustment for the $18,713.96.  So, when the
funds are transferred to Enron, there will be two transactions that will net
$794,486.45.  
Also, I am not paying the additional $10,210.77 PPA for July.  When you
revise July's invoice, I will pay based on the revised invoice.  
I will take the invoices down to Accounting tomorrow after they have been
approved.  John is out today, but will be back in the office tomorrow.  I
will try to expedite payment tomorrow.
Can you please forward this to Valerie?  


Robert

Robert, Valerie,

I have revised the fuel percent from .0107 to .0078.  Please call me if
you have any questions.

Thanks,
Theresa

(I will start working on correcting all prior months and get an
adjustment out soon.)
