Karen and Steve:  Terrie James and I thought it appropriate to communicate the severance decision separately from vacation and the other benefits and community changes in the e-mail below, which we planned to send out tomorrow.  Due to the time line HR has planned for next week, we planned to send out the severance message Monday.  Can you give us some direction on this (see David's comment)? 

On another note, what messages will the press release contain?  This came up a meeting Sarah and I had with the HR team today.

Thanks.

We need to make sure the vacation component is tied in with severance decision which we haven't yet concluded. We need PR to help with deciding how we package these things.

The attached memo is to be distributed to all US-based employees this afternoon.  We've opted to include the various changes to HR policies and employee programs in one consolidated memo to reduce the number of negative e-mails employees receive over the next few weeks.  Please review at your earliest convenience and provide changes to me.  If  I do not receive changes from you by 3:30 p.m. today, I will assume you have none.

Thanks for your prompt reply,
