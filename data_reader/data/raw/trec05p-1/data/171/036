Good Morning,

My name is Mike Nielsen and I work for a Consulting firm in Phoenix Arizona
called Thor, Inc.  I have a favor to ask.  I have a client in Phoenix who is
looking for a Forward Trader(Dealing with Electricity, Natural Gas, and SO2
trading).  Extremely stable department, presently a dozen people and have
not had any turnover in 5+ years.  Position is full-time with a very nice
base 20% bonus and one of the best benefits packages I have ever seen.

Do you know who I might contact at Enron if any of the people who were
recently laid off, had this skill set?

Thanks for your help and have a great day,
Mike Nielsen
Senior Associate
