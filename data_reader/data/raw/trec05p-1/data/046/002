<DIV>FROM THE DESK OF MR KARBIRU AHMED.<BR>AUDITIN AND ACCOUNTIN
MANAGER,<BR>BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A)<BR>OUAGADOUGOU-BURKINA FASO.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>Dear Friend,</DIV>
<DIV>I am the AUDITIING AND ACCOUNTING MANAGER BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) here
in Ouagadougou,Burkina Faso.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum
of USD$14m(fourtheen million united states dollars).in an account that
belongs to one of our foreign customer(MR.ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich,
Germany)who died along with his entire family in Monday,31 July,2000, in a
plane crash.FOR MORE INFORMATION VISIT THIS SITE BELOW:&nbsp;&nbsp; <A
href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm</A></DIV>
<DIV><BR>Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting
his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release
it unlessn some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the
deceased as indicated in our banking<BR>guidlings and laws but unfortunately
we learnt that all his<BR>supposed next of kin or relation died alongside
with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.</DIV>
<DIV>It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this
business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or
relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody
is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury
as unclaimed<BR>bill.The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if
such money remained unclaimed after fours years, the money will be
transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. </DIV>
<DIV>The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned
by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and<BR>a Burkinabe cannot
stand as next of kin to a foreigner.</DIV>
<DIV>I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the
provision of a foriegn account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred
during the business and 60% would be for me Thereafter, I will visit your
country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to
enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply
first<BR>to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating
your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax
number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money
will be<BR>remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or
email the text of application .</DIV>
<DIV>I will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction is hitch-free
and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required
arrangements have been made for the transfer.</DIV>
<DIV>You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this
letter.Trusting to hear from you immediately.<BR>Yours Faithfully,</DIV>
<DIV>MR KARBIRU AHMED.(B.O.A)</DIV>
<DIV><BR>URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION AND CONFIDENCIAL<BR></DIV><BR />
