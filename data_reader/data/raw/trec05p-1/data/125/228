Hall Yoder Daily Assessment Index for Monday, November 12, 2001:   +3

A number of relatively positive factors are offset by the single negative factor that the good old days are forever gone. The free fall seems to have ended.   Lots of cash is coming in.  Portland office is apparently to be spared a misery that  Houston will not be so fortunate as to escape,  and is given a clear message to resume work as usual.  Street Oracle  carping and whining at low level of hysteria.   

Perhaps a key subliminal message can be divined from the fact that Tim went to Houston carrying  full documentation and prepared to hand in all of his expense reports, but came back without having turned anything in at all,   flying back home on the jetstream,  much like the single crow that sailed by today,  heading due north high above the center of the Willamette, as though it knew exactly where it was going.
