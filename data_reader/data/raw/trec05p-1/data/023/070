Johnny 

We met briefly in derivatives training.  I currently work in large bundled structuring providing a due diligence function.  I am customer interfacing and give assurance on data that I collect and distribute to the various groups that determine the structure, execute pricing, and even set-up invoicing.  I have a strong energy knowledge and excellent customer service background.  

I would very much like to discuss opportunities!
