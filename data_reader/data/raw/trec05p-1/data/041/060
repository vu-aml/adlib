The Republicans met with the Governor last night, who asked them to
produce 15 votes for the MOU.  Bill Leonard and Keith Richman were
taking on the task of convincing some Republicans to vote for the bill.
They assembled a group of amendments they want in exchange for the vote,
among which is our request to change the August 24th date to Sept 1 so
as not to jeopardize existing DA contracts.  The Republicans went into
caucus at 9:15 this morning and word just out is that they could muster
only 5 votes for the bill.  Now the liberal Democrats are putting
together amendments they want in order to vote for the bill and give the
needed number of votes for passage.  We have been unable to get their
agenda, although we're certain that environmental issues top the list.
We are shoring up moderate Democrats to remain supportive of direct
access language.  Appropriations Committee is starting momentarily to
hear the bill and we will keep you informed throughout the day.
