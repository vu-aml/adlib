Good morning sweetheart. 

I hope you slept well last night. I sure am happy that I got to be with you again last night. I missed you soooo much over the weekend.

I think we will be very happy together for a long time. :-) 
Do you want to go see a movie tonight? I was thinking about seeing "The Mothman Prophecies" at 4:35. How does that sound to you. Or we can just kick back and relax at home. I'm good either way.

I love you sweetheart. Have a good day and I'll see you when I get home.
