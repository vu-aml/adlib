Sara- I am sorry to hear Frank has left.. have you spoken to him, is he OK? How are you doing?

Can you please tell me how you are dealing with counterparties who still have exposure to Enron?

I know all contracts are null and void.. what is the process for them to take off deals.

The only counterparties I have with any exposure are:
tudor
wexford

I am asking for them specifically.

Also, on monies we owe counterparties.. like tudor and catequil, what is the process they must go through?

Thanks very much,
Caroline
