Claudia:

I received a Remedy (help desk) Ticket stating only that Eric could not get into StackManager on Terminal Server.  Upon calling him, I found out that he actually could get in but only after using his old password.  He is concerned that his new book is not linked up in StackManager.

Would you please contact him at your earliest time and assist him with his password and StackManager access?

Thank you,
