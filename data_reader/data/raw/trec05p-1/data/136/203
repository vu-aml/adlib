Hello,

It looks like very few people would show up for class this coming
Wednesday because of Thanksgiving plans. I have therefore decided to
cancel class and to put off the in-class project I had planned until the
Dec. 5th class (more details on that next week).

Have a great holiday.

Howard Shelanski
