Teb,  At one of the FERC meetings in January Nancy Bagot reported that the Commission did not extend the reporting requirements for sales and transportation into California.  I don't have a copy of the Order but I'm sure she could give you either a copy of the Order or the cite address.

Today's Inside FERC has a story indicating that the report for January business, to be filed March 1, will be the last report required (unless and until something else happens)?  Has anyone seen anything official on this?
