SubPenny!!! and a WiMax.  We love this combination...
Bringing Wireless Broadband Internet to the World
Ride the WiMAX wave now-or miss it
Stock Radar Presents,
WebSky, Inc.
OTC:WBSK

The WiMAX bandwagon is rolling and this could be your LAST CHANCE to find =
a bargain-price in this sector.  
So-listen up. 
We have one for you to watch right now and its a subpenny!

As I'm sure you know, 
WiMAX does for the last mile of broadband what Wi-Fi has done for the last=
 100 feet of networking:
drop the price to the point at which it becomes a MUST-HAVE for the mass m=
arket.
FIVE BILLION people is the market.

WebSky's business model involves providing wireless broadband internet ser=
vice to underserved domestic and international markets. (Brilliant in our =
opinion)

WBSK currently controls licensed radio frequencies in the highly sought af=
ter MMDS-band . 2.5GHz to 2.7GHz in seven small and medium sized cities in=
 the United States, this frequency range will be used for wireless broadba=
nd Internet.

Guess what?  Read this.....

WebSky, Inc. and World Wide Wireless -- India -- Enter into Definitive Joi=
nt Venture Agreement for Broadband Wireless Internet Project in India

The joint venture anticipates the launch of its first operations in India =
during the second quarter of 2005. WebSky India projects, based on modest =
market penetration assumptions along with continuing robust growth of the =
Internet in India, that annual revenues for the three initial locations in=
 the third year of operations will exceed $U.S. 45 million. (Partial clip =
only. This is major news for WBSK so you need to read it now.) Go to yahoo=
 financial for the complete news.


Congratulations to all who participated in our first two picks of the year=
, nearly a double on the first one and the second gained over 120=
% Tue. Jan. 18th. and still going strong. WBSK is our third pick for the n=
ew year.
we are on a huge winning streak right now, so put WBSK on your radar's rig=
ht now and start the WATCH immediately.  
This company may prove to be our best pick yet!  You never know..... Keep =
an eye out for more great news....


So keep an eye tomorrow on WBSK and get in to ride the tsunami! Get in ear=
ly while you can!
