Any luck on finished the Aug.  curve vals?  Unless you've already put the a report together, all we need to do for August is list the curves validated and whether or not there were any issues with the curves based on the work done. I can do this.  Can you come up with the summary statement similar to last month.  I'll put the comment and list together with the rest of the BU.  I'm putting the July report below for reference.  

 

Are you planning on doing the September curves (this Friday's the last day of the month)?
