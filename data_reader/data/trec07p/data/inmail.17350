Novartis wants drugs access overhaul

							Paul Herrling wants changes to the drugs access system (Keystone)

A Novartis executive has called for the
creation of a global taskforce to fund and distribute new drugs for
neglected diseases in developing countries.

Paul
Herrling, head of corporate research at the Swiss pharmaceutical giant,
told swissinfo the present system of supplying affordable medicines to
poor countries was problematic and unsustainable.



The supply of cut price or free medications is currently provided by
charitable programmes of pharmaceutical companies or via World Trade
Organization (WTO) rules allowing governments to override patents if
there is a strong public health case.

Novartis's current court
battle over patent protection for its leukaemia drug Gleevec in India
is the latest in a line of confrontations between companies,
governments and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on the issue.

Herrling
believes it is time to set up an independent non-political body of all
interested parties to tackle the thorny issue of access to medicine.

"This
is now dependent on our goodwill, but governments and NGOs would like
to see something more sustainable than the goodwill of big pharma
companies," he told swissinfo.

"This is a much more constructive
way to get everyone collaborating towards a solution as opposed to the
relatively simple war cry of 'shoot patents'".



Gleevec stumbling block



Herrling
suggests that firms could apply for funds to develop drugs for diseases
such as malaria and grant licenses for their use in that field, while
still retaining the patent for other commercial uses.

The idea
was recently presented to Médicins Sans Frontières (MSF), but the
Geneva-based NGO insists that Novartis must first end its Gleevec fight.

"We
welcome Professor Herrling's suggestions, but Novartis needs to
demonstrate their goodwill by stopping their court case in India," MSF
spokesman Pere Pons told swissinfo.

"Access to medicine should be driven by the needs of the people and not the needs of the market."

Gleevec
has fallen foul of an Indian ruling that patents cannot be applied to
modifications of existing discoveries, an interpretation that rides
roughshod over the established incremental development from molecule to
useable medicine. It also protects the thriving Indian generics
industry that copies drugs at much cheaper prices.

Novartis says
it is fighting to preserve innovation, while MSF has accused the
Basel-based firm of using patents to squeeze competitors to inflate
prices and profits.

Herrling said he could understand the
suspicion of NGOs like MSF after an ill-fated attempt by 39
pharmaceuticals, including Novartis, to fight South African measures to
reduce the price of certain drugs in the country. They eventually
withdrew their complaint in 2001.

Governments and NGOs would like to see something more sustainable than the goodwill of big pharma companies.

"Horrible" governments



"The industry has come quite a long way since then," he said.

"At
that time pharmas were convinced that if they were not fighting for
their profits at the exclusion of everything else their shareholders
would sell their shares. But there has been a significant change of
public opinion about the problems of the developing world."

Herrling is convinced that some governments need to change the way they do business with pharmaceuticals.

"Some
governments are amazing to work with but others are just horrible. The
extreme is a health minister who said 'Why should I save all these
children if I have to feed them all later?'"

"We believe in
innovative public-private partnerships. We hope that the governments
that work with us will build more successful countries and that will
set an example for the others."

But, above all, Herrling believes the emphasis should shift from rows over patents to a more positive approach.

"My
experience is that patents save lives because without patents no one
would have anything to copy because no one would invest in innovative
research any more," he said.

swissinfo, Matthew Allen
