Some info is available through the city website.  Details for qualification
and application are very similar to the prevailing building line ordinance.

Basic rule is that 75% of the lots on a pair of opposing blockfaces must be
within 10% of the average lot size in order for the city to define that
there exists a prevailing lot size.

Applicants must show support for a prevailing lot size of more than 50% of
the owners of the lots in question, and submit their application to the
city.  Application must include maps showing the area applied for, the lot
sizes, and the land usage in each lot (commercial/residential/vacant). 

For information, contact Hector Rodriguez in City Planning and Development:
713 837 7816.

Subject: *EMCA* City lot size ordinance


Hello all,  Lorraine and I have been unable to get ourselves down to 
the meetings lately.  Being new parents has us pretty exhausted but 
we are getting the hang of it.  Tyler James is growing so fast.  
Maybe next month we will make it.  

Anyway, we did have a question about the newly adopted city lot size 
ordinance that was passed in December.  Is there something printed 
that specifically addresses how this affects our neighborhood?  Do we 
know what the average lot size is in Montrose?  Does this mean that 
no more old classic homes can be torn down to build 3 townhomes?

Also, we were wondering if anyone has noticed the parking problems 
lately due to the Eclesiastic church on Taft?  They seem to provide 
no parking for their events which seem to occur more often every 
month.  They have done alot of work on that church and I have never 
noticed one single permit posted on their structure.  We don't really 
know these people and have nothing against them but don't they need 
to comply with city parking and building codes?

Maybe these issues can be addressed in next months newsletter?
