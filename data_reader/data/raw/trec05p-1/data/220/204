	I talked with Barb Bishoff who is setting up the Measurement
	meeting for Mary Kay and Dave Neubauer.  She said it will
	probably be next week since she is having trouble getting both
	Mary Kay and Dave at the same time.  

	I told her it was critical that Shelley be in the meeting.

	I told her Steve, Rick and I are optional for this discussion.

	Thanks. Lynn
