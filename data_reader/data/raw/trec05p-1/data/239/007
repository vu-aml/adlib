Positive Effects of [H-G-H] Replacement

1. GET LEAN: Loss of fat and increase in muscle mass combine for up to 20 =
pound shift in body composition. This equates to a general feeling of phys=
ical well being, a stronger libido, and improved self image.
2. GET ENERGETIC: Without a need for the afternoon food cravings of sweets=
, caffeine, stimulants or nicotine, HGH patients have more energy. This im=
proves both their self control image and their general health state (becau=
se they exercise).
3. GET SMART: An interesting yet unproved side-effect of HGH has been the =
return of mental acuity and a "sharp" memory. Such HGH improves the vascul=
ar and intracellular nutrient support for cells, it is not surprizing that=
 this has been reported by many individuals.
