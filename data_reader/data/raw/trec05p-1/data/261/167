-- Citibank House, 336 Strand, 
London WC2R 1HB, United 
Kingdon, London.
 
I am MR.Benard Frasier, Regional Manager of Citibank International plc London. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the UNITED KINGDOM Mining Corporation, Mr. JOSEPH WALLACE made a numbered time  (Fixed)Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I  sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. 
 
After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  contract employers, the UNITED KINGDOM Mining Corporation that Mr. JOSEPH WALLACE died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of  kin was fruitless.I therefore made further  investigation and discovered  that Mr. JOSEPH WALLACE did not declare any kin or relations in all his  official documents,
 
 including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) is still  sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.No one will ever come forward to claim it.
According to UNITED KINGDOM LAW, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the UNITED KINGDOM Government if  nobody applies to claim the fund.
 
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to  stand in as the next of kin to Mr. JOSEPH WALLACE so that the fruits of this  old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of  kin.We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. 
 
A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money  to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your  account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by  the Attorney and my position as the Regional Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your  response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country through your company.
 
Awaiting your urgent reply via my email
 
Thanks and regards.
