Hey, its Katie.  You answered my personal ad, sorry it took so long to get back!

Well, I am sitting at home doing nothing.  I don't know if you are
interested still, or if you found someone so I don't want to write much.  I have been playing on my web cam for a few days.  If you want to chat with me, I'm usually online after work.  You don't have to have one, but it makes it more fun.  I'll still talk to you, though if you don't.  Here is how you can get a hold of me.

There is a thing on there that tells when I'm online.  Email me if you have any problems.  We can chat on AOL the old fashion way if this doesn't work out.
Have a fun weekend!
Katie

IMPORTANT TIPS TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS AT Match.com: 

If you use the "reply" button to respond to this message, please take the following steps:

1.  DELETE ALL TEXT from the body of your message, including header information which may include your actual email address.

2.  REMOVE ANY AUTOMATIC SIGNATURES which may include your personal contact information.

Our anonymous re-mailer will strip away your real email address (in the From: field), so that it will NOT appear in the "From:" line. However, DO NOT use the "Cc:" or "Bcc:" fields as these addresses CANNOT be stripped away.

You may also contact this person from their Match.com profile by clicking "Contact this person" and composing your message directly from the site.
