Hi John,


Here is your report for today. 

I also need to get your opinion on the following matter. 

We have been  working on a new look and feel for EnronOnline that includes expanded order functionality. This was expected to be released sometime in January. We think going ahead will act as an indicator that as far as our core businesses are concerned it is business as usual and we are contiuing to develop the platform.

Before proceeding however we would like to get your opinion on  whether this is something we should even be considering at this point . I also have some screen shots that I will bring by after trading for you to take a look at. I aprreciate your help. 


 
Savita
