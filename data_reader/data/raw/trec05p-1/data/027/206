Since Sharron Westbrook has been the person providing notices regarding our EES/EWS Thursday meetings, I have forwarded this suggested language to her to use in notifiying all attendees of our planned changes for the meeting.  You and I discussed resuming the meetings during the first week in September  - I have indicated that we will resume the meetings during the second week.  Beth Apollo has had a house under construction since her return from London and should be moving in on September 1st.  She plans to take off that week to get moved in and settled, and to start her 2 year-old into her new school.  We could try to patch Beth in by phone that week, but I think we would be better off having her here.  So I made an "executive" decision to resume the next week, on September 13.  That will also give me time to get with you during the first week in September, while Beth is out, to review with you the reporting tools that we will have developed for use in the meetings.  Hope that all of this is okay with you. 

I have left Rick Causey and Dan Leff messages regarding the outcome of our discussions last week regarding this Thursday meeting.    

Beth and I have set aside time on Thursday this week to devise appropriate tracking and reporting tools to use in the meeting.  -Sally

The weekly EES/EWS meeting with Rick Causey, Rick Buy and Dan Leff on Thursdays from 3:00 - 4:00 pm in EB3321 is being revamped to insure that the agenda and format for the meeting are organized to maximize the benefit from these recurring meetings.  In reviewing the availability of key players over the next several weeks and to allow time to create meaningful tracking documents for critical milestones, the Thursday meetings will be cancelled from now through the first week in September.  The meeting will resume beginning Thursday, September 13 from 3:00 to 4:00 and will be held every other week from that point forward.   You will be notified prior to the resumption of these meetings in September if you need to put this on your calendar as a recurring meeting.  The list of attendees is being reviewed, with the possibility of reducing the number of attendees in an effort to utilize people's time wisely and to create an atmosphere for frank dialogue regarding progress.
