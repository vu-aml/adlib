Tom:

Per my discussion with you this morning, please coordinate with each of the book administrators (and other appropriate personnel) and explain the process for compilation of the counterparty trading exposure data for the EGM commodity trading businesses. The attachments are the templates for listing the counterparties and corresponding trading exposure data. This approach will put the EGM information on the same playing field with power and gas. This will also help with the forthcoming Ernst & Young/Creditors' Committee discussions about valuations and potential settlements with counterparties.

Further to our meeting yesterday attached is an Excel spreadsheet and a form for document review for non-terminated contracts. In order that the review we do of the contracts and information we obtain can be put to best use for both legal and commercial purposes, you will need to input information into BOTH the spreadsheet and the document review form.
	
Don Miller will be advising shortly as to the contact person in his team to whom all the completed spreadsheets and document review forms, in electronic form, should be sent. In addition the document review form should, once completed, be printed out and attached to the front of the relevant contract. For the moment please keep all contracts assigned to you until we decide who should keep and manage these contracts going forward.
	
We are working towards a Monday close of business deadline for the East for completion of this legal review process. I understand that the contracts for the West have not arrived yet and therefore propose that we obtain an update from Christian and Steve on their progress on Tuesday, recognising that Monday is an unrealistic deadline for them.
