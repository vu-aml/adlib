I am Mr.charles soludo a consulting auditor,NedBank
Plc,Johannesburg-South Africa.During the course of my
auditing work with my client bank late last year, I
discovered an account worth 25,400.000.00 opened in the
bank in 1998 by a Foreigner, a German, Late Mr.Andreas
Schranner
([http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm).

It is because of the perceived possibility of not being
able to locate any of Late Mr. Andreas Schranner next of
kin known to the bank, according to the immigration data
available to the bank,that i contacted you to stand in as
the next of kin. 

I have secretly discussed this matter with a close
confident attorney whom I must involve in order to assist
us produce legal back-up documents which would substantiate
claims/position of next of kin and also enable us have a
smooth and successful transfer of the fund to any foreign
bank account which you are going to nominate.All validating
and authenticating documents to enable you get this fund
will be carefully worked out. We have secured from the
probate registry, an order of Mandamus to locate any of the
deceased beneficiaries and that makes this business 100%
Risk Free. 

The sharing ratio after completion of transfer will be
thus: 60% for me, 35% for you and 5% for expensies.
Kindly indicate your interest to enable us, with your
assistance,move the fund to the banks offshore clearing
houses in Europe. Please note that for the purposes of
confidentiality, all further correspondence should be
through my alternative email: soludo211@yahoo.com.au

Accept my warm regards as I await your response. 

Sincerely,

Mr.soludo charles.
