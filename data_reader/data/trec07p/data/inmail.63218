So the chinese might have a sentence like:
thequickbrownfoxjumpedoverthefence
and it's up to you, the reader, to figure out where the spaces are?

Well, for phonetic, character based langauges it's trying to do
something like:
while($string=~/(\w+)/g) {
  push @array, $1;
}
would be a great start.
Similarly I guess @array=~split /\W/, $string would be close.
