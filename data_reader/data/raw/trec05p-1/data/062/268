             2             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Let's go back on the record.
             3   Good morning, everyone.  This is a continuation of the oral
             4   argument we initiated on September 20, which started out as
             5   an oral argument because there was a motion to compel and
             6   also there was a question of a trial stipulation with
             7   regard to grouping that appeared to raise some
             8   controversy.  So this meeting was framed as an oral
             9   argument rather than a conference.
            10             There are a few things I would like to do this
            11   morning.  Once we start, I will take any additional
            12   appearances from those people who are hooked up by video
            13   and those by phone so we know who you are and who you are
            14   representing.
            15             I would like to initially understand whether we
            16   need to address at some point during the conference
            17   Mr. Stickman's motion to compel or whether that's been
            18   informally involved, and if so, can we deem the motion
            19   withdrawn.
            20             Beyond that I would then turn to the ISO and
            21   understand their report from it with regard to its
            22   experience when the trial runs, and its view of the amount
            23   of time necessary to complete the data production process
            24   with regard to the four areas of data that we talked about
            25   last time, and particularly data requiring manual
0528
             1   adjustment with regard to O&M purchases where it was
             2   suggested that it might require an additional four weeks to
             3   as much as eight weeks in order to make those corrections,
             4   which the ISO in fact supported having done.
             5             I would also at that point, if it's necessary to
             6   address revisions in the trial schedule, I would like to
             7   take that up and understand what the parties have in mind.
             8   Beyond that, it seems to me that it's appropriate to do
             9   several additional things to the existing schedule and/or
            10   any revised schedule.  I would like to understand and have
            11   explicitly an indication in the trial schedule at what
            12   points the ISO and the PX are going to file testimony in
            13   support of that.
            14             Now, I would like to talk about the need for a
            15   conference for the ISO and/or the PX to explain their
            16   supporting data, a concern raised by the Staff with regard
            17   to the ISO, and so that it and its technical personnel and
            18   perhaps others can fully appreciate and understand the
            19   computerized data that's been provided to date on numerous
            20   CDs and will be corrected.
            21             It also seems appropriate to me, depending upon
            22   where we are going and given the time constraints, that we
            23   consider the addition to the schedule of scoping
            24   conferences after each evidentiary filing within a
            25   reasonable period of time, to understand exactly what
0529
             1   issues might be raised and the amount of time that might be
             2   required for cross-examination.  That can be ultimately
             3   refined as it is in the current schedule.
             4             Then there may be some other business we may need
             5   to take up that you have on your minds that I haven't
             6   thought of.  So that's what I would like to accomplish, and
             7   hopefully we can do that and adjourn by lunchtime although
             8   accomplishing even simple things with as many parties
             9   appears to take a little bit longer.
            10             In any event, why don't we start with those
            11   parties who are on phone, who can hook up, identifying
            12   themselves and who they represent.  We don't need the
            13   telephone numbers, we already have that, unless there's an
            14   additional appearance you wish to enter, and then we can
            15   turn to the video conference participants and understand
            16   who they are and then we can go on with the agenda I
            17   indicated.
            18             MR. GALLAGHER:  This is Sean Gallagher for the
            19   California Public Utilities Commission.
            20             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Good morning.  Anybody else on
            21   the phone?
            22             MR. PATRIZIO:  Good morning, your Honor.  Mark
            23   Patrizio with the Pacific Gas & Electric Company.
            24             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Good morning.
            25             MS. MAHMUD:  Good morning, Diana Mahmud for
0530
             1   the --
             2             MR. BERMAN:  Dan Berman for the Pacific Gas &
             3   Electric Company.
             4             MS. MAHMUD:  Diana Mahmud for the Metropolitan
             5   Water District.
             6             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Anyone else by phone wish to
             7   identify themselves?  If we have anybody on video hookup
             8   who wish to identify themselves, we can do so although the
             9   screen looks blank.
            10             Let me understand from Mr. Stickman or his
            11   client, whoever is representing them today, whether there
            12   is a need at some point during this conference to address
            13   the motion to compel.
            14             Mr. Allen, good morning.
            15             MR. ALLEN:  Good morning, your Honor, I hope.  My
            16   name is Donald R. Allen for Mr. Stickman's clients.
            17             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Your client.
            18             MR. ALLEN:  Your Honor, we circulated last week
            19   the trial stipulation which had some procedures in it for
            20   people, informally we circulated it, which we believe would
            21   take care of the issue of grouping and process.  The
            22   schedule we discuss this morning bifurcates the proceeding,
            23   and I have prepared and submitted to the list serve a
            24   similar trial stipulation that would change the dates.
            25             I don't know whether the list serve got out.  I
0531
             1   have 40 copies of what I sent to the list serve and I would
             2   be happy to distribute them now.  I represent that there is
             3   only bifurcation and bifurcation dates included.  If that's
             4   acceptable or acceptable revisions of that process, that
             5   would dispense with the motion.
             6             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Do you have an understanding
             7   whether there is a consensus with regard to that?
             8             MR. ALLEN:  No, your Honor, we were so taken up
             9   with initially Burbank related -- but I don't think they
            10   turned out to be directly Burbank-related issues last
            11   week.  We never got to the simple process question and I
            12   have not had a chance to get a consensus.  The nonpublic
            13   utility groups are of one mind on it.
            14             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Can I have a show of hands of
            15   any participants who are here today who may not have been
            16   provided with a copy of the draft stipulation.  If you
            17   would be kind enough to distribute it and also provide me
            18   with two copies and my law clerk with one, I think it might
            19   help the discussion.
            20             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Acker.
            21             MR. ACKER:  Your Honor, if I may, I thought your
            22   inquiry to Mr. Allen was directed to a Burbank motion to
            23   compel.
            24             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Data from the ISO.
            25             MR. ACKER:  Yes, I understood Mr. Allen to be
0532
             1   responding about a procedurally distinct matter.
             2             PRESIDING JUDGE:  I appreciate that.  We can go
             3   back on --
             4             MR. ALLEN:  I'm sorry, I didn't hear.
             5             PRESIDING JUDGE:  I asked about the motion to
             6   compel data from the ISO, whether that has been resolved.
             7             MR. STICKMAN:  I am Jon Stickman for the city of
             8   Burbank, Imperial Irrigation District, Turlock Irrigation
             9   District and the city of Glendale.
            10             MR. ALLEN:  And I am with him.
            11             PRESIDING JUDGE:  We seem to have the video
            12   conference hooked up.  For those people who are
            13   participating by video conference, would you be kind enough
            14   to identify yourself and whom you are representing please.
            15             I don't know if we have a problem with that yet.
            16             MR. SMIGIELSKI:  I think we don't have audio
            17   yet.  We are still working.
            18             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Do we have someone from the
            19   hearing room or here on line?
            20             Good morning, Mr. Jordan, I didn't satisfy you.
            21   Perhaps you would be kind enough to advise all of us what
            22   your experience with trial runs on manual adjusted data we
            23   talked about, what that appears to have demonstrated, and
            24   if you believe that it would require an adjustment of the
            25   data production process to ensure that everyone has the
0533
             1   data that the Commission required to be provided, what you
             2   believe is necessary and why.
             3             MR. JORDAN:  Yes, your Honor.  It was reported to
             4   me, after some efforts have been made, to look into what
             5   was involved in going into the manual adjustments on the
             6   OOM called, that the people in settlement believe it will
             7   take eight weeks to do that.  In addition, they believe it
             8   will take one week to prepare the CD-ROMs and explanatory
             9   material to distribute to the parties, so we are really
            10   talking about a nine-week period.
            11             At the last conference we talked about also the
            12   three weeks.
            13             PRESIDING JUDGE:  We are having problems with the
            14   video.  If you would continue on.
            15             MR. JORDAN:  No problem.  We talked about the
            16   three weeks to run the billing and settlements, the
            17   automated part to deal with what we referred to as a
            18   computer setting.  I learned afterwards what will really
            19   happen, let me back up.  What happened the previous time in
            20   running the automated process was that the ISO used several
            21   different servers, big computers, and ran in parallel
            22   different dates.  They were able to run billing and
            23   settlements for more than one day at a time.
            24             As I understand it, because they now need to put
            25   in these manually adjusted OOMS day by day, they now have
0534
             1   to run the billing and settlements day by day also so
             2   that -- that three-week period, so that process of running
             3   the automated part of billing and settlements will be going
             4   on simultaneously with the eight weeks that it takes to
             5   enter these OOMS manually.  So that that should be done as
             6   well in that nine-week period that I was talking about, but
             7   it can't be done earlier.  We can't get those, that rerun,
             8   earlier because it has to take into account this OOM
             9   process as well.
            10             PRESIDING JUDGE:  So that would be done the
            11   nine-week period, at least the material would be
            12   distributed in the nine weeks, and I think we are talking
            13   November 30 because by the time they get started, it will
            14   be late this week.
            15             The entry of the rest of the resolved disputes
            16   which I mentioned is taking 10 days at the last conference,
            17   my understanding is they will all be entered so that this
            18   run that we are talking about will include all of the
            19   resolved disputes.
            20             PRESIDING JUDGE:  The run, when you say "the
            21   run," are we talking about the run at the end of nine weeks
            22   or can we get the resolved dispute data out within the
            23   next, within this week or the next week and a half?
            24             MR. JORDAN:  I am not sure.  When I said the run,
            25   I mean when this computer run reaches the -- toward the end
0535
             1   of the refund period that ends on June 20, by the time it
             2   reaches that, all of these resolved disputes will have been
             3   entered for those trade days so that the run will pick up
             4   these resolved disputes.
             5             In terms of separately distributing all of the
             6   resolved disputes, to be quite candid, I haven't had any
             7   discussion with them since last week about doing that.  I
             8   may have misunderstood whether that was to be separately
             9   distributed or not.  If I did, I apologize.  And we can
            10   discuss it this morning, but I was just focused on whether
            11   they would be included in the run.
            12             PRESIDING JUDGE:  So to understand when a
            13   computer run reaches the end of June 20, when can we expect
            14   that?
            15             MR. JORDAN:  Eight weeks, because in doing this
            16   next run, they will have to enter the OOM manuals in order
            17   to get the effect of those into the refund calculation, so
            18   that everything will be paced by the work on those OOM
            19   calculations.
            20             PRESIDING JUDGE:  There is a fourth category
            21   relating to penalties which had not been provided to the
            22   participants but had been agreed to be provided, and we
            23   were told that required manual adjustments and was expected
            24   to be completed this week, if my notes are correct.
            25             MR. JORDAN:  That's correct, your Honor.  As far
0536
             1   as I know, that is on schedule.
             2             PRESIDING JUDGE:  So the process you envision
             3   will require a total of nine weeks, as you have indicated,
             4   and can't be done without distribution prior to November
             5   30.
             6             MR. JORDAN:  That's correct.
             7             PRESIDING JUDGE:  That's the earliest possible
             8   date.
             9             MR. JORDAN:  That's conceivable.  As it looks
            10   now, something will happen as we go along, but the work
            11   they started last weekend, well, they started immediately
            12   after the last conference.  It looks like they need the
            13   entire eight weeks plus a week to distribute because it
            14   will be a massive distribution again.
            15             PRESIDING JUDGE:  What additional measures, if
            16   any, is the ISO planning to take to make sure that we don't
            17   find ourselves in this predicament in a very short period
            18   of time?
            19             Is there going to be some kind of spot-checking
            20   every couple of days to make sure that the data is being
            21   entered and it's there so that the cumulative process at
            22   the end of eight weeks is complete or is there some other
            23   specific measures the ISO plans to take so that the
            24   participants can be reassured that we can finally complete
            25   the data production process and let the PX get on with its
0537
             1   function and then the participants get on with the
             2   evidentiary presentations required by the Commission?
             3             MR. JORDAN:  I hope that video conference comes
             4   up, because I don't know how one would go about checking as
             5   they go.  I do know that there is discussion with the ISO,
             6   I don't know when it has ultimately wound up, about doing
             7   this run, particularly the manual adjustments, in such a
             8   way that if it becomes necessary to run them again, as it
             9   would, if the mitigated price should be changed as a result
            10   of hearing, it would all be automated and next time through
            11   would not take eight weeks.
            12             As I said, I saw e-mail traffic on an effort to
            13   do that.  I don't know if it's been reached, reached
            14   fruition, and they know that they can do it in such a way
            15   that it could be done all automated the next time around.
            16   That's something we should explore this morning if they
            17   come on.
            18             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Gentile, you last advised
            19   us, because of what had transpired and the fact that we
            20   learned there were about 80 days over a period of three to
            21   four months where mitigated clearing price data needed to
            22   be corrected, which affected the PX's function, that the PX
            23   would need the same amount of time as it had been accorded
            24   in the trial schedule to complete its responsibilities, and
            25   you suggested that would be about three to four weeks.
0538
             1             My rough calculation on my calendar suggests that
             2   four weeks brings us to about December 18 for the PX to
             3   provide its final data.  Is that an appropriate assumption
             4   on this scenario?
             5             MR. GENTILE:  Your Honor, it is not.  I saw the
             6   three to four weeks in a document which Staff circulated
             7   but attributed to you.  I was surprised by the three- to
             8   four-week period; if I said three to four weeks, I
             9   misspoke.
            10             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Excuse me, I may have
            11   misspoken, four to six.
            12             MR. GENTILE:  Yes, your Honor.
            13             PRESIDING JUDGE:  So four would bring us out to
            14   December 18 and six would bring us out to the first of the
            15   year, roughly.  Are we still talking that time period,
            16   assuming it's determined that it's appropriate to take the
            17   period of time the ISO has suggested or whatever the PX
            18   needs to have done in a somewhat shorter period?
            19             MR. GENTILE:  I would have to say no on both
            20   counts.  First, I think the ISO will complete its data
            21   production on the 30th of November.  Four weeks would then
            22   take us to December 31, which is the day before New
            23   Year's.  In discussions yesterday, we indicated that in the
            24   circumstances, we thought that an appropriate day for us to
            25   provide our initial data would be January 7.
0539
             1             PRESIDING JUDGE:  When you say "initial data,"
             2   what was dubbed preliminary in the prior trial schedule?
             3             MR. GENTILE:  Yes, your Honor.
             4             PRESIDING JUDGE:  To provide the final, you will
             5   find what we reference is your final data.
             6             MR. GENTILE:  We were looking to January 22, your
             7   Honor.
             8             PRESIDING JUDGE:  The reasons why we need that
             9   amount of time, Mr. Gentile, in your view?
            10             MR. GENTILE:  Basically, Judge, what we are doing
            11   is going back to square one, we cannot take advantage of
            12   any of the work that's already been done.  We are
            13   confronting a brand-new task.  This task will require us to
            14   go through the same processes, or at least equivalent
            15   processes that the ISO must go through, although we do so
            16   with more restricted resources.
            17             Working as fast as the California Power Exchange
            18   can, working with the data which it would obtain from the
            19   ISO -- by the way, we will be working with ISO data before
            20   November 31 -- we anticipate receiving data from the ISO
            21   and will begin working with it.  But even with that receipt
            22   of data, it still will take us the full time period that I
            23   indicated.
            24             Now, there is -- there are, I will acknowledge,
            25   that there are -- there is a very brief period hooked into
0540
             1   this schedule to encompass the holiday period, Christmas
             2   and New Year's.  For a brief period, within that time
             3   frame, some of the ISO people, the Power Exchange people
             4   will not be dedicated solely to the work on this case.
             5             PRESIDING JUDGE:  They will be delivering
             6   Christmas presents.
             7             MR. GENTILE:  Yes, your Honor.  All right.  I was
             8   also asked to state by the Power Exchange and to advise the
             9   parties and your Honor, that while we think this schedule
            10   is doable and feasible from our perspective, we cannot
            11   guarantee our existence beyond January 1.  We are working
            12   with a diminishing pool of resources and at some point in
            13   time, absent an initiative to fund the Power Exchange, it
            14   will not be able to continue its activities.  That's
            15   something that the parties should factor into their
            16   planning.  We have indicated that there are options
            17   available should we have to discontinue our activities.
            18             The other thing, the Power Exchange is looking
            19   toward alternative means.  It has very substantial assets,
            20   but its ability to generate income and use income from
            21   those assets for purposes of carrying out its role in this
            22   proceeding and other proceedings in which it is a part of
            23   is problematic and needs to be established by the
            24   appropriate judicial authorities, and indeed, the
            25   Commission itself may need to address this at some point.
0541
             1             PRESIDING JUDGE:  I was going to ask, it's nice
             2   for this body to understand constraints in which you are
             3   operating, but given the nature of the Commission's order
             4   and its responsibilities required of the PX, I think it
             5   would be incumbent upon the PX as promptly as possible to
             6   advise the Commission of this concern which relates to and
             7   may affect completion of the data process, even if nothing
             8   else changed in the current schedule.
             9             You alluded to this last time.  I think you might
            10   have even alluded to it at the prehearing conference before
            11   that and in a more oblique way.  But I think it's important
            12   that the Commission understand that there may be some
            13   further limitations on the PX's ability to provide data,
            14   one that is already required and any further data that the
            15   Commission might require of the PX in light of whatever
            16   determinations it makes on rehearing, because if the
            17   Commission authority is necessary in some respects to
            18   facilitate the PX's responsibilities, that's something that
            19   the Commission needs to address and it should begin
            20   focusing on that problem, it seems to me, as soon as
            21   possible.
            22             That's something beyond my reach unless -- and if
            23   funding became necessary, there was something that I could
            24   do within my powers under the rules if the parties agreed
            25   to participate.  I don't understand your concerns with
0542
             1   regard to funding and what limitations you are operating
             2   under now, so I just would make a rather broad statement in
             3   that regard.
             4             MR. GENTILE:  Your Honor, this matter has been
             5   under discussion at the Power Exchange, but your counsel is
             6   very well taken and we will again address this matter.  I
             7   think we are at the point now where we need to achieve a
             8   resolution and your remarks, I think, will be useful and
             9   assist us, for us to figure out a game plan that will
            10   enable us to do what we need to do and to play our role in
            11   this proceeding and the other proceedings in which we are a
            12   party.
            13             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Let me suggest that any further
            14   report I might make to the Commission which alludes to your
            15   concerns should not be considered by the PX as a substitute
            16   for the PX explaining in detail what its concerns are and
            17   what its potential limitations on funding may be and what
            18   role or authorizations might be necessary depending upon
            19   developments there from the Commission as opposed to
            20   external sources.
            21             MR. GENTILE:  Yes, your Honor.  What is involved
            22   in part is the sort of complex interplay between the
            23   Commission and the bankruptcy court, but we will -- again,
            24   your advice is well taken and we will take some steps to
            25   try to address these matters.
0543
             1             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Let me ask for those people who
             2   are participating by video conference:  Now that we seem to
             3   have the hook up accomplished, if you can hear me, would
             4   you be kind enough simply to identify yourself and whom you
             5   are representing.
             6             MR. GOLDBERG:  Alex Goldberg with Williams.  I
             7   can hear you just fine now.
             8             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Good.  Anyone else?
             9             MS. WATTS:  Yes, your Honor.  Jean Watts
            10   representing the California Independent System Operator.  I
            11   have Eric Hildebrandt with me and I will let the other
            12   people introduce themselves.
            13             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you.
            14             MR. SALTMARSH:  Good morning, your Honor.  Erik
            15   Saltmarsh with the California Electricity Oversight Board
            16   and the California State Parties Group.
            17             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Good morning.
            18             MS. JUBIEN:  Sidney Jubien also with the
            19   Oversight Board and California Parties.
            20             MS. WHITNEY:  Good morning, your Honor.  Vickie
            21   Whitney with California State Attorneys Office and
            22   California Parties.
            23             PRESIDING JUDGE:  I would like to thank all of
            24   you for rising so early so you could participate in today's
            25   conference.  And anyone else whom we haven't touched upon
0544
             1   yet.  Yes, sir.  Anyone else?
             2             All right.  So let's go back to the concerns
             3   expressed by the ISO and the needs expressed by the PX.
             4   And let me understand whether anyone would like to inquire
             5   further of the ISO with regard to its explanation and has
             6   related concerns, and if not, understand what participants
             7   may have in mind to accommodate the concerns we have just
             8   heard in terms of the data production process before we
             9   turn to related adjustments that would have to be made to
            10   the trial schedule with regard to the evidentiary process
            11   the Commission has required.
            12             Anyone have a question of the ISO in terms of
            13   Mr. Jordan's expression -- Mr. Fergus.
            14             MR. FERGUS:  Your Honor, I wonder if we might
            15   inquire, since there is some uncertainty as to whether you
            16   are going to develop a new process, automated process, to
            17   do the manual adjustments and perhaps some things out of
            18   your regular programming, would it be possible to get an
            19   understanding up front of the formulas that are going to be
            20   used?  In other words, as you go into this process and you
            21   have locked down what you are going to do, advise the
            22   parties, this is how we are doing it, so we can have our
            23   experts look at it?  If somebody has a problem, we can do
            24   it before we get very far along the way.  In other words,
            25   it's not trying to participate necessarily and how you do
0545
             1   it.  But once you have locked it down, make that public and
             2   available to us so that we can -- just another look, if you
             3   will.
             4             MR. JORDAN:  In terms of the formulas and that
             5   type of thing, I honestly don't know if they exist or
             6   whether it's all in a machine or whether something can be
             7   brought out in a machine.  We have been thinking of making
             8   sure that people understand at least, at least some high
             9   level of what will be done this time.  I think we will send
            10   out a list serve saying okay the button is pushed, this is
            11   what will be done.
            12             If I might ask the people in Folsom, because it's
            13   related to what you said up front, I think before you came
            14   on line, Folsom, I had reported that it was my
            15   understanding that the ISO billing and settlements people
            16   were at least trying to determine whether there is a way to
            17   automate the manual adjustments to the OOMS so that if they
            18   have to be redone again with a new mitigated price, or for
            19   some reason down the road it would not be an eight-week
            20   process the next time around, but perhaps closer to the
            21   normal -- it's not a normal process -- but a three-week
            22   process of being able to run things, automated and in
            23   parallel.  I had seen some e-mail traffic about that being
            24   looked into.  I just wondered if any conclusion had been
            25   reached on whether that was possible.
0546
             1             Maybe you could also address the question that
             2   was asked about whether there was a way to distribute what
             3   was referred to as "the formulas" or something to show
             4   people what was going to be done this time around, so that
             5   if people saw something they wanted to question, they could
             6   do so ahead of time.  I just don't know if that's a
             7   possibility or feasible.
             8             Is anyone there who can speak to either of those
             9   things?
            10             MR. GERBER:  Yes, Mr. Gerber here, your Honor.  I
            11   apologize for walking in late, but we have been trying to
            12   get ready for the FERC enforcement Staff.  If I understand
            13   the question, there was a question about the ability to
            14   automate the process by which we include the line item
            15   entry; is that correct?
            16             MR. JORDAN:  Yes.  So if it was done again later,
            17   it wouldn't be an eight-week process.
            18             MR. GERBER:  Unfortunately, it's almost
            19   impossible to do that.  There is, I think when we looked,
            20   there's about 1.8 million manual entries in this refund
            21   period.  What we don't have the advantage of doing, that we
            22   might be able to do, is because each price is treated
            23   separate and independently, there's no clear way to
            24   automate to make sure if it is changed to the unmitigated
            25   price, whether or not the second path encroaches on the
0547
             1   actual market clearing price.  To the extent that that
             2   doesn't happen, we have to go back and treat each one of
             3   these individually as we do in this first task.
             4             At this time, there doesn't seem to be a lot of
             5   efficiency gained in trying to put this in a form that we
             6   can easily regenerate.
             7             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Is there anything that can be
             8   done to ensure the public that if problems develop, we
             9   learn of them as soon as possible?  Would a weekly status
            10   report on what -- Mr. Jordan has said would take eight
            11   weeks and another week to distribute the data, would a
            12   weekly status report be helpful in understanding if any
            13   problems are occurring that might impede provision of the
            14   data within the eight to nine weeks that Mr. Jordan has
            15   mentioned, so that if something needs to be addressed we
            16   can do it at that point, rather than learn a long time
            17   after there are some problems and certain additional things
            18   are required?
            19             MR. GERBER:  No, we could certainly do that as we
            20   learn how it's going, the progress report, even to the
            21   extent that we could tell you if we are on track, ahead of
            22   track or slightly behind.  The only cautioning thing there
            23   is that I think that when we get -- the toughest period
            24   where the majority of manual entries is probably in the
            25   first part of December.  So it could potentially go very
0548
             1   smooth, very fast in the October, November time frame but I
             2   certainly anticipate that when we get to December that is
             3   when the real challenge is.
             4             MR. JORDAN:  When you say "December," are you
             5   talking trade date of December 2000?
             6             MR. GERBER:  Yes, trade date, I am hoping we will
             7   be past the month of December 2001.
             8             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Does it make sense to provide
             9   some of the data on a monthly basis, as it's developed,
            10   rather than wait until the end of an eight-week period for
            11   the ISO to make a cumulative distribution or do you need
            12   the entire data to understand where the lay of the land --
            13   to understand the lay of the land?
            14             MR. GERBER:  There are two pages here.  There's
            15   actual recalculation of the data plus the publishing of the
            16   forms which we distribute.  The calculation portion of this
            17   is fairly straightforward and relatively automated and we
            18   have our settlements analyst applying the mitigated price
            19   to the manual entries of the OOM transactions and then
            20   offload those when they apply the price to the settlement
            21   calculation.  The settlement calculation, once that
            22   information is there with the prices, can be started with a
            23   batch job and just turn out the calculations.
            24             When we -- we have to stop that process to
            25   actually generate a statement, and that requires our
0549
             1   database people to actually have to babysit the process and
             2   let it run automated.  So every day, for every trade day we
             3   have a statement, somebody will have to be manually in
             4   front of the machine, watch the statement publication
             5   stop.
             6             The other thing that it does, it requires the
             7   same servers to do that.  So it was our intent to let the
             8   automated process run, if the data calculated and then
             9   rather than interrupt that production work, we need to do
            10   the statements later.  If the people want the statements
            11   sooner, we have to stop production to generate the
            12   statement and then restart the production.
            13             PRESIDING JUDGE:  If you were to interrupt the
            14   process on a periodic basis, and I am not sure what that
            15   periodic basis would be, I hope you could advise me, how
            16   much more time would that add to the eight to nine weeks
            17   Mr. Jordan has identified so that we could understand
            18   whether it makes sense to do that or just wait until
            19   November 30 and the additional week that it's estimated to
            20   take to provide a statement?
            21             I am asking this because some of this could
            22   impact the format of a revised trial schedule, and whether
            23   the parties can be doing several different things in order
            24   to facilitate their responsibilities under the Commission's
            25   July 25 order or we all have to sit back and wait until
0550
             1   November 30 or a week or so thereafter before the PX could
             2   begin its job or most of its job and people can understand
             3   whether they need to pursue discovery, et cetera.
             4             MR. GERBER:  I don't have that in my head, but
             5   let me try to frame it.  I think we mentioned earlier in
             6   this proceeding that we have actually -- we have four or
             7   five different servers that we are using simultaneously to
             8   produce this, produce the recalculation in the eight-week
             9   period.  I believe that what we do, because we have run
            10   things sequentially, quite often we will use one server to
            11   run one sequence of days, so we might have a server working
            12   on October, starting in October and pick a date, calculate
            13   how fast that server works and when that will -- finish
            14   that production run and start another server with a
            15   November 15 forward.
            16             It would be possible, because we are using
            17   multiple servers, we have to publish statements of the
            18   servers that we produce them in.  If we could stagger the
            19   work in a way that would allow us, once they have completed
            20   it, to produce these statements off of each server and
            21   deliver the statements, publish those statements, in some
            22   kind of progressive and intermittent fashion rather than
            23   waiting until the entire end.  But I don't have a good idea
            24   of what impact that would have on the overall --
            25             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Is there some way after
0551
             1   conferring with the Staff we could get a handle on that?
             2             MR. GERBER:  Certainly, I will ask our production
             3   people how we can do that, what that impact would be.
             4             MR. JORDAN:  It strikes me if there is a logical
             5   cut off or production, it might be the last pay date for
             6   the PX, so that we kind of divide the world into PX/post
             7   PX.  I don't know if that makes sense to others.
             8             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Well, I would appreciate it if
             9   the ISO can briefly confer and advise all of us whether
            10   it's possible to make, to provide periodic or staggered
            11   statements in addition to the cumulative statement and
            12   understand whether that would really help the process, in
            13   terms of the ISO's belief, or whether it doesn't add much,
            14   if anything, to the process other than consuming some
            15   additional time.  I would appreciate the ISO's view on that
            16   and of course, once we understand that, anybody else's
            17   perception.  Yes, sir.
            18             MR. STROTHER:  Your Honor, I just wanted to
            19   follow up on some of what you were saying.  Rather than a
            20   cumulative set of statements, I think maybe some spot runs
            21   might be useful.  From what I understand happened last
            22   time, we went into a process that should have resulted in
            23   lower rates to Vernon's purchases.  So what we noticed
            24   right away our number went up, it went up because of the
            25   neutrality charge.  The neutrality charge is just a
0552
             1   catchall.  That should have been a signal; it was to us
             2   when we figured it out that something else was going on in
             3   another account.
             4             It has turned out that that characterizes a
             5   computer error that an adjustment was applied to one side
             6   of count 407 and not the other.  But I am just wondering
             7   if, rather than having cumulative data for a particular
             8   time period, we could have spot checks of the methodology
             9   by doing a test run.  Enron has asked for a narrative
            10   statement of the methodology.  Would it be possible to take
            11   a few days and see if the numbers come out the way they
            12   should.
            13             I think that is different than running everything
            14   up to a certain point and dishing that out.  You might be
            15   able to do it quite early on.  There was a bust in the
            16   methodology last time that might have been easily caught
            17   with just a few spot checks.
            18             MR. JORDAN:  Your Honor, as a nonbilling and
            19   settlement person, I see a lot of validity in that, but we
            20   are lawyers talking.  I would even suggest that you run two
            21   days out of each month sort of so we see what is going on
            22   at different times, when you know, when CERS come in, when
            23   CERS wasn't there, that sort of thing, so when people see
            24   wackiness, we hopefully spot it before we have gone eight
            25   or nine weeks, but I have no idea whether that is something
0553
             1   that can be done.
             2             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Yes.  I raised the question.  I
             3   would like the technical staff of the ISO to advise whether
             4   the weekly progress report that we talked about or some
             5   other kind of report on a periodic basis could keep us
             6   abreast of whether you are having problems.
             7             The suggestion that was just raised I think would
             8   be appropriate also for you to advise us in relationship to
             9   my question of whether we could have periodic statements in
            10   addition to the cumulative statement at the end of
            11   November.  If there is some form of spot-checking that the
            12   ISO finds is feasible, and we can understand the amount and
            13   time that would take, whether we call it a progress report
            14   or something else, I think that would be useful to
            15   understand this morning.
            16             Do you see me, Mr. Gerber?
            17             MR. GERBER:  Yes, your Honor.
            18             We can cut this up and do it any way you want
            19   to.  We gave the estimate of the most efficient way to
            20   reproduce the calculation and that's where we came up with
            21   eight weeks to recalculate and the one week to publish, to
            22   make the data available to the parties.  If what I am
            23   hearing is a suggestion that we break that up, and the
            24   process will be to recalculate test days, publish those
            25   independently, that is going to impact the ability to
0554
             1   deliver this in the nine-week period.
             2             I don't know, without having to sit down with
             3   some of the people that are actually pushing the button,
             4   what impact that will have, but I know that when they
             5   evaluated how to do this, the evaluation was focused on the
             6   ability to produce the entire time frame in the shortest
             7   amount of time.
             8             PRESIDING JUDGE:  I would like to know that piece
             9   of information so that I can determine regardless of the
            10   participants' interests, whether it's appropriate to do
            11   that, to require to you do that.
            12             MR. GERBER:  Okay, hang on, we can do that, yes.
            13   What I am hearing is you want an estimate, what amount of
            14   time it would take to do two things:  One would be to break
            15   up the publishing and production of those statements in a
            16   shorter time frame, but to continue to do it in a batch.
            17   And I have also heard the suggestion we might pick a few
            18   representative days, given the different conditions that
            19   may have occurred, and I would need some kind of guidance
            20   on what particular days or what period or how many in each
            21   period to come back to you with an estimate of how long
            22   that would take.
            23             PRESIDING JUDGE:  I think it might be useful to
            24   understand from the ISO's perspective whether a sample of
            25   two days every month or some other kind of sample, what
0555
             1   might be representative.  I think you are in a better
             2   position to tell us that than lawyers speculating on what
             3   we should do.  Then, once we understand the ISO's opinion,
             4   I can understand whether people have concerns about that
             5   and we can explore with you the full parameters of it.
             6             MR. GERBER:  What I might suggest we pick two
             7   days in early October or latter part of October which we
             8   are hopefully clean with respect to what type of manual
             9   entries might have been so people can take a look at that.
            10   There are a couple of days, my recollection, in mid to late
            11   November that are -- have some interesting things happening
            12   that may increase the amount of manual entries, certainly a
            13   couple of days in the first part of December, within the
            14   first 12 days because that's when we had some significant
            15   difficulty, and then perhaps look for a couple of days
            16   towards February, March or May, when somebody suggested
            17   that the PX was no longer in existence, to take a look at
            18   how those days are going.
            19             PRESIDING JUDGE:  How soon could you do that?
            20             MR. GERBER:  How soon could we give you an answer
            21   on how long it would take to do that?
            22             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Right.
            23             (Laughter.)
            24             PRESIDING JUDGE:  That is, how long it would take
            25   to do that, and how long would you expect it would take for
0556
             1   us to have it, if that's a useful exercise.
             2             MR. GERBER:  I don't know, your Honor, I would
             3   have to -- I don't have it off the top of my head.  I would
             4   have to check with the people doing the production work to
             5   see how long that would be.
             6             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Is that something that you
             7   could accomplish within the next hour?
             8             MR. GERBER:  Yes.  I could step out and make a
             9   call.  I could do that.
            10             PRESIDING JUDGE:  If you or someone on your staff
            11   would be kind enough to pursue that inquiry and then let us
            12   know when you have the answer, I would appreciate it very
            13   much.
            14             MR. GERBER:  Okay.
            15             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Jordan.
            16             MR. JORDAN:  Spence, I wanted to add one thing to
            17   your list of trying to capture everything, the CERS's
            18   impact, with the PX going away that might be the same
            19   thing.
            20             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Does anyone else have a
            21   question with regard to the ISO of what we have been
            22   speaking about?  Mr. Allen.
            23             MR. ALLEN:  This is a general question.  I heard
            24   something, not that close to these details.  Perhaps what I
            25   heard is not going to create a problem.  I thought when
0557
             1   Mr. Gerber first spoke, he said there are so many
             2   adjustments, or he meant, he didn't use these words, there
             3   are so many adjustments, he would not be able to, I think
             4   he used the word "recreate," the ultimate product.  That
             5   is, this wasn't something that can automatically happen.
             6   The question that occurred to me is that is this proceeding
             7   going to be without a -- I use the euphemism "paper trail"
             8   so that counsel can ask questions about the results they
             9   have.
            10             MR. JORDAN:  I have to profess my ignorance.  I
            11   don't know what is created with each of these adjustments.
            12   Someone out there will have to say.  I don't know if it's
            13   work papers, if it's actually all done automatically, but
            14   it requires data entry, there's nothing put out, I just
            15   don't know.
            16             MR. ALLEN:  The only reason for my question, I
            17   thought I heard Mr. Gerber use the phrase "can't
            18   recreate."  I thought are we talking into a situation where
            19   lawyers will be confronted with, well, we told you in the
            20   beginning, we can't go behind the number because we can't
            21   recreate the process or speak to how it got to where it
            22   was.
            23             MR. JORDAN:  Right.  I think what he was
            24   referring to is we can't, while going through this run, we
            25   can't automate this process so that it can later be
0558
             1   recreated in an automated fashion.  I think he was just
             2   saying each time it is done it requires the same amount of
             3   human intervention and time, but I still don't know the
             4   answer to the question you are trying to get at.
             5             MR. ALLEN:  I hope it is a simple question.
             6   That's not the issue he is talking about.  I hope he will
             7   get the answer.
             8             PRESIDING JUDGE:  This is a simple utility to the
             9   spot-check process, if the parties had concerns, we could
            10   do that one of two ways.  There is an informal discovery
            11   process, I would hope that discovery process would keep the
            12   lines of communication open between the participants and
            13   the ISO and the PX, as we have been told has happened in
            14   the last month or so.  And so a conference call could be
            15   set up, or there could be a formal conference such as the
            16   one we are having now where the participants, under the
            17   guidance and the supervision of the Presiding Judge, may
            18   have an opportunity to raise questions, and then if I need
            19   to provide some guidance, I can do so in terms of the
            20   schedule that we are under.
            21             I am sure if there are problems, I will hear from
            22   you just as I have in the past.
            23             MR. ALLEN:  My only purpose in asking the
            24   question, and certainly this interim or spot-check phases
            25   will go to that.  There is going to be a zone in this
0559
             1   process where it can never go back such that it would
             2   interfere with someone finding out about a result or
             3   questioning about a result.  I am not sure spot-checking
             4   always addresses, it may well be that Mr. Gerber was saying
             5   something that shouldn't raise the question in my mind.
             6             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Anyone else?  Mr. Perlis.
             7             MR. PERLIS:  Your Honor, I am not sure if you are
             8   aware of it but the ISO released on Friday September 21 an
             9   explanatory document called a supplementary description of
            10   how they calculated the refunds for sales of ancillary
            11   services in the ISO energy markets.  That's basically a
            12   description of part of the process that Spence was
            13   describing relating to the billing and settlement process,
            14   but more particularly describing a manual adjustment they
            15   made, which is very different from any of the manual
            16   adjustments they have talked about previously.
            17             It's a manual adjustment that they made, as they
            18   confirmed in phone calls we had yesterday, the manual
            19   adjustment in whether or not certain transactions were
            20   subject to mitigation when they did their runs for
            21   determining refunds.  After they determined the mitigated
            22   market clearing price, the so-called issue 1 determination,
            23   in calculating the refunds they made an adjustment in their
            24   automated billing system and took out transactions that
            25   they decided were not subject to refund.
0560
             1             I would like someone, either Phil or Eric
             2   Hildebrandt, to confirm on the record that they made this
             3   manual adjustment to exclude identifiable transactions with
             4   CERS, CERS, from mitigation in the settlement reruns
             5   they've done.
             6             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Why is it necessary in this
             7   context to understand that?  How does that relate to the
             8   issues set for hearing vis-a-vis other issues the parties
             9   are raising with the Commission?
            10             MR. PERLIS:  I think this goes to the hearing as
            11   opposed to any other issues in front of the Commission,
            12   because it's as clear an indication as any that the
            13   determinations that are being made in this eight- or
            14   nine-week process are at best indicative refunds.
            15             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Well, I asked that question
            16   because I recall seeing a pleading cross my desk within the
            17   last two days requesting the Commission to review certain
            18   things that the ISO was doing.  I wonder if we are talking
            19   about the same thing and you are asking me to explore
            20   matters that you or other parties are asking simultaneously
            21   the Commission to become involved with.  I want to
            22   understand what I am tripping over and what I am walking
            23   on.
            24             MR. PERLIS:  I am not sure whether you are
            25   referring to a pleading that I or my client might have been
0561
             1   involved with, but the filings that have been made on
             2   behalf of filing recently with the Commission, are not
             3   directed towards determining the amount of refunds that are
             4   owed or the amount that is to be paid by CERS or other
             5   parties, the IOUs or the ISO to suppliers.  Our filings
             6   were made either to enforce a wholly separate set of orders
             7   from the Commission relating to creditworthiness or going
             8   forward matters in the way in which the Commission plan is
             9   working post refund period.  And so I think these are
            10   wholly separate issues.
            11             I am raising the point here and hope to get this
            12   clarification on the record, so that it's clearly
            13   established that all that the ISO is doing is providing an
            14   indicative set of refunds using their assertions as to what
            15   types of manual adjustments they think are appropriate to
            16   make in their automated settlements billing process, and
            17   that this proceeding may result in various changes, there
            18   will be discovery taken and there will be other issues that
            19   arise.  We didn't even think about this definitively until
            20   last Friday.
            21             I think that we can't stop every time we find
            22   something new that the ISO did that some people might
            23   challenge or some people will decide that the ISO might
            24   decide is a mistake.  I think it should be established from
            25   the beginning this is an indicative set of refunds based on
0562
             1   their assertions and they are going to have to explain it
             2   all in sworn statements and then we will have our
             3   evidentiary proceeding about it.  There's been a lot of
             4   discussion about manual adjustments heretofore.  This is a
             5   very, very large manual adjustment that hadn't been
             6   discussed previously; there are probably others that I
             7   haven't found out about yet and we will discuss as we go
             8   through this.  I think it's important that we understand
             9   what it is that the ISO is doing in this nine-week process.
            10             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Anybody have a disagreement
            11   with that before I understand whether the ISO should be
            12   required to respond to that?  Anybody disagree with that
            13   concern?
            14             MS. WATTS:  Your Honor, this is Jean Watts at
            15   Folsom.  Mr. Gerber has returned to the room and has the
            16   answer that you requested.
            17             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Why don't we take that up and
            18   see if Mr. Gerber is in a position to respond to
            19   Mr. Perlis's statement.  Perhaps you can advise him when he
            20   concludes his remarks what Mr. Perlis has said and what we
            21   can see his perception is on that.  Mr. Gerber.
            22             MR. GERBER:  Okay.  To break out a statement and
            23   stop production and produce them on a monthly basis, when a
            24   month is completed, would probably add a week to the
            25   process, because we have to shut down production, produce a
0563
             1   statement, takes probably up towards a half a day to do
             2   that and then restart the production work on the
             3   calculation.  So it would take upwards of five additional
             4   days to produce statements once the month is completed.
             5             PRESIDING JUDGE:  I would ask you to learn from
             6   one of your colleagues Mr. Perlis's concern and then see if
             7   you can respond to that.
             8             MR. GERBER:  Can I answer the second half of the
             9   first question, which was if we wanted to do several days
            10   on a spot basis, how long that would take?
            11             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Yes.
            12             MR. GERBER:  That would take -- the setup is the
            13   time-intensive part.  It would take a week to produce the
            14   first two days and then probably a day to produce each,
            15   produce and publish each subsequent day.  So if we pick,
            16   say, two days out of each month, it would take us upwards
            17   of three weeks to do that, but the setup being a week and
            18   two days for each additional date would be the -- what we
            19   are looking at in order to produce it on a piecemeal
            20   fashion.
            21             PRESIDING JUDGE:  It would take you three weeks
            22   in addition to the nine weeks we have been talking about.
            23   Is that what I should understand the spot checks --
            24             MR. GERBER:  If we were to do two days out of
            25   each of the nine months.
0564
             1             PRESIDING JUDGE:  In addition to that, if you
             2   were to provide statements on a monthly basis, we should
             3   also have to think about a further week being added to the
             4   processor, roughly a total of a month to do both things?
             5             MR. GERBER:  A month additional to do the entire
             6   production run, yes.
             7             PRESIDING JUDGE:  No, no.  My question was you
             8   said you might need three weeks to do spot-check of two
             9   days a month for the several-month period you were talking
            10   about; I asked you in addition to those three weeks, if it
            11   took you to do a week to publish a statement on a monthly
            12   basis, whether we are talking about adding to the nine
            13   weeks the ISO has stated, an additional month?  Is that a
            14   proper understanding?
            15             MR. GERBER:  Yes, it is, your Honor, thank you.
            16             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you.
            17             MR. ROBERTS:  Your Honor, Rick Roberts for
            18   Southern California Edison.  May I ask you one question on
            19   that?
            20             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Yes.
            21             MR. ROBERTS:  Mr. Gerber, how long would it take
            22   the ISO to complete if it's doing the statements on a
            23   monthly basis, the statements for October through January,
            24   which would be the period of time the PX needs in order to
            25   undertake its work?
0565
             1             MR. GERBER:  Just a moment.
             2             MR. PERLIS:  I think February as well, Rick.
             3             MR. ROBERTS:  Is that correct, Mr. Gentile?  My
             4   understanding was the ISO suspended trading on January 20.
             5             MR. GENTILE:  I thought there was additional
             6   trading that went on in February, but I could be mistaken.
             7             MR. GERBER:  To answer that last question, figure
             8   roughly half of those nine weeks because the PX period
             9   would represent about half of the total period.  If you
            10   added the additional time to publish monthly statements, we
            11   are probably looking at between five to six weeks.
            12             MR. ROBERTS:  So it would appear, your Honor,
            13   that it would not require an extension of the end date
            14   since the Power Exchange would still be able to begin its
            15   work at approximately the same time it would have if we
            16   didn't do the spot checks and the splitting of the monthly
            17   statements.
            18             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Perlis had a question of
            19   whether certain transactions were being excluded, and do
            20   you have that inquiry in mind and can you respond to that?
            21             MR. GERBER:  I was clear on his discussion of the
            22   impact of manual entries, but I wasn't clear about any
            23   specific transaction he is talking about excluding.  If you
            24   can help me with an understanding of what he suggested that
            25   we might be excluding, that would be useful.
0566
             1             MR. PERLIS:  Yes, this is Mark Perlis, Spence.
             2   The transactions are those referenced in the September 21
             3   supplemental description that the ISO issued and they
             4   relate to CEWR purchases beginning in September 2000 to
             5   February 2001 and CERS transactions beginning, I believe,
             6   January 17 or thereabouts and going forward throughout the
             7   rest of the refund period.  These were described yesterday
             8   by Eric Hildebrandt as transactions that were not
             9   mitigated, and that you had to make a hard coding or manual
            10   adjustment to your settlement process in order to exclude
            11   these transactions from mitigation and appearing in the
            12   iterative settlement rerun process; is that correct?
            13             MR. GERBER:  To understand your question better,
            14   I believe there are two components to what you are talking
            15   about.  There is a process by which we exclude CERS
            16   transactions and we believe that the Commission's directive
            17   from our recalculation does require a separate subroutine
            18   to take the quantities that are included in the production
            19   database as automated charges and making sure that
            20   mitigation does not apply to those.
            21             The second piece would be, as we go through the
            22   1.8 million manual entries, it's to also exclude those on
            23   the same basis to treat them the same.  So that would be
            24   the only piece that we are contemplating excluding, and I
            25   think earlier you were contemplating or discussing that
0567
             1   that we make -- we are not making arbitrary decisions about
             2   what we exclude in these manual entries in applying the
             3   mitigated price.
             4             The only exclusion that we would be anticipating
             5   making at this time would be to treat those transactions
             6   that the state entered into on behalf of the ISO, to
             7   facilitate the delivery of power to end-use customer from
             8   the recalculation both in manual entries and the generation
             9   calculation.
            10             MR. PERLIS:  Does that exclusion therefore affect
            11   the way the neutrality is adjusted and calculated amongst
            12   all the other market participants?
            13             MR. GERBER:  There will be some residual pieces
            14   that always come from any transaction in what you allocate,
            15   what you don't allocate, what you mitigate and what you
            16   don't mitigate.
            17             There is, however, as people have pointed out
            18   earlier in the proceeding, an anomaly, an apparent anomaly
            19   to the charges for the post December 12 period above the
            20   allocation of charges for above the MCP price.  That will
            21   continue to be present any time we exclude or eliminate any
            22   transaction from price mitigation.
            23             MR. PERLIS:  I don't understand what those
            24   anomalies are about, but I am not sure we have to
            25   investigate that in this proceeding this morning.  I think
0568
             1   you have provided the clarification that I was requesting,
             2   thank you.
             3             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Let's move on.  ISO has
             4   indicated it needs a certain amount of time to do certain
             5   things including time, if it's desirable, to do spot checks
             6   as well as to provide something, provide reports on a
             7   monthly basis, in addition to the cumulative report it
             8   suggested that it would make within nine weeks.  If the
             9   parties haven't had an opportunity in yesterday's
            10   conference call to focus on the possibility that we need to
            11   accommodate the trial schedule in these respects, I would
            12   like to understand whether it would be useful to explore
            13   this on the record or we could take about 30 or 40 minutes
            14   off the record to see if it's possible to focus on some
            15   adjustments to revise and conclude the data production
            16   process, including a provision for spot checks.  If there's
            17   a consensus on that, and a report at the end of each month,
            18   and how that would affect the evidentiary presentation,
            19   what changes in the trial schedule would be required at
            20   that.
            21             In previous efforts at this, it's worked to a
            22   certain point.  Then we spent almost as much time on the
            23   record after that.  I don't know where you were yesterday,
            24   so I raised the question if this is the appropriate time to
            25   understand what necessary revisions, if any, should be made
0569
             1   to ensure the data production process is completed once and
             2   for all and the evidentiary process is initiated and
             3   completed.  I think we should focus on that now.
             4             Then we could turn to any concerns Mr. Allen or
             5   others have with regard to what way, shape or form
             6   groupings might be appropriate and what reports and
             7   information the Judge is going to receive and some of the
             8   other items that I raised.
             9             MS. SCOTT:  Your Honor, as Mr. Roberts mentioned,
            10   it would seem to hinge on when the PX could complete its
            11   runs.  I think Mr. Gerber said five or six weeks to get the
            12   data it needs.  Does that still meet the schedule that we
            13   discussed yesterday?
            14             MR. GENTILE:  I think it's possible, but not
            15   true.  I think Mr. Roberts was under a misapprehension as
            16   to the rest of the data exchange between the ISO and the
            17   ISO but maybe we can use the break to discuss that.  My
            18   understanding I think when we discussed the schedule that
            19   we would be getting data from the ISO prior to November
            20   30.  Some of the data we get may not necessarily have to be
            21   in the refined form that everybody else will get it on
            22   November 30.
            23             If that's correct, and if we are utilizing data
            24   as the ISO makes it available to us, and if the ISO's
            25   delivery of data to us is held up by virtue of the need to
0570
             1   do spot checks and by virtue of the need to -- instead of
             2   completing its total data run and then publishing its
             3   results, doing it on a piecemeal basis, then that would
             4   affect our own ability to comply with the dates that I
             5   indicated to you earlier.
             6             So I don't think we can necessarily say that it's
             7   true that this approach could necessarily be done under the
             8   procedural schedule that's now been established, but I
             9   will --
            10             PRESIDING JUDGE:  You mean discussed doing among
            11   the participants.
            12             MR. GENTILE:  I'm sorry, your Honor.
            13             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Or many of them, but not the
            14   Presiding Judge.
            15             MR. GENTILE:  A major error on my part, your
            16   Honor, for which I ask forgiveness.
            17             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Repentance is appreciated.
            18             Does that mean that the parties might desire,
            19   say, 30 minutes to figure out where things stand in light
            20   of Mr. Gentile's statements so that we can come back in a
            21   more focused manner for 30 minutes and do it, or we can do
            22   it in a little less time than that?
            23             MR. GENTILE:  I would like to have the full 30
            24   minutes, Judge.
            25             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Okay.  Let's stand in recess
0571
             1   until 11:45.
             2             (Recess.)
             3             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Let's go back on the record.
             4             I would like to understand if we are in a
             5   position to discuss on the record any further revisions of
             6   the current trial schedule or if there's some other things
             7   we need to talk about before we get to that point, or do
             8   you want to stay off the record for just a little bit
             9   longer to see if some conclusion can be reached in the hope
            10   that it will save us more time on the record?
            11             MR. MC MANUS:  I think that would be helpful,
            12   your Honor --
            13             MR. GENTILE:  I think we have all the information
            14   we need.  We have a schedule that has ISO producing
            15   information on November 30 or a schedule that has them
            16   producing on December 30.  Those are the two situations if
            17   we are going to use the monthly stop/start approach or if
            18   we are going to use with the spot checks, which adds four
            19   weeks to their schedule beyond November 30; we know what
            20   the consequence of that are.  I am not sure.  It really
            21   comes down to whether we want to change the way the ISO
            22   produces the data.
            23             MR. JORDAN:  The only thing I would add to that
            24   is four weeks, assume both monthly and spot checks.  If you
            25   do it monthly, it adds one week.  Right before your Honor
0572
             1   came back in there had begun to be discussion, if we could
             2   do the monthly, do we need the spot checks.  People were
             3   saying -- well, some people were saying we want the
             4   monthly; somebody pointed out but spot-check will show you
             5   up front, if you have a problem, any particular month if
             6   different type of things happened than the early month.
             7             Right as you were walking in, the thought crossed
             8   my mind, I through it out, people in Folsom can probably
             9   speak to this.  I think it's quite possible that you would
            10   get to -- you would almost get the spot-check for all the
            11   different variations that are out there in the period as
            12   quickly by doing monthly as by doing the spot checks, am I
            13   not -- Spence, I think I see you there now.  If November --
            14   if October-November went fast, you get into the
            15   December-January period pretty quickly in doing monthly
            16   statements.
            17             It seems about probably no later than three to
            18   four weeks into the process, people would be seeing
            19   December-January statements, and you were saying earlier in
            20   you started off with spot checks, it would take three weeks
            21   to do the spot checks anyway to sum up, I think, monthly
            22   statements almost give you as quick a spot-check of all the
            23   variations as doing spot checks for all the months up
            24   front.  Is that understandable to anybody?
            25             MS. KRUPKA:  May I comment?
0573
             1             PRESIDING JUDGE:  I don't know whether it's right
             2   or not.
             3             MS. KRUPKA:  This is Catherine Krupka on behalf
             4   of Morgan Stanley Merrill Lynch.  Under your scenario, the
             5   only question I have is taking snapshots of different
             6   months, where the transactions may vary depending on who
             7   the parties were in the market.  Would your approach allow
             8   us to assess whether the process is working for, say,
             9   transactions that occurred in February, December or
            10   whatever.  I just throw that out there.
            11             MR. JORDAN:  What I think you would say as
            12   quickly or almost as quickly with monthly statements as an
            13   upfront spot-check.  I think if an upfront spot-check
            14   itself takes three weeks, I think within four weeks of
            15   producing monthly statements you will be getting monthly
            16   statements showing probably January.
            17             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Do you agree with that,
            18   Mr. Gerber?
            19             MR. GERBER:  I think that the issue would be as
            20   much as anything what we set up on, I think we are working
            21   with three servers this time.  As I tried to explain early
            22   this morning, is that we will start, do things sequentially
            23   but we try to produce a statement, start on one server and
            24   expect -- November to December on one server and perhaps do
            25   January, February, March on that one and start April on a

             1   third server.
             2             In that respect, if we were to stop production
             3   every time we cleared the end of the month on each server,
             4   we would be putting the information out perhaps
             5   nonsequentially, but you would get the effect of that
             6   sampling without having to add the additional time to
             7   spot-check a few days, it would keep us from having to
             8   include additional setup time to make that spot-check run.
             9             PRESIDING JUDGE:  So you would save about three
            10   weeks of what we were talking about, add one week to the
            11   nine weeks the ISO was talking about rather than a month?
            12             MR. GERBER:  I believe that would be true.  Yes,
            13   that's what I am suggesting.
            14             MS. SCOTT:  Does the PX still get its data when
            15   it needs it?
            16             MR. GERBER:  I think what we would do in this
            17   instance, as opposed to last time, what took some time in
            18   the last run was stopping and pulling off the PX data
            19   independent of the entire market data.  If we were to
            20   fashion this run, that we would just make all the data
            21   available to all the participants once we completed a
            22   month.  I don't know, because we wouldn't be optimizing the
            23   setups the first five months in this instance if we wanted
            24   to try to do this just in the most optimal fashion.
            25             It may take a little longer for the PX to get
0575
             1   their data, unless we do the configuration to make sure we
             2   get the first PX period done in the most efficient manner
             3   and flip over and get the additional amounts behind that.
             4   We do it either way.
             5             MR. GENTILE:  I get the funny feeling, your
             6   Honor, that what we may be doing is adding more time to
             7   what the PX anticipates it will take in order to perform
             8   its own calculations, because one of the issues that came
             9   up was, when we said that we needed a certain period of
            10   time beyond November 30, it was not predicated on the
            11   assumption that we would begin our work on November 30.
            12             We anticipated getting data much sooner than that
            13   from the ISO, and that is correct, they have been giving us
            14   data very regularly to process and we anticipated that
            15   would continue, so that if they changed their process and
            16   we don't get the data as quickly as we were, that could
            17   impact our ability to then -- but suppose they stuck with
            18   November 30 but were giving us data more slowly than they
            19   had been, I am not sure what that does to the January 7
            20   date.
            21             Lynn, are you still on the phone?
            22             MS. MILLER:  Yes, I am.
            23             MR. GENTILE:  If you have something to something
            24   to add to that, I wish you would.
            25             MS. MILLER:  We anticipated having some of the
0576
             1   data before the November date yet before January 30.  As
             2   they were working with the ISO they were bunching up
             3   information process and that I think is helping us keep our
             4   dates scheduled.
             5             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Tell me more precisely,
             6   Mr. Gerber, how would the flow of that change if we only
             7   did the monthly statements.  Would they still get the
             8   information they needed on a progressive basis, so that
             9   they could file their preliminary data by January 7, or is
            10   there something else happening in this process that we are
            11   not being told about if we simply required statements at
            12   the ends of each month?
            13             MR. GERBER:  We can do it either way, your
            14   Honor.  What I was suggesting from the overall schedule
            15   efficiency, if the PX were to wait until we have a month
            16   published and we provided that the entire market, it
            17   wouldn't slow us down a little bit for pulling out the PX
            18   data, stripping it off and sending it out individually.  I
            19   am not sure how much time.  Brad can probably speak better
            20   to how much time the issue of the publishing statements in
            21   providing the daily, once we produce a day, is stopping
            22   that out and stripping that out and adding it to the PX
            23   portion, without adding to the time frame.
            24             MR. GENTILE:  Do you have specific target dates
            25   by which you would produce data for each month?
0577
             1             MR. BOUILLON:  The answer to that question is
             2   no.  We will have an answer to that question in a week, but
             3   until we do it we can't trace the actual component.
             4             MR. GENTILE:  The Lynn I am referring to, by the
             5   way, your Honor, is Lynn Miller from the California Power
             6   Exchange who has a few more minutes left that she can be
             7   with us.
             8             Lynn, as I understand it, under this proposal, we
             9   will be getting data once a month for a month during the
            10   process.  I guess the question is whether or not, if we get
            11   the data on that basis rather than on the basis that we had
            12   been provided it, we could still complete our work, at
            13   least on a preliminary basis by January 7.  Assuming, I
            14   guess, that the ISO is still working with the November 30
            15   date now.
            16             MS. MILLER:  Yes, again, it hinges on when we get
            17   the data.  We will need a certain number of days to process
            18   a large month, in our case January through February, when
            19   we get the information and when we can begin the processing
            20   of those months in order to meet the schedule.
            21             MR. GENTILE:  Your Honor, hearing what I am
            22   hearing, if the desire is to say schedule today, if the ISO
            23   is going to continue to adhere to the November 30 date it
            24   had talked about but it changes the way it provides the
            25   data, I would suggest that to be conservative, we add a
0578
             1   week or two to the January 7 and January 22 dates to
             2   account for the fact that although the ISO will be -- will
             3   have completed its data production by November 30, which
             4   was the day we had talked about yesterday, the PX will be
             5   getting the data more slowly during the process.
             6             MR. GERBER:  Your Honor.
             7             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Yes.
             8             MR. GERBER:  This is Mr. Gerber.  We had a
             9   sidebar here in discussion with Brad.  I think if it's more
            10   efficient to continue to do -- send the PX the data as soon
            11   as we complete a day, I think we can do that without
            12   impacting our overall schedule and keep them on production
            13   task.
            14             PRESIDING JUDGE:  All right.  Let's assume that
            15   happens.
            16             MR. JORDAN:  Just to add one thing to what
            17   Mr. Gentile was saying, I think if we are talking about
            18   monthly statements for the other parties, the November 30
            19   date does slip with a ISO.  I mean, do add a week to that
            20   period, I don't think that affects the PX, but since
            21   Mr. Gentile was using November 30, I just want to be
            22   clear.
            23             MS. SCOTT:  But the PX is what is critical path
            24   for issues 2 and 3, in my understanding.
            25             MR. GENTILE:  Lynn, from what you have heard, if
0579
             1   the ISO completes its work on December 7, can we still meet
             2   a deadline of January 7?
             3             MS. MILLER:  We will certainly try to do that.  I
             4   would hope that we could have an offline conversation with
             5   the ISO.  It's very difficult for me to hear them, I think
             6   it's difficult for them to hear me at this point in time.
             7   If we could arrange this afternoon to do our standing 3:00
             8   call, we can try to figure out how to make that happen.
             9             MR. GENTILE:  Lynn, the problem is the schedule,
            10   the Judge may adopt the schedule before your 3:00 p.m.
            11   call.
            12             PRESIDING JUDGE:  It would be nice if we could
            13   conclude our business earlier rather than having to wait
            14   for a further discussion between the PX and the ISO.
            15             MS. MILLER:  Could we get Brad to call me right
            16   now in my office and we could try to talk and get back on
            17   the phone?
            18             PRESIDING JUDGE:  How much time do you need?
            19             MS. MILLER:  Probably less than a half-hour.
            20             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Brad, are you hearing that?
            21             MR. BOUILLON:  Yes, I heard.
            22             MS. MILLER:  Brad will call me.
            23             MR. BOUILLON:  Yes, I will call you.
            24             MS. MILLER:  I will hang up then so you can
            25   call.
0580
             1             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Okay.  So let's assume we have
             2   that piece of information in the next 30 to 40 minutes.
             3   Shall we stay in recess and then resume and see where we
             4   are or is there something we can talk about on the
             5   assumption that the PX will still be able to do what it
             6   suggested it might do and the ISO would require until the
             7   7th of December to provide the data?  Can we talk about a
             8   trial schedule with that in mind or do we need to take a
             9   little bit more time?
            10             MR. GENTILE:  Your Honor, if there are items
            11   other than the trial schedule that need to be addressed, I
            12   would suggest we take the next half-hour and devote that
            13   time to those other items, in that way we will go back to
            14   the schedule and adopt the schedule in half an hour.
            15             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Let me mention another thing.
            16   I have seen a draft, a proposed schedule from a phone
            17   conference, that may shift depending on what happens this
            18   morning.  That schedule had as the outermost date for the
            19   Judge's certification, March 8.
            20             I want to mention to you, I haven't had occasion
            21   to mention to you because I didn't think we would be
            22   dealing with the month of March, but if we get to March 23,
            23   then the Judge has a calendar conflict and certain
            24   unalterable plans that will make the Judge unavailable
            25   until at least April 5.  I can't change those plans.  They
0581
             1   were made a long time ago.  It seemed that this process
             2   could be concluded by then, but they were done even before
             3   this process came on the horizon.
             4             So if that -- if the trial schedule is going to
             5   move out much beyond March 8 and get us beyond March 23
             6   with me having to do certain things, that's going to become
             7   a mission impossible and we are going to have to expand
             8   some time.  I will be happy to explain that in a report to
             9   the Commission if it takes us beyond a 45-day evidentiary
            10   period.  But there's something else that may need to go
            11   into this calculus that I have had no occasion to comment
            12   on before.  I want you to understand that.
            13             MR. ALLEN:  Just for planning purposes, are we
            14   off the record?
            15             PRESIDING JUDGE:  We are on the record right
            16   now.  Do you want to go off the record?
            17             MR. ALLEN:  I just want to ask a question for
            18   planning purposes off the record.
            19             PRESIDING JUDGE:  All right.  Let's go off the
            20   record.
            21             (Discussion off the record.)
            22             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Let's go back on the record.
            23             If I understood you correctly based on
            24   conversations with the ISO, Ms. Miller, you feel that if
            25   the ISO continues to provide you data as it has been doing,
0582
             1   that you will be able to provide your preliminary data on
             2   the 7th or any adjusted date, and the final data on the
             3   27th or an adjusted date, if we needed an extra week to
             4   accommodate the ISO on a staggered monthly report basis; is
             5   that correct?
             6             MS. MILLER:  That is correct, your Honor.
             7             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you.  So is it
             8   appropriate to talk about a trial schedule proposal that
             9   can be adopted?
            10             MR. GENTILE:  Yes, your Honor.  Mr. Estes
            11   circulated a schedule yesterday which is not --
            12             MR. MC MANUS:  It's my understanding that Staff
            13   had a proposal but that the parties had all discussed yet,
            14   that maybe we should review and see how we can tweak it to
            15   accommodate the issues we discussed this morning.
            16             MS. SCOTT:  It's Mr. Estes's proposal with a
            17   header on top.  I gave the Judge a copy, so he has it.
            18             MR. MC MANUS:  You are on, John.
            19             MR. ESTES:  Whatever.
            20             MR. MC MANUS:  Your Honor, with the proposal of
            21   authorship, Mr. Estes or Staff, with whatever changes the
            22   California Power Exchange has recommended are acceptable,
            23   and I think in conjunction with the participants in the
            24   telephone conference yesterday.
            25             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Does the November 30 date -- if
0583
             1   I understand Mr. Jordan, there will have to be some other
             2   changes to the dates aside from the scoping conferences I
             3   was referencing off the record?
             4             MR. JORDAN:  Your Honor, from what I understand
             5   from what we heard this morning, that date does slide till
             6   December 7, yes, November 30 would become December 7.
             7             MR. ROBERTS:  Based upon the statement by the
             8   Power Exchange, I have, however, its dates would not
             9   change, I believe other parties can correct me if they
            10   disagree, no dates in the schedule aside from changing the
            11   ISO's date to December 7 and adding additional scoping
            12   conferences, I believe no other changes are needed.
            13             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Is that right, December 10 is
            14   date for rebuttal testimony whereas December 7 is ISO final
            15   data?  I just want to understand if that's correct.
            16             MR. ROBERTS:  It is, your Honor.  Under this
            17   schedule the rebuttal testimony would be on issue 1 and the
            18   data that the ISO is submitting would not be relevant to
            19   the issue 1.
            20             MR. ACKER:  May I suggest, since the record
            21   doesn't have the document we are talking about today, all
            22   we are doing is adding a lot of pages to the transcript,
            23   this discussion, as we work out the details, could be off
            24   the record.
            25             PRESIDING JUDGE:  I don't have a problem with
0584
             1   that.  If no one has any objection, we can go off the
             2   record, change the dates on here, understand what they are,
             3   build in my additional concern and then read the schedule
             4   into the record and see if what we have been talking about
             5   also addresses Mr. Allen's concerns or there is something
             6   else he wishes to speak about beyond the dates in the trial
             7   schedule and the process.
             8             Let's go off the record.

            11   2:00.
            12             (Whereupon, at 12:10 p.m., the hearing was
            13   recessed, to be reconvened at 2:00 p.m. this same day.)

             1                     AFTERNOON SESSION       (2:00 p.m.)
             2             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Let's go back on the record.
             3             Are we at the point where we can actually discuss
             4   something on the record?
             5             MR. ESTES:  Well, your Honor, I think the only
             6   outstanding issues with the schedule were whether and when
             7   to schedule these conferences we're discussing -- discovery
             8   conferences, and we have tentative dates for that and an
             9   understanding with Phil Jordan that they wouldn't
            10   substitute for depositions but would be geared more to try
            11   to streamline the responses to data requests.
            12             We were figuring the time frame should be roughly
            13   a week after the ISO gets testimony, each comes in.  I know
            14   we already have the conference on trial set for November
            15   13.  We seem to have a little time in that month so I would
            16   throw out something a few days later, 15th or 16th.  Does
            17   anybody have a calendar to tell me whether that's a weekday
            18   or not?  I apologize for not being prepared here.
            19             MR. WATKISS:  November, what was it, John?
            20             MR. ESTES:  15th or 16th.
            21             MR. GENTILE:  15th is Saturday, 16th is Sunday.
            22             MR. ESTES:  November 17 perhaps.
            23             MR. ROBERTS:  That's a Saturday.
            24             MR. WATKISS:  No, November 15 and 16.
            25             MR. ESTES:  Oh, let me strike all of that.  We
0586
             1   are talking October.  So we can go to October 16.
             2             MR. JORDAN:  Your Honor, I just want to, before
             3   we get too far down the road on that, so everybody
             4   understands what, at least from the ISO's standpoint, what
             5   we hope these conferences would do.  As I said, we have
             6   gotten quite a bit of discovery, written discovery, which I
             7   think is more in the nature of efforts to understand some
             8   of the data, as your Honor had said.  And I am hoping that
             9   these conferences would constitute for that kind of
            10   discovery, and also they would enable any depositions that
            11   are conducted to be much more focused and maybe of shorter
            12   duration than they might otherwise be.
            13             From the ISO's standpoint, these aren't
            14   necessarily additive to regular discovery, regular
            15   depositions.  If the only purpose of these is to have a
            16   third bite of the apple of discovery, then we wouldn't be
            17   so happy about doing them.  We didn't have a chance off the
            18   record to have any discussion about how to fit these three
            19   types of discovery efforts together.
            20             Are we on the record?  We could go off the record
            21   and have that discussion now.  But before we set in stone a
            22   schedule that includes these and just walk out and say we
            23   will also have depositions and we will also have regular
            24   discovery, I would like to have some off-the-record
            25   discussion about that.  Our purpose is to be as forthcoming
0587
             1   as possible, but also to be as efficient as possible.
             2             MR. GENTILE:  Your Honor, if I may for the Power
             3   Exchange, we look upon the conference as an alternative to
             4   regular discovery.  While we would entertain some discovery
             5   requests to the extent we could, our ability to comply with
             6   discovery requests I think would be very limited.  I am not
             7   sure why anyone would want to ask us any questions at all
             8   until our data was submitted.
             9             But as a general course, I hope that the
            10   discovery is exempted from what I have seen going back and
            11   forth between the parties.  Probably a lot of that
            12   discovery relates to the mitigated market clearing price
            13   which indicates that the Power Exchange is not involved in,
            14   there should be no reason for discovery by any party of the
            15   Power Exchange before January 7, and we would hope to use
            16   the conference following January 7 to clarify any issues
            17   that may be presented by our testimony and our data.
            18             MR. ESTES:  Well, I think perhaps we should go
            19   off the record or on the record and discuss whether the
            20   conferences are a good idea.
            21             MR. JORDAN:  Either way.  I thought it might be
            22   more useful to go off the record.
            23             PRESIDING JUDGE:  All right.  Let's go off the
            24   record.
            25             (Discussion off the record.)
0588
             1             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Let's go back on the record.
             2             We have spent much of the last half-hour on the
             3   question of whether section 202 C transactions can be
             4   addressed earlier in time than a trial schedule proposal
             5   that's been circulated by the parties in the subject of
             6   discussion today.  The ISO has suggested it might be in a
             7   position to identify fully those transactions, in which
             8   case the participants might be in a position to argue or
             9   stipulate with regard to that.
            10             If that's possible, I would like to know in terms
            11   of the ISO technical staff's point of view.  If it isn't, I
            12   think we should move on to something else, refine this
            13   trial schedule and conclude our business.
            14             I think we have about said almost as much as can
            15   be said about this issue in the abstract, so I would like
            16   to hear from ISO technical staff.  Hello.
            17             MR. GERBER:  Your Honor, ISO technical staff has
            18   just stepped out of the room.  I can have them back.
            19             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Why don't you go on a search
            20   and destroy mission and bring them back.
            21             MR. ALLEN:  Your Honor --
            22             MR. KAPLAN:  Your Honor, if I may suggest, an
            23   additional question you might ask them is whether that
            24   determination might also affect market clearing price.
            25             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Do you understand that, do you
0589
             1   hear that?
             2             MR. GERBER:  Yes, your Honor.
             3             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Can you see if you can retrieve
             4   your fellows and we can get back on line.  Thank you.
             5             MR. ALLEN:  Your Honor.
             6             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Allen.
             7             MR. ALLEN:  If you want to multi-task, I have a
             8   proposal which might dispose of the Burbank issue.  It's a
             9   very short one.  I couldn't find many people to meet with
            10   in the 15 minutes after lunch, but those I did led me to
            11   try this.  I went back to the Burbank motion and our
            12   concern was one sentence from your order.  It might be
            13   helpful for me to read that sentence.  This was the trigger
            14   for the Burbank motion.
            15             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Let me find my order here.
            16             MR. ALLEN:  It was the August 14 order.
            17             PRESIDING JUDGE:  I am back on September 6.
            18             MR. GERBER:  While you are doing that, your
            19   Honor, we apologize for the continuing request, but if the
            20   speaker could lean a little bit into the microphone, it's
            21   very helpful here.
            22             MR. ALLEN:  Can you hear me now?
            23             MR. GERBER:  Yes, much better, thank you.
            24             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Give me a moment, Mr. Allen.
            25             MR. ALLEN:  For the people in Folsom, I had
0590
             1   referred the Judge to his August 14 order which gave rise
             2   to the Burbank motion.
             3             PRESIDING JUDGE:  What is the troubling
             4   language?
             5             MR. ALLEN:  The troubling language appears on
             6   page 5, begins with a sentence which says "as noted, the
             7   trial schedule which I established is a hybrid proposal of
             8   these proposals and which is also required to establish a
             9   limited number of groups by presentations whose expert
            10   opinions will be subject to scrutiny through the crucible
            11   of cross-examination."
            12             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Marvelous language.
            13             MR. ALLEN:  It's something I just thought was
            14   terrific.  It caused us to come unglued.
            15             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Got your hinges back together.
            16             MR. ALLEN:  It looked like it.
            17             PRESIDING JUDGE:  I was planning -- from all the
            18   discussion we had, simply consider that vacated.
            19             MR. ALLEN:  I have a sentence or phrase.
            20             MS. RICHARDSON:  You already won, Don.
            21             MR. ALLEN:  Well, your Honor, instead of vacating
            22   it, certainly grouping is necessary for management, but our
            23   thought was that adding a sentence, I will read it
            24   quickly.  If it sounds like it's something that might be
            25   interesting, insert the sentence "the grouping of parties
0591
             1   is intended to help efficiently manage the hearing process
             2   and not to preclude individual submissions of evidence or
             3   individual cross-examination by parties regarding matters
             4   which are unique to them."
             5             PRESIDING JUDGE:  William Safire recently had a
             6   column on "unique" and how overused it is.
             7             MR. ALLEN:  I am under pressure, your Honor.  The
             8   other quick suggestion we would have is following the words
             9   "... and will support evidentiary presentations," that is
            10   the groups, insert "on matters common to more than one
            11   party," so that grouping would be targeted to matters
            12   affecting more than one party and the additional sentence
            13   would simply indicate that "grouping isn't meant to
            14   preclude individual submissions."  I can read that more
            15   slowly.
            16             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Well, if you take the former,
            17   you don't need the latter.  The latter is a redundancy.  If
            18   we were to agree that grouping is appropriate with regard
            19   to matters affecting more than one party.
            20             MR. ALLEN:  Well, your Honor, as the
            21   co-conspirator and not necessarily the author of the
            22   grouping motion, it would be helpful for us to have an
            23   assurance that the grouping is intended for one purpose but
            24   would not preclude the individual submissions of evidence
            25   on for individual cross-examination by parties regarding
0592
             1   matters which are unique to this.
             2             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Well, I don't think I was far
             3   from that in suggesting that that would be one of the
             4   purposes of the scoping conference, so early on we could
             5   understand whether it was feasible to group or not feasible
             6   to group.
             7             MR. ALLEN:  As Mr. Acker told me at the break,
             8   everything since then has envisioned grouping to help
             9   matters for efficiency.  I don't think we are far from it
            10   if you could just give us the assurance that you had wanted
            11   intended to pre-exclude evidentiary submissions, we are
            12   satisfied.  That needn't be in the form of a revised order.
            13             PRESIDING JUDGE:  My qualification would be that
            14   the individual submissions would have to comply with the
            15   45-day evidentiary process.
            16             MR. ALLEN:  Would that be without question, your
            17   Honor?
            18             PRESIDING JUDGE:  It would be without question,
            19   but it's a fact because that goes to the question of what
            20   we were talking about during the scoping conference of how
            21   much time would be required in terms of cross-examination
            22   and whether we could accommodate all of that or needed to
            23   rethink and see if something else could be done.
            24             MR. ALLEN:  Correct, your Honor, as we have
            25   developed an understanding through these innumerable
0593
             1   conferences on the phone and your prehearing conferences, I
             2   think we have come at a point in the schedule with two
             3   five-day hearings.  I think the way you are bifurcating the
             4   issues, that's going to get away from this.  I have added
             5   up the parties.  There's clearly only two minutes per party
             6   situation.  I was the timekeeper in the NUPS&H merger for
             7   all of the parties and I had to tell people you are
             8   finished cross-examining.  I know what it's like, it's a
             9   very ugly process.
            10             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Well, I would hope that the
            11   bifurcation facilities moving on with the issues, I am not
            12   as confident as you are, maybe because I am not generally
            13   as optimistic.  As a presiding judge, I take the worst case
            14   view rather than best case view.  Then my expectations are
            15   rarely exceeded.
            16             MR. ALLEN:  That's our modest proposal to resolve
            17   this Burbank motion.
            18             PRESIDING JUDGE:  I don't have a problem with
            19   that proposal or that understanding, and when I have the
            20   language before me, with the qualification I indicated of
            21   the purpose of the scoping conference to try and avoid to
            22   shootdowns in the middle of the street at the last moment,
            23   I have no problem modifying the previous order to
            24   accommodate individual presentations where appropriate, you
            25   know, particularly with regard to issues 2 and 3 where with
0594
             1   the more we have been talking, I understand that's
             2   likely -- that's the likely place for this.
             3             MR. GERBER:  Your Honor.
             4             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Yes, sir.
             5             MR. GERBER:  I have spoken to our settlements
             6   people and all of the 202 C transactions are included in
             7   the database.  They can certainly be flagged if necessary.
             8   I was unable to get ahold of Mr. Hildebrandt, who I think
             9   is in with the other FERC meeting going on at Folsom at
            10   this time.  I think he is talking with them.
            11             PRESIDING JUDGE:  I know people have alluded to
            12   another FERC meeting out there.  I am not sure what is
            13   happening, but I appreciate your advising me, so I am not
            14   sure where that leaves us in terms of when and how we
            15   approach 202 C transactions.
            16             MR. STICKMAN:  Your Honor, if I may, I think what
            17   it leaves us with is even though we have a list of
            18   transactions, there's going to be disputes over each of
            19   those transactions that relate to it.  I perceive putting
            20   forth a giant table, a spreadsheet of transactions and
            21   those that are covered or not covered by the DOE order will
            22   be so indicated.  The problem is that same spreadsheet will
            23   show up with regard to issues 2 and 3.  It's up to you, if
            24   you want to see the same problems rear their heads again in
            25   issues 2 and 3 you can.  But I think it would be more
0595
             1   efficient, just so you can get a visual of how, I believe
             2   probably all the parties believe that that is the way they
             3   will have to deal with each of their transactions and
             4   relate them to the 202 C order, to make a showing of
             5   whether or not they are covered and why.
             6             For us, we have to present individual testimony
             7   from the ISO's date which we have seen.  There have been a
             8   substantial number of transactions which we have left out
             9   and we have phone conversations, we have people prepared to
            10   present testimony on that issue if need be.  But what it
            11   boils down to is these are transactions which we are going
            12   to have to review, essentially, twice, I think.
            13             MR. JORDAN:  Your Honor, all of us are going to
            14   have to go through the excruciating process once, I
            15   believe.  The reason I think it's once is once you get the
            16   opposing views on the record, you have got the record made
            17   on that issue, and you make your decision on who is right
            18   and who is wrong.  Nothing is going to change what the
            19   settlement and billings run and show.  So the most you are
            20   going to be able to, I think --
            21             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Because the settlement and
            22   billings run will already reflect the ISO's view of what is
            23   202 C and what isn't?
            24             MR. JORDAN:  Yes.  Actually, I have just heard
            25   unless we do flag them, even the ISO's view of the world is
0596
             1   going to be included in the settlement and billings run.
             2   In other words, the transactions that the ISO would agree
             3   are 202 C transactions, therefore, not subject to
             4   mitigation, are in the database and so they will have to be
             5   flagged and not mitigated.
             6             MR. ESTES:  Or may be adjusted, right.
             7             MR. JORDAN:  I do want to speak on the record
             8   before we finish today.
             9             PRESIDING JUDGE:  We are on the record.
            10             MR. JORDAN:  Well, I don't want to divert myself
            11   to respond to Mr. Perlis and Mr. Estes's comments.  I want
            12   to try to deal with this particular issue.
            13             So it is a reality that there will be those kinds
            14   of spreadsheets and there will have to be testimony,
            15   probably will be very detailed, it will be excruciating.
            16   That's going to have to happen at some point.  Contrary to
            17   what Mr. Stickman has said, it doesn't have to happen
            18   twice, it just has to happen once, then, whatever you
            19   decide about when who is right and who is wrong, a certain
            20   number of transactions will be removed and the dollars
            21   associated with them will be visible from the settlement
            22   and billing runs and somebody can add them up.
            23             It is in the ISO's interest to have that back and
            24   forth earlier than the hearing on issues 2 and 3, because
            25   there's going to be a lot of other things involved in
0597
             1   issues 2 and 3.  Remember, that's where the rebuttal period
             2   is like one week.  I look around the room and I don't see
             3   another party that would be capable of doing any rebuttal
             4   on anything having to do with issues 2 and 3 other than the
             5   ISO.
             6             The ISO is going to get testimony and evidentiary
             7   submissions from approximately 75 parties.  We don't have a
             8   chance.  Even as it is, the reality is that with the
             9   constrained schedule, I am not sure what the rebuttal round
            10   on issues 2 and 3 is going to look like.
            11             But it doesn't seem necessary to make it
            12   impossible to join issue on 202 C by throwing it into that
            13   phase as well when it could be joined, seemed like it could
            14   be joined earlier.  So there's a real practical reason the
            15   ISO would like to have it done earlier.  I mean, it's the
            16   same as Staff but to the nth degree.
            17             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Well, if it could be done
            18   earlier and wouldn't interfere with or require further
            19   adjustment of ISO-corrected data, then I have no problem of
            20   moving the point where we focus, where this evidence is
            21   presented and where we focus on it, from where it is placed
            22   in the proposed circulated trial schedule.  I don't want to
            23   go through another round of corrected data unless it's
            24   required by the Commission.  You know, twice is enough.
            25             MR. STICKMAN:  That is our biggest concern.  That
0598
             1   is our biggest concern.
             2             MR. JORDAN:  I wanted to call you, Jon.
             3   Mr. Stickman, can you explain how it matters where the
             4   order is joined on this as to whether there is another
             5   round or not?
             6             MR. STICKMAN:  Well, I presume that should
             7   something occur where the dates change or there's some
             8   reference in the runs you are doing where you have
             9   understood that there's been an error and you have left out
            10   a day or something like that, a day that should or should
            11   not have been in a DOE order.  That changes the whole
            12   analyses.  We have to deal with it again.  That's our
            13   biggest concern, that if we nailed you down to the 500
            14   days, as you called it, and we can have sufficient time to
            15   respond to that, you know, and say, no, there were more
            16   days when you know your operators called in and the name of
            17   the DOE order asks for power, that would occur.
            18             I am concerned issue 2 or 3 comes around, we
            19   realize, hey, there are a couple of different days and I
            20   don't have an opportunity to present evidence on it.  If
            21   that's the case, then I am in a case where I can't
            22   represent my client adequately.  That's my problem.
            23             MR. JORDAN:  John, hold on one second.  I
            24   confirmed with the askers of the data request.  The ISO has
            25   responded to a data request with specific transactions that
0599
             1   it believes were subject to the 202 C order.  I did want to
             2   have Mr. Hildebrandt, before he made his statement, but I
             3   have no reason, absolutely none, sitting here to think
             4   that's not the universe per the ISO.
             5             That's why there is no reason to think that the
             6   universe can't be put in by the ISO either with the sworn
             7   statement or as part of the first round of testimony on
             8   issue 1.
             9             PRESIDING JUDGE:  If it could be done with a
            10   sworn statement and we needed it and parties felt
            11   differently about it, we could address that well before
            12   November 6 in trying to clear the way.  From what you have
            13   been saying, it's been part of the mitigated market
            14   clearing price data, going to be there, and if the ISO, as
            15   part of its October 9 presentation intends to highlight, in
            16   appendix fashion or some other fashion transactions, that
            17   it removed because it felt that they were within section
            18   202 C and therefore didn't have to be mitigated, we could
            19   take that on early in the form of an oral argument.
            20             As long as I had some position papers in advance,
            21   or a stipulation of what the issue is and a line up of who
            22   the participants are on one side, and potential
            23   participants on the other, take up the arguments full-blown
            24   on an oral conference.
            25             MR. STICKMAN:  If that is the only case, my
0600
             1   question is, if we want to put on a witness, it's my
             2   understanding that one of our representatives received
             3   calls on a daily basis from the ISO, whose representatives
             4   made the representations that these were DOE sales for
             5   several days that aren't covered, for example, by the
             6   order, would that be the time that we would present that
             7   evidence?  How would that work?  Logically, how would we
             8   deal by that?
             9             PRESIDING JUDGE:  If it's raised by the table and
            10   somebody contests the table, seems to me in the first place
            11   you could just do it by a trial stipulation or some kind of
            12   brief explanation and attach your supporting documentation
            13   and we can argue whether or not that is what was intended
            14   without a witness.  If what we are talking about is phone
            15   calls and/or some other documentary evidence.
            16             MR. STICKMAN:  Would we support it with an
            17   affidavit, then, or what would you -- I am just trying to
            18   logistically --
            19             PRESIDING JUDGE:  I am not your advocate.  It's
            20   not for me to tell your parties how to present the case.
            21   You can have an oral argument.  All I am suggesting, at
            22   some point before that oral argument I have a stipulation
            23   of what the arguments are, who is on one side and who is
            24   potentially on the other.
            25             The stipulated issue can frame the different
0601
             1   perspective, the different general perspectives on that
             2   issue.  And maybe I can be provided prior to the argument,
             3   if you want to call it argument or we can call it a
             4   prehearing conference, justification from any opposing
             5   party so that the ISO will be able to defend its position,
             6   assuming you haven't settled that beforehand.
             7             MR. STICKMAN:  It's my assumption that they
             8   probably -- we won't be able to settle it.  You are going
             9   to have to make a finding of fact on those issues, we are
            10   going to have to present factual evidence, your Honor,
            11   that's my concern.
            12             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Or we can call it an
            13   evidentiary ruling.
            14             MR. STICKMAN:  Or an evidentiary ruling if you
            15   want to call it that.
            16             MS. SCOTT:  Your Honor, may I suggest if the ISO
            17   is willing to provide its direct case on October 9 on this
            18   issue, Mr. Stickman's clients could present their
            19   responsive testimony on November 6, and I would assume that
            20   he will have witnesses who say that on January 8 at 3:00 in
            21   the morning, the ISO called me and here is the telephone
            22   transcript.  That's how I would assume this thing will
            23   shake out.
            24             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Stickman Exhibit 1 with three
            25   letters as required by the Chief Judge.
0602
             1             MR. STICKMAN:  STI.
             2             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Your client's name, not your
             3   personal name.
             4             MR. STICKMAN:  I know that, your Honor.
             5             MS. SCOTT:  It could go with issue 1.
             6             PRESIDING JUDGE:  That's where it was in the
             7   original trial schedule.  If you want to address it that
             8   way, then the question is if you want, we could take it up
             9   at the scoping conference.  As long as there was evidence,
            10   as long as there was a presentation on November 6 that
            11   presented a different view of the world so the ISO had an
            12   understanding of why somebody was troubled and felt it was
            13   wrong.
            14             MR. CARROLL:  Your Honor, this is Ron Carroll.
            15   As I indicated off the record.  I indicated I would have
            16   liked to stay on the record, it's obvious with Mr. Stickman
            17   this is a factual matter.  There has to be testimony on the
            18   record somewhere, I don't believe it's appropriate to be
            19   handled in some sort of pleadings or some sort of motion
            20   supported by affidavits unless those affidavits are
            21   formally admitted into the formal record in this
            22   proceeding, which should be an unwieldy solution to an
            23   already unwieldy proceeding.
            24             In my view, it clearly needs to be in one of the
            25   rounds of the testimony for the reasons that I thought we
0603
             1   had agreed to yesterday, it would have been in rounds 2 and
             2   3 for issues 2 and 3, but at a minimum it should be
             3   considered as part of issue 1.
             4             PRESIDING JUDGE:  As I just said, I think we are
             5   spending more time than we need to at this point.  If you
             6   want to address it shortly, part of the presentations on
             7   November 6 and that we have on November 13, in addition to
             8   a scoping conference and oral argument, with regard to the
             9   propriety of section 202 C claims, we can do that.
            10             If we need to carry over that oral argument on
            11   that particular subject after we have taken care of all our
            12   other business, we can carry it over to the next day or
            13   whenever the next business day is for that purpose,
            14   November 13 is a Tuesday, so if we hadn't concluded
            15   whatever was supposed to be done on the 13th, we can carry
            16   it over to the 14th and/or 15th while the rest of the
            17   schedule goes forward.
            18             MS. SCOTT:  Your Honor, I am quite willing to
            19   cross bridges when I get to them, but I think we should at
            20   least leave the possibility open, as Mr. Carroll was
            21   suggesting, that parties who felt the need could file
            22   simultaneous rebuttal testimony on December 10 and that it
            23   be considered during the hearing.  We may get to your
            24   scoping conference and everybody agrees we don't need to,
            25   but I wouldn't want to preclude that possibility at this
0604
             1   point.
             2             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Well, we have a scoping
             3   conference on the 13th of December as well, which is short
             4   of by at least a couple of days, 13th a Tuesday, to hear
             5   the proposed hearing on issue 1 isn't until on a Monday,
             6   that item, anything else, before we could deal with it on
             7   the first day of the hearing on issue 1.  Either way, let's
             8   come to some conclusion and get on with what this schedule
             9   is about.
            10             MS. SCOTT:  Staff would like to be able to file
            11   responsive testimony to the November 6 testimony, because
            12   we have seen the ISO's data responses, we haven't seen a
            13   case from some of the people we think will be raising 202 C
            14   issues and Staff would like the opportunity to file
            15   rebuttal testimony on December 10.
            16             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Do you want to put it up on the
            17   first round with regard to hearing 1 and take it out of the
            18   second round, and either address it on the first day of the
            19   hearing as the first piece of business before we get into
            20   cross-examination on other issues, so that November 6 would
            21   include simultaneous responsive testimony on issue 1, any
            22   additional other sources of cost recovery and section 202 C
            23   and justification with regard to section 202 C transactions
            24   as we had it in the previous schedule?
            25             Then there could be responsive testimony and on
0605
             1   the 17th, at the beginning of the hearing, we could take up
             2   argument with regard to the propriety of inclusion in the
             3   alleged section 202 C transactions rule and then get on to
             4   other things that deal with the rest of the evidence.
             5             MR. STICKMAN:  Your Honor, I am okay with that if
             6   this is where we are, but my only question is I don't know
             7   if part of the day is going to be sufficient on the 17th.
             8   I don't know if half the day is going to be sufficient.
             9             MR. ESTES:  Your Honor, if I may make a
            10   suggestion.  What if we examine the time needed to treat
            11   that issue and when it should be treated during the first
            12   hearing as part of the scoping conferences that we have
            13   here.  I actually would vote to put it at the end if I was
            14   going to put it anywhere.  If it had to slip somewhere, I
            15   would rather not divide up issue 1 in pieces, I would
            16   rather push some 202 C stuff to the second hearing.  We may
            17   not get there.  This is hypothetical, without knowing how
            18   much of a dispute we have at this point.  That -- where we
            19   take this up in the hearing.
            20             MR. FERGUS:  I would concur.  202 is a very
            21   important issue.  If it went on for a significant period of
            22   time to prevent issue 1 from being resolved, that's
            23   appropriate.
            24             PRESIDING JUDGE:  I don't care if we do it first
            25   day of the hearing or last day.  If we need one more day it
0606
             1   means somebody else is doing other things while some people
             2   are dealing with this.
             3             If you want to deal with it up front, it seems to
             4   me that's the place.  We have gone around a couple of
             5   different formulations and since Staff is insistent upon
             6   responsive testimony, we can modify November 6 to include
             7   202 C justification with regard to alleged 202 C
             8   transactions, and permit responsive testimony as to that on
             9   the, wherever it is.
            10             MR. FERGUS:  10th, your Honor.
            11             MS. SCOTT:  December 10.
            12             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Yes, the 10th, and take it up
            13   as part of the hearing when we reach it, with whoever I
            14   guess the first witness is that joins that issue were
            15   there, and maybe we can then have a panel to deal with that
            16   issue.  I would suggest panels, panels don't necessarily
            17   have to be groupings because everybody has the same issue.
            18   If we have one issue, maybe we can have a panel.  We are
            19   talking about a panel rather than four or five who are
            20   sitting there answering questions, we can have a group of
            21   panels, we can have witnesses on related subjects, whether
            22   it's as to discrete issues or as to issue 1, where it was
            23   felt there was more of an opportunity for redundant
            24   testimony.
            25             MR. STICKMAN:  I think the issue, your Honor,
0607
             1   would be conducive to a panel.  I am okay with that at the
             2   beginning or end as long as I have time to put on my case.
             3   That's all I ask.
             4             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Let's get back to what isn't in
             5   this schedule.  We were talking about a scoping conference
             6   on the 13th with regard to whatever is covered in the
             7   presentations on the 6th, which would now include section
             8   202 C transactions.
             9             Am I right that December 12 would be motions to
            10   strike being filed by 10:00 a.m. in the morning, so that
            11   they could be taken up on December 13, which would include
            12   an oral argument as well as the scoping conference, and so
            13   we could throw in the oral argument also on motions to
            14   strike?  And it was suggested that there be a scoping
            15   conference I think on January 30, or did people want to
            16   eliminate that and simply -- we were back and forth on
            17   whether we should have two scoping conferences, one on the
            18   30th and one on February 8, or one --
            19             MR. ACKER:  Can't have too many.
            20             MR. ESTES:  I think, your Honor, that is the
            21   point in time when we may see motions to strike, as
            22   Mr. Acker has set forth.  We don't have a date for arguing
            23   rebuttal testimony due, then we may have superfluous
            24   rebuttal that must be prepared.
            25             PRESIDING JUDGE:  If we are going to have motions
0608
             1   to strike that I need to address, it seems to me that the
             2   motions to strike should precede the scoping conference on
             3   the 25th, which would mean --
             4             MR. ESTES:  We might have motions to strike filed
             5   by 10:00 a.m. on the 30th and then the 1st.
             6             MS. SCOTT:  Yes, there is a 1st.
             7             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Oh, 31st is a Thursday.  Do you
             8   want to have motions to strike on the 30th and the scoping
             9   conference on the 31st?  The February 8 date and the
            10   December 13 date would include column or charts of the
            11   nature that I have mentioned and the question was whether
            12   we were going to have -- nobody wants a discovery
            13   conference other than as it arises.  So is there anything
            14   else that has to be added to this schedule other than the
            15   dates that we just talked about?
            16             MR. ESTES:  I don't think so, your Honor.
            17             MR. FERGUS:  So I am clear on that last group,
            18   you were speaking of a scoping conference on February 1,
            19   your Honor?
            20             PRESIDING JUDGE:  January 31, not February 1.
            21             MR. FERGUS:  That's what I misunderstood, your
            22   Honor.  So any motions to strike would be due on the 30th
            23   then; is that right?
            24             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Right.  At 10:00 a.m.
            25             MR. FERGUS:  Thank you, your Honor.
0609
             1             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Any additions or corrections to
             2   the proposed trial schedule?  And the ISO, that would
             3   include sworn statements or other tabulations of alleged
             4   202 C transactions?
             5             MR. JORDAN:  Yes.
             6             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Okay.  So if I adopt the
             7   proposed trial schedule we have been talking about, with
             8   these several additions, what else is there to discuss
             9   today?
            10             Anything else, or have we finally reached the end
            11   of our rope?  Ms. Scott.  You want more rope?
            12             MS. SCOTT:  Something like that.  For the next --
            13   I would ask Mr. Stankus, who has been shepherding us
            14   through this, how far in advance do you need to know for
            15   video conference?
            16             MR. STANKUS:  Two days.
            17             MS. SCOTT:  48 hours.
            18             MR. STANKUS:  Two working days.
            19             MS. SCOTT:  Thank you.  That's all, your Honor.
            20             PRESIDING JUDGE:  Let me see if I took care of
            21   everything on my little list.
            22             Just to be clear, everybody is in agreement with
            23   the proposed trial schedule which includes adjusting the
            24   dates for the data completion process, which we have spent
            25   a lot of time, and then from the final date, the date of
0610
             1   the PX's final data commencing the clock on the 45-day
             2   evidentiary process that we spent the better part of the
             3   afternoon session discussing, which would result, barring
             4   any other changes, with a hearing on issue 1 on December 17
             5   through 21st.  And a hearing on issue 1 and whatever else
             6   was related to the November 6 and December 10 testimony.
             7   And a hearing on issues 2 and 3 on February 11 to the 15th
             8   and the Presiding Judge's certification on March 8.  Those
             9   particular dates.
            10             Are we all on the same wavelength?  Okay.
            11             Thank you very much.  We will stand in recess.
            12             (Whereupon, at 3:40 p.m., the hearing was
            13   concluded.)
