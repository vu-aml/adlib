LETTER OF ASSISTANCE
Dear Sir,
I know this letter will come to you as a surprise since we have no previous =
contact,moreover the present world is full of dishonest and distrust.I got =
your contact through the International Trade and Commerce (I.T.C) and I =
believe that with your experience in business you can assist us invest a =
large sum of money which have in our possession
My name is Mrs. Joy Makawi,the wife of late Mr.Abdur Al Makawi and my son is =
Abdul Makawi.During the current war against farmers in Zimbabwe from the =
support of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned farms to =
his party members and followers,he ordered all white farmers to surrender all =
their farms to his party members and followers.
My husband is one of the best farmers in our country and because he did not =
support Mugabe's ideas,Mugabe's supporters invaded my husband's farm and =
burnt everything in the farm,killing my husband and workers and made away =
with a lot of items in my husband's farm.On the night before the incident,my =
husband handed over to me a certificate meant for a secret deposited trunk =
box,which was made in a security company in Madrid,Spain and he disclosed to =
me that the trunk box containsUS$12m (Twelve million Dollars).The money was =
paid to the farmers corporation under him by his overseas customers.
After the death of my husband,I and my son Usman left Africa and decided to =
travel over to Barcelona,Spain underrefugee status in search of a good friend =
of my husband who leaves in the city,we arrived here to discover that the man =
has relocated to somewhere else.It is for the reason that we are contacting =
you so you should kindly not feel embarrased receiving this letter from us.
We have contacted the security company to confirm the deposit and establish =
ownership,and was disappointed as it is against section 22 of the refugees =
act No.130 of 1998 of the human right law that asylum seekers are not allowed =
to operate any bank account or to own an enterprise.
We decided to solicit for your assistance in the withdrawal of the trunk box =
for investment purpose.We cannot do it all alone due to our present status =
and we are total ignorance in business and investment.
You will be given a negotiable percentage of the money at the end of the =
transaction before investment,15% of the total sum will be given to you for =
your assistance,while 5% will be for expenses during the transaction.If you =
are trustworthy and interested in this proposal,contact us immediately for =
more details.Please maintain absolute confidentiality to ensure success also =
include your personal phone/fax number when replying.We await your quick =
response.
Best regards,
MRS. JOY MAKAWI
