ATTN:President/CEO,
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL

Dear Partner,

My name is Mr Gerald Duke a member of Independent Committee of
Eminent
Persons (ICEP), Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the responsibility
of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss
indigenes, which have remainedÂ  dormant since World War II.

  It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the SwissÂ
Bankers
Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by
non-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of
World War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims.

  The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent
Persons (ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional
dormant accounts -54,000 in December, 1999.The published lists
contain
all types of dormant accounts, including interest-bearing savings
accounts, secur!  ities accounts, safe deposit boxes, custody
accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts.Numbered
accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that
were interest bearing when established.

The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of allÂ
claims
on accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE
who with a credit balance  and accumulated interest of 75,000,000 US dollar
was discovered by me.

The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era, leaving a
WILL
in the name of clement Adele whom for the past 9 years we have not
heard from him and no possible records for trace ofÂ  heirs.

The Claims Resolution TribunalÂ  has been mandated to report all
unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of
existing credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government
as
provided by the law for management of assets of deceased
beneficiaries
who died interstate (living no ! wills).Being a top executive at
ICEP,
I have all secret details and ne cessary contacts for claim of the
funds without any hitch.

The funds will be banked in the Europe, and we can share the funds
and use in investment of our choice. Due to the sensitive nature of
my
job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim the funds.

  All that is required is for you to provide me with your details for
processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents
for transfer of the funds to you.Kindly provide me with your full
name, address, and telephone/fax. to ensure that the fund is
transferred to a secure, numbered account in your name in the Europe,
of which you will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and
transferring to your country and other banks of choice in the world.

  My share will be 65 percent and your share is 30 percent of the
total
amount,the the remaing 5 percent will be for any expences that will occure 
in this transaction.
THERE IS NO RISK INVOLVED.You can find additional information
about unclaimed funds through the internet at the following
websites:www.swissbankclaims.comhttp://www.cnn.com/WO!
RLD/europe/9902/09/germany.holocaust/

www.livingheirs.com
www.wiesenthal.com

The Holocaust Claims ProcessingÂ  Office has put funds in Escrow
awaiting submission of valid claims forÂ  necessary disbursement.I
find
myself priviledged to have this information and this may be a great
opportunity for a life time of success without risks.If you are 
intereste,contact me through my so that we can seal our commitments.
Regards
Mr Gerald duke
