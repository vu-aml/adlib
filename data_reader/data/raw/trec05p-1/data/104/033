Yes, we want the name on the contract to be Atoms Energy Corporation.  Let me know if you want to make and changes to the numbers.  Thanks!

Debra,

All of the thresholds and Mac's on the contract look good.  However, please confirm in which name the contract will be executed as, please.  I think that the contract should be executed with Atmos Energy Corporation.  In which case all of the references to Customer in the contract will have to be changed (as they all currently refer to Greeley Gas Company, a div....).  The problem is that we do term deals with Atmos as well (most of them) and if it is a division of the contract should be with Atmos and not Greeley Gas, a div.

Thanks and sorry about the delay,

Veronica

 Please look at the attached redline from Greeley regarding the credit sections.  As you may recall a previous discussion regarding the exact name for the contract, the contract will be in the name of Atoms Energy Corp.  Please let me know asap.  Thanks
