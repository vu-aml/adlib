Great restaurants, shopping, historical attractions, and more. Take a Fan Fare trip from delta.com and explore a city you might not otherwise visit. Whether you're interested in immersing yourself in nature on the slopes, the arts, or history, Salt Lake City is the perfect destination this weekend. Here are a couple of ideas to get you started.

Ballet West
Ballet West ranks among the premier professional ballet companies in the United States. The company strives to bring new levels of excellence to ballet through innovative choreography, and to present balanced programs representing a broad range of ballet styles. This weekend you can experience two company premieres, Christopher Bruce's Ghost Dances and Hans van Manen's Black Cake. Concluding the program is George Balanchine's tribute to the great composer Igor Stravinsky, Stravinsky Violin Concerto. Located at Capitol Theatre, 50 West 200 South, Salt Lake City.

Temple Square
No trip to Salt Lake City is complete without a long visit to the square that forms the heart of Salt Lake City. You'll find the Family History Library, the Tabernacle, home of the world-famous Mormon Tabernacle Choir, as well as the Temple that gives the square its name. Free tours begin every 5 or 10 minutes at the 100-foot flagpole in the center of this 10-acre block.	   <http://www.delta.com/images/spacer.gif>
