We have the edits, but are we still doing the letter or the motion, or both?

FYI.  Suggested addressing it to Angelides, but they didn't want to
"dignify" his letter.  They decided that, ultimately, Loretta's in
charge, and addressed it to her.  Had a great talk with Sarah.  She's
following up on a few things.  You may want to touch base with her re:
hearings on DWR rev. req.  You ever received my (modest) edits to the
Karl Wood letter?

Best,
Jeff

PS Is that article you sent me re: bad contracts from today's papers?

Attached is a final version of the letter faxed today to Loretta Lynch.
Please call or write if you'd like a faxed copy with the signatures.
(And
lemme know your fax number.)  If this letter needs to be distributed to
some service list, I will assume an attorney-at-law will perform that
duty.
