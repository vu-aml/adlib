Subject: [Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Marcus Robinson OUT For Season

Robinson Done for Season

Entire story:   http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1022/1267465.html

Clipped from the ESPN.com article:

CHICAGO -- The Chicago Bears are off to a surprising 4-1 start, but their
latest victory may have come at a high price.

ESPN Radio 1000 in Chicago is reporting that Bears wide receiver Marcus
Robinson suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral
ligament in his left knee in Sunday's win over the Cincinnati Bengals and
will miss the rest of the season.

Robinson had to be carted off the field with six minutes left in the first
half after he injured the knee. The Bears did not disclose the severity of
the injury after the game.

The reported injury is a major blow for Robinson, who was coming off back
surgery after missing the final four games of the 2000 season with a bulging
disc.

Robinson ranked second on the team with 23 catches for 269 yards and two
touchdowns this season.

Rookie David Terrell, Chicago's first-round pick, and Dez White likely will
share the starting receiver's spot in Robinson's absence. Marty Booker is
the Bears' leading receiver with 30 receptions for 331 yards and three
touchdowns.

Robinson, 26, emerged as one of the top receivers in the NFL in 1999,
setting a Bears single-season record with 1,400 yards receiving and 84
receptions along with nine touchdowns. Robinson's yardage total was second
overall in the NFC.

In 11 games last season, Robinson had 55 catches for 738 yards and five
touchdowns.

The Bears have won four straight games for the first time since 1995 and
matched their best start since 1991 with Sunday's 24-0 blanking of
Cincinnati.


[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]


Clearly a tough break.   Rookie David Terrell looked like a guy ready to
elevate his game to the "next level" yesterday.   Now his rapid development
(and production) will be a necessity instead of a luxury.   More as we hear
it.

Thanks to Footballguy Paul Troy for the lead on this one.
