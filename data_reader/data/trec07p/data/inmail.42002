Greetings from Dubai,

This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe 
it is only a day that people meet and become great friends 
and business partners.  I am Mr. Arif Shaikh, currently Chief 
Credit & Risk Officer with a reputable bank here in U. A. E.  
I write you this proposal in good faith,believing that I can 
trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you.

I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition 
for you. On November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant
/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR MOHAMMAD
AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months,valued 
at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand 
Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer 
before I was moved to my present position recently. Upon 
maturity in 2003, as his account officer and as well the bank 
manger, it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I 
sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the 
letter was returned undelivered. 

After sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it was 
again returned and finally I discovered from his contract 
employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Mohammad Al 
Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam 
Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to 
his country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information 
to the Americans. On further investigation, I discovered 
that Mr. Al Nasser's family wife and two sons died during 
the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare 
any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, 
including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not 
leave any WILL.  This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been 
floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by my 
bank management since no one have heard from the owner since 
2003.  I wish to let you know that all the investigation I 
have made so far, my bank management is not aware of it, I am 
the only one that have the information.

With the recent change of government in my country and with 
their efforts to support the United Nations in checkmating 
terrorism aid in the U. A. E.  By end of this year, the 
government will pass a new financial control law which will 
give the government authority to interrogate account owners 
of above $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds,
making sure it is not for terrorism support.  If I do not 
move this money out of the country immediately, by end of 
the year the government will definitely confiscate the money, 
because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain 
the source of the money.  

I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help 
of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an 
assistance.  As the Account Officer to late Al Nasser,coupled 
with my present position and status in the bank as Chief 
Credit & Risk Officer , I have the power to influence the 
release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the 
next of kin to the account, with the correct information 
concerning the account, which I shall give you. All documents 
to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and 
there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be 
executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you 
from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and anything 
goes.

If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you 
wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both 
parties will be satisfied.  If you are interested, contact 
me as soon as you receive this message  so we can go over 
the details.  Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. 
Please, treat with utmost confidentiality.  I shall send 
you copy of the

deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when the deposit 
was made for your perusal. 
  
I wait your urgent response.  

 
Regards,

 
Mr. Arif Shaikh
