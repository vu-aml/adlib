Wade & Leslie --

Christi Nicolay is talking with NE-ISO to determine our payment exposure for EPMI, EES, and EEMC due today.  I would expect to have the amounts due by 12 noon.  We probably won't have everything signed until later this week or earlier next week on the long term Financial Assurance Policy - so the Escrow Account won't be ready until then.

NE-ISO person for contact about this money is Cheryl Arnold 413-535-4018.
