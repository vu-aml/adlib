  IF I HAD MY LIFE TO LIVE  OVER
   I would have invited friends over to
   dinner even if the carpet was
   stained and the sofa  faded.
   I would have eaten the popcorn in
   the "GOOD"  living room and
   worried much less about the dirt
   when someone  wanted to light a fire
   in the fireplace.

   I would have  taken the time to
   listen to my grandfather ramble
   about his  youth.

   I would never have insisted the car
   windows be  rolled up on a
   summer day because my hair had just
   been teased  and sprayed.

   I would have burned the pink candle
   sculpted like a rose before it
   melted in storage.

   I  would have sat on the lawn with my
   children and not worried
   about grass stains.

   I would have cried and laughed  less
   while watching television and
   more while watching  life.

   I would have gone to bed when I was
   sick instead  of pretending the
   earth would go into a holding
   pattern if I  weren't there for the
   day.

   I would never have bought  anything
   just because it was practical,
   wouldn't show soil or  was guaranteed
   to last a lifetime.

   Instead of wishing  away nine months
   of pregnancy, I'd have
   cherished every moment  realizing
   that the wonderment growing inside
   me was the only  chance in life to
   assist God in a miracle.

   When my  kids kissed me impetuously,
   I would never have said,
   "Later.  Now go get washed up for
   dinner."

   There would have  been more "I love
   you's"

   .....but mostly, given  another shot at life, I would seize every
   minute.....look at it and  really see it ... live it ... and never
give
   it back.

   In honor of women's history month and in memory of Erma Bombeck who
   lost her fight with cancer.

   Here is an angel sent to  watch over you

    ** (\*** /) *. *
    ** (\(_)/ ) *
    ** (_/ \_) . *

   Pass this on  to five women that you want watched over. If you
don't    know five women  to pass this on to, one will do just  fine

Thanks:   Norma
