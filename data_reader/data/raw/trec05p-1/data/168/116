Attached are the indices for the data room thus far for your review.  Steve Van Hooser at 37238, (cell 713 582 6413), (home 281 955 0346) will be coordinating further activities in respect of the data room (additional information, logistics).  We expect additional information from Sally Beck's operations group.  We are having copies made this weekend to cover 4 separate data rooms, which copies are to be returned Monday am.  Steve will be reviewing certain of the materials with Mark Taylor that are counterparty specific for inclusion in the data room.  It is our understanding that you may also want to preview everything on Monday.  As the boxes arrive on Monday, Steve will call you to determine a time to meet you for review.
