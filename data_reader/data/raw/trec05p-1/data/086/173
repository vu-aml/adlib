The last 4 US Presidents are caught in a tornado, and off they  spin to OZ. 
After threatening trials and tribulations, they finally  make it to the 
Emerald City and come before the Great Wizard.  
Jimmy Carter steps forward timidly: " I've come for some courage."  
"NO PROBLEM!" says the Wizard, "WHO IS NEXT?" 
Ronald Reagan  steps forward, "Well.., I... think I need a brain." 
"DONE" says the  Wizard. "WHO COMES NEXT BEFORE THE GREAT AND POWERFUL OZ?" 
Up steps  George Bush sadly, 'I'm told by the American people that I need a  
heart." 
"I'VE HEARD ITS TRUE," says the Wizard. "CONSIDER IT  DONE." 
Then there is a great silence in the hall. Bill Clinton is  just standing 
there, looking around, but doesn't say a word.  
Irritated, the Wizard finally asks, "WHAT DO YOU WANT?" 
"Is  Dorothy here?
