                        Natural Harmony Foods, Inc. is an innovative new company 
                        that has developed and marketed unique, healthy natural 
                        protein foods, addressing a growing market need.&nbsp; The 
                        first products developed by the Company address the 
                        ground meat consumption habits of millions of consumers 
                        who have some level of concern about the possible 
                        negative health consequences of meat consumption.&nbsp; Under 
                        the SoyLean</span><sup><span style="font-family: Arial">®</span></sup><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> 
                        brand, the Company combines lean natural meat with 
                        fat-free and heart healthy soy protein.&nbsp; The resulting 
                        products offer the nutritional benefits of “veggie 
                        burgers” but with the taste and texture of real meat.&nbsp; 
                        These are the first meat products to carry the soy 
                        cardiovascular claim:&nbsp; “25 grams of soy protein a day as 
                        part of a diet low in fat and cholesterol may reduce the 
                        risk of heart disease.”</span></p>

                        Markets.&nbsp; After successfully marketing the products for 
                        over 10 months, the Company made a strategic decision to 
                        withdraw from the market, and to reenter later as a 
                        broader line of frozen products with the same great

                        There is an obesity trend that has reached epidemic

                        </span>There are more than 100 million Americans with

                        market for Natural Harmony. Consumers with high 
                        cholesterol tend to watch their dietary intake to avoid 
                        cholesterol, and baby boomers do not like the fact that 
                        they are aging.&nbsp; The recent heart problem experienced by 
                        President Clinton has been a further wake-up call for

                        prime target market, a market that generated retail

        <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Natural Harmony’s 
        competitors produce either all-meat based or all vegetarian based 
        products.&nbsp; The Company believes this has created a gap in the market for 
        consumers who enjoy the taste and texture of real meat, but want lower 
        fat and are aware of the healthful benefits of soy.&nbsp; Natural Harmony 
        products represent a whole new category of products with this blending.&nbsp; 
        Consumer research and Natural Harmony’s experience confirm that 
        consumers want healthier versions of familiar foods, which require 
        little or no taste sacrifice.&nbsp; The Company’s strategy is to: a) Focus on 
        major trends: Interest in healthier versions of familiar foods, which 
        require little or no taste sacrifice, b) Create a new category: A hybrid 
        of meat and soy, which has the taste and texture of the meat with the 
        health attributes of soy protein, c) Create memorable brand names and 
        become the leaders of this new category of foods, d) Preempt competitive

                    involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may
                    cause a company's actual results in the future periods to
