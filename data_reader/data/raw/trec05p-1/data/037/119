I'm ok, but minimize the discussion of the ECs deal.  Also or contracts, refer to transactional reports.  MK

Looks good to me.  Lets not say anymore about ECS than what Donna has in the last bullet.  Thanks. df

Gina -regarding TW's Gallup Project:  
 In-service dates were: Bloomfield -4/6/2000; LaPlata "A" -4/20/2000; and Gallup -5/1/2000 (Sempra protest delayed the issuance of certificate until 1/13/2000).  
10,000 HP was added at the Gallup Compressor Station; coolers and not compression were constructed at Bloomfield and LaPlata which reduced the temperature of the gas flowing in the San Juan Lateral.  This reduction in temperature caused the lateral and associated down field compressors to operate more efficiently creating an incremental 50,000 Mcf per day of firm capacity on the  Blanco to Thoreau segment of the San Juan Lateral.  The project enabled Transwestern to maintain its mainline operating pressure from Thoreau west to California at 950 psig at all times thereby accommodating shifts in market demand to the east without restricting delivery capacity to California.  As a result, TW is able to once again operate its mainline west of Thoreau at its certificated capacity of 1,090,000.
Total final costs filed with FERC were $13 million.  As stated in the original application, the project was funded with internally generated funds.
Please talk to Drew regarding the rates.
The shipper data is correct.   All the contract terms are for five years with the exception of El Paso Energy at 5 1/2 years and North Star Steel which expires on March 31, 2008.
As the Commission observed in the January 13 Order, ECS is not a jurisdictional company; whereas the motor that they would own is a jurisdictional facility.  Transwestern was therefore instructed to restructure its relationship with ECS so that Transwestern would have sufficient control over the motor to assume regulatory responsibility for the motor's operation.  Transwestern and ECS signed an Operational Control Agreement obligating Transwestern to assume operational control over the motor with respect to all facilities and activities subject to the Commission's jurisdiction.  DREW -ARE YOU OKAY WITH THIS?

	Gina - Northern never built facilities under the East Leg 2000 Open Season.  Donna Martens should be able to answer the Gallup questions.  Thanks MW

Michele, 

Can you provide the information requested below on NNG? 

Lorraine, 

Can you provide the TW information?

Please let me know if you need assistance.

Thanks, Gina

Gina,

Below are Katharine Fraser's questions.  She eventually agreed to reveal them to me! :)  I told her we would get back to her as soon as possible.  However, I just received her e-mail.

Thanks!
Sarah

Sarah,

As we discussed, Inside FERC has lost track of current information on a couple
of Enron projects for our online Pipeline Tracker service. As you can see below,
the questions are quite basic.

One, Northern Natural East Leg 2000 was scheduled to go into service in Nov.
'99, but at some point had a delay. I'd like to know if and when it went into
service; if it was built under blanket authority or was it certificated*; if it
indeed runs 264 miles from Iowa to Illinois and if so, what is the diameter; how
much did it cost, $300 million?; if it has a postage stamp rate, and if so, what
is it?; who are the shippers?; and with whom does it compete?

* If that's the case, please provide the docket number.

For the other, Transwestern Gallup, I'd like to know if it went into service
Feb. 1, 2000, as planned; how much compression was added at the Bloomfield and
LaPlata "A" stations (or anywhere else for this project); if it added 140,000
Mcf/day, bringing the mainline to 1.09 Bcf/day; if it cost $11.6 million as
projected and if internal funds were used; and what are the rates, which FERC
ordered the company to disclose. We had the shippers listed as follows: Duke
Energy Trading and Marketing LLC, 40,000 Mcf/day; El Paso Energy Marketing Co.,
40,000 Mcf/day; Southern Energy Inc., 25,000 Mcf/day; Sempra Energy Trading
21,500 Mcf/day; Reliant Energy Services Inc., 10,000 Mcf/day and North Star
Steel Co., 3,500 Mcf/day. Is that data still correct and what is the duration of
the deals? Five years? Also, in approving the project, FERC ordered Transwester
to restructure its relationship with Enron Compression Services Co., which was
to be the owner of the project; how was that structured?
