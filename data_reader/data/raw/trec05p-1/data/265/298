DONATION FOR THE LORD
From: Mrs. Praise Uwaoma

PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.I am the above name
person from Sierra-Leone. I am married to Dr Theophilus Uwaoma who work=
ed
with Sierra Leonian Embassy in South Africa for nine years before he di=
ed
in the year 2001. We were married for eleven years without a child. He =
died
after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death =
we
were both born again Christians and we lived happilly. Since his death,=

I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home wh=
ich
the Bible is really against.

When my late husband was alive he secured $15Million (Fifteen Million U=
S.
Dollars) with financial institution here in Cote D'Ivoire. Presently, t=
his
money is still with the financial institution. Recently, my Doctor told=

me that from all the test conducted on my health, I am not going to las=
t
long, expecially, due to my cancer and stroke. But what disturbs
me most now is stroke.

Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to churches or=

Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to=

instruct. I want a church or individual that will use this money to fun=
d
churches, Orphanages and Widows. Also, the propagation of the work of G=
od,
building and maintaining the house of God through this money, is very i=
mportant.

The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I=

took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit thi=
s
money and my husband relatives are not Christians. I don?t want my husb=
and's
hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers, for their own selfish i=
nterest and in an ungodly manner. I am not afraid of death hence I know=
 where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lo=
rd. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall h=
old my peace.

I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my h=
ealth, and because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me =
sometimes. I don't want them to know about this development, but I know=
 that With God all things are possible.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Fin=
ancial institution in Ivory coast. I will also give you all information=
 regarding the deposit of this money. I will also issue you a letter of=
 authority that will empower you as the original- beneficiary of this f=
und. I want you and your church to always pray for me because God work =
in misterious ways. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Chr=
istian. Who ever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit =
and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life.

Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or c=
hristian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you wi=
ll act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you soon.

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.=20

Yours in Christ,
Mrs Praise Uwaoma
