Ladies and Gentlemen:

In complying with the Organization Standards Process Manual, we are now presenting Appendix 3A3, "Electronic Tagging Service Performance Requirements and Failure Procedures," for your review before balloting. (Step 8 of the Standards Development Process - 1st ballot on the approval of this Appendix.) 

Appendix A3A describes the performance requirements of an E-Tag System Component failure. The Appendix will provide entities with guidance and requirements that they can provide to vendors and incorporate into vendor contracts for software and systems related to interchange Transaction tagging. The draft standard (Appendix 3A3), all comments received and the responses to those comments are attached. The same information is available from the NERC website at http://www.nerc.com/~oc/standards/.

All members of the Standards Committee are eligible to vote on the approval of this standard. 

Draft Standards can be viewed or downloaded from the following NERC web site:

Thank you.

Barbara S. Bogenrief
Secretary-Operations
