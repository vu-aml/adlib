<body bgcolor=3D=22=23ffffff=22> <=21--Al-Sadr's reappearance in the fourth month of=
 the U.S.-Iraqi security crackdown on Baghdad and environs was expected to complicate the=
 mission to crack down on violence and broker political compromise in the country.

Hours after the cleric spoke in at a key Shiite shrine in Kufa, about 100 miles south of Baghd=
ad, the notorious leader of al-Sadr's Mahdi Army militia in the city of Basra was killed in a=
 shootout as British and Iraq troops tried to arrest him, police and the British military sa=
id, further inflaming tensions in the Shiite areas of southern Iraq.

The U.S. military also announced the deaths of eight U.S. soldiers and one Marine, putting=
 May on pace to be one of the deadliest months for U.S. forces here in years.

Al-Sadr went underground =E2=80=94 reportedly in Iran =E2=80=94 at the start of the U.S.-=
led security crackdown on Baghdad 14 weeks ago. He also had ordered his militia off the stre=
ets to prevent conflict with U.S. forces.

His return to the Shiite holy city of Najaf appeared to be an effort by the 33-year-old fireb=
rand cleric to regain control over his militia, which had begun fragmenting, and to take ad=
vantage of the illness of a Shiite rival. There also had been some indication that his absen=
ce from the national arena was costing him political support.

Al-Sadr drove in a long motorcade from Najaf to its sister city of Kufa to deliver an anti-Am=
erican sermon to 6,000 chanting supporters at the main mosque.--=21><a href=3D=22http:=
