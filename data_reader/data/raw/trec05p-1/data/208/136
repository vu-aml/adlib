This issue of The Palm Voice speaks volumes for some of

TIPS & TRICKS

 Only so many hours in a day: The Date Book's 
 Preferences command adjusts the number of visible hours 
 in a day. You may prefer to view only the hours from 
 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., for example. If you'd rather only 
 see your appointments on the screen (with no blank 
 time slots), specify the same hour as the start and
 end time for the day.
