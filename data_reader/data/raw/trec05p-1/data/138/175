Latest price: 78 cents


Check out this awesome device at http://www.pc-ephone.com 
Comparing the 16,197,039 common shares of PC EPHONE 
outstanding as of October 31, 2001 with the market 
capitalization of a company such as PALM, this is a stock 
that really could be about to fly.

With news of carrier approval expected soon, there could be 
a huge win here. PCPH was over $6 earlier this year and 
that was well before all the recent exciting events.

representation concerning source reliability, readers must 
contact information suppliers on their own and gauge to the 
reader's satisfaction the truthfulness of any source 
information. It should be understood that there is no 
guarantee past performance will be indicative of future 
results. Any reference to past performance(s) of companies 
previously advertised are specially selected to be 
referenced based on the favorable performance of these 
companies and the companies referenced may not be 
representative of all past advertised companies as not all 
past advertised companies may have performed as well. 
Readers are cautioned that small and micro-cap stocks are 
high-risk investments and that they may lose all or a 
portion of their investment if they make a purchase in our 
advertised stocks. In order to be in full compliance with 
the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, Section 17(b), we have 
received 40,000 free trading shares of PC EPhone, Inc. from 
a third party as compensation for the distribution of this 
and other advertisements. Since we have received 
compensation and hold stock in the advertised company there 
is an inherent conflict of interest in our statements and 
opinions and such statements and opinions cannot be 
considered independent. We will benefit from any increase 
in share price of the advertised company. We will sell our 
shares at any time, without notice, be that before, during 
or immediately after the release of this advertisement. The 
liquidation of our stock may have a negative impact on the 
securities of the company liquidated, including decreased 
market value and/or dilution of the company's securities. 
Furthermore, our associates and/or employees and/or 
principals may have stock positions in advertised companies 
purchased in the open market or in private transactions. 
These positions may be liquidated, without prior 
notification, even after we have made positive comments 
regarding the advertised company. It should be understood 
that any price targets and/or projections mentioned are 
solely opinions and should not be taken as suggested 
holding periods. In fact, we will sell our positions in any 
companies advertised before they reach such target prices. 
The receipt of this information constitutes your acceptance 
of these terms and conditions. Reading this advertisement 
shall not create under any circumstances an offer to buy or 
sell stock in any company advertised. Nor shall it create 
any principal-agent relationship between the reader and us. 
The stocks of advertised companies may trade in fast 
moving, highly volatile markets, and any reader should 
observe the trading behavior of any advertised company 
prior to investing. Advertised stocks are often thinly 
traded and large sell orders will have a substantially 
negative impact on share price. Investors in advertised 
stocks may experience difficulty in selling shares without 
seeing a decline in market price and may have difficulty in 
finding ready buyers of their stock. Information within 
this advertisement contains "forward looking" statements 
within the meaning of Section 27(a) of the U.S. Securities 
Act of 1933 and Section 21(e) of the U.S. Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934. Any statements that express or 
involve discussions with respect to predictions, 
expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, 
goals, assumptions or future events or performance are not 
statements of historical facts and may be forward looking 
statements. Forward looking statements are based on 
expectations, estimates and projections at the time the 
statements are made that involve a number of risks and 
uncertainties which could cause actual results or events to 
differ materially from those presently anticipated. Forward 
looking statements may be identified through the use of 
words such as expects, will, anticipates, estimates, 
believes, or by statements indicating certain actions may, 
could or might occur. We encourage our readers to invest 
carefully and read the investor information available at 
the web sites of the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) at http://www.sec.gov and the National 
Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) at 
http://www.nasd.com. We also strongly recommend that you 
read the SEC advisory to investors concerning Internet 
Stock Fraud, which can be found at 
http://www.sec.gov/consumer/cyberfr.htm. The NASD has 
published information on how to invest carefully at its web 
site. Readers can review all public filings by companies at 
the SEC s EDGAR page. All information within this 
advertisement is qualified in its entirety by the detailed 
information and financial statements of the advertised 
company contained in its regulatory filings with the SEC.
