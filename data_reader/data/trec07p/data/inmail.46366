Thanks for your thoughts MG.  Again, more recent references would be
wonderful, but going on what you've provided thus far...

I understand that happens, (too often for my personal liking) but does
not the fact that a document "endorsed" by a UN agency (regardless of
the sponsorship of any individual or group of nations), regarding a
related conference, make said document - in it's final form - an
"official" UN document?

Perhaps it was sponsored by Austria, but if it is a UN document why
then should MS have _any_ control over the contents of the document?

There are many areas in which I could use schooling - politics first
among them.  =)

Thanks again.
