FROM GRACE ROSSMAN
85 MONUMENT ROAD
NIGER DELTA,


Dear Friend,


With due respect, trust and humility, I write you this
proposal, which 
I believe, would be of great interest to you. I found your
contact while 
I was doing a private research on the Internet for a
reliable and capable 
foreign partner that will assist me and my family.

I am MRS.GRACE ROSSMAN the wife of MR.KENNETH ROSSMAN
(late) of 
Zimbabwe. During the current war against farmers in
Zimbabwe and from the support 
of our President (Robert Mugabe) to claim all the white
owned farms in our 
country, all the white farmers were ordered to surrender
their farms to 
his party members and his followers. My husband who was one
of the best 
farmers in our country and treasury of the farmer?s
co-operation did not 
support his idea and so the party members invaded my
husband?s farms and burnt 
everything in the farm, killed my husband and made away
with a lot of 
items in my husband?s farm.Before the death of my
husband,he had depositedUS$9.5m
(Nine million, Five Hundred Thousand  US Dollars) 
with a security company in Niger Delta  as a valuable item.
Hence I 
decided to  contact you to assist me to move this 
money abroad.

So if you consider this proposal, we have agreed to give
you 20% of the 
total sum for helping us to move this money out of Niger
Delta  and 5% 
will be mapped out for expenses both of us may incur during
this transaction 
and 75% will be for me and my family to invest in your
country. All I want 
is for you to furnish me with your  details and your
personal phone and fax 
numbers and your email address for easy communication . You

can contact my son VINCENT ROSSMAN (Mr.) on his 
e-mail address for more
information.(vin.rossman@operamail.com)
 NOTE: that this transaction is 100% risk free and 
absolutely 
confidential.

Thanks and God bless you.

Best Regard

GRACE  ROSSMAN (MRS)
(For The Family)
