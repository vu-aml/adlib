NLRB RULES 2-1 STORE ILLEGALLY URGED OWNER TO ASK PICKETERS
TO MOVE

A Missouri health food store committed an unfair labor
practice by telling the owner of a strip shopping center
that union representatives were picketing and handbilling in
a common area in front of the store, the National Labor
Relations Board ruled 2-1 ("Wild Oats Markets Inc., "336
N.L.R.B. No. 14, 9/28/01 [released 10/16/01]). The shopping
center owner asked the union representatives to move and,
when they refused, called the police. Members Liebman and
Truesdale find the store's actions were "an indirect attempt
to expel the union representatives and, consequently,
constituted interference with employee Section 7 rights"
under the National Labor Relations Act.

Rejecting Wild Oats Markets Inc.'s explanation that it
simply called the owner to ask about the mall's
no-solicitation policy, the board finds the store already
knew about the policy, which was in the lease agreement, and
had never called the owner about solicitation or
distribution activities by numerous nonunion organizations
in front of the store. Dissenting, Chairman Hurtgen
maintains the store did not ask the owner to take any action
and therefore was not responsible for what the owner did. .

'MAILBOX RULE' APPLIES TO ERISA, SPLIT NINTH CIRCUIT RULES

A retirement plan administrator for Bank of America acted
arbitrarily in refusing to apply the common law "mailbox
rule" to a participant's claim that she had mailed her
lump-sum distribution election form, the Ninth Circuit rules
in a 2-1 decision ("Schikore v. BankAmerica Supplemental
Retirement Plan, "9th Cir., No. 99-16952, 10/16/01). The
function of the mailbox rule in the context of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act "is to provide employees with
a guarantee that, if the retirement plan claims not to have
received a document that an employee mailed, the document
will nevertheless be presumed to have been received by the
plan unless the plan can produce probative evidence of
non-receipt," the majority says.

In denying the participant's request for a lump-sum
distribution, the plan administrator found that the common
law "mailbox rule," which creates a rebuttable presumption
of receipt upon proof of proper mailing, was inapplicable in
the context of ERISA. The dissent contends that the plan
administrator did not abuse its discretion in declining to
follow the mailbox rule because the plan "explicitly states
that the election form must be "received," not mailed, in
order to be effective." . . . Page A-1 , Text-E-14

FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE CAN PROCEED WITH FLSA CASE, EIGHTH
CIRCUIT SAYS

A former Missouri prisoner who was on the lam from a work
release assignment could still proceed with his suit against
the YMCA for paying him only $1 an hour in violation of the
Fair Labor Standards Act, according to the Eighth Circuit
("Barnett v. Young Men's Christian Ass'n Inc., "8th Cir.,
No. 01-1211, 10/15/01).

 After Matthew Barnett walked away from a halfway house in
violation of his parole, a federal court in Kansas City
dismissed his case under the fugitive from justice rule,
concluding that he had disrupted the court's schedule
because of his extended absence.

Reviving the FLSA claim, the Eighth Circuit holds that
although he was a fugitive "there is no substantial
connection between Barnett's fugitive status and his current
civil action." The lower court's concerns of "inconvenience"
are baseless, the appeals court adds. "The district court
was in no way inhibited from setting a trial date or ruling
on the motions before it at the time of Barnett's escape and
subsequent return. His physical presence as a civil litigant
was not required at that time." . . . Page A-1

JUDGE ORDERS GARMENT MAKERS TO NOTIFY  25,000 WORKERS OF
RIGHT TO SUE

A federal district judge in the Commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands orders 22 Saipan garment manufacturers to
notify up to 25,000 current and former foreign guestworkers
that they are entitled to join a class action suit against
the employers for allegedly violating federal and local wage
and hour laws ("Does I v. Advance Textile Corp.,  "D. Mar.
I.,  No. CV-99-0002,  "motion granted" 10/16/01 ).

Judge Munson of the U.S. District Court for the Northern
Mariana Islands grants the plaintiffs' motion asking the
court to approve the distribution of notices to the workers
eligible to join the suit. Munson orders the defendants to
turn over the names and addresses of the current and former
nonresident workers and to post in the factories notices
informing potential plaintiffs--those who have worked in the
factories since January 1995--that they can join the
lawsuit. According to the order, plaintiffs' counsel will
mail the notices to workers no longer employed at the
factories. . . . Page A-8

NEWLY BARGAINED WAGES IN MANUFACTURING  UP 3.1 PERCENT, BNA
DATA SHOW

Data compiled by BNA in the first 42 weeks of 2001 show that
the weighted average first-year wage increase in newly
negotiated contracts in the manufacturing industry was 3.1
percent, compared with 3.2 percent in the same period of
2000. Nonmanufacturing contracts, excluding construction
agreements, showed a weighted average gain of 3.9 percent,
compared with 4 percent in 2000, and a median of 3.8
percent, compared with 3.5 percent a year ago.

Among new settlements reported in the latest biweekly report
are a three-year contract between Nabisco Inc. and the
Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers,
which raises pay for more than 4,000 workers by 45 cents per
hour in the first year, and an agreement with the
Communications Workers of America, covering some 56,000
employees of BellSouth Corp., that provides wage increase
totaling more than 12 percent over a three-year contract
term. . . . Page D-1 , D-2
