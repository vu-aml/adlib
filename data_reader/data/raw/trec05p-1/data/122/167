  Dear Friend,
    You may be surprise to receive this email from me since you do not know =
me personally.  I am Mr. Ramond Tanko, the  son of Mr Tanko Moaba, who was =
recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I was furnish with viable =
information from the online directory when searching for a lieable partner =
and decided to write you.
    Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johanesburg to deposite =
the sum of twenty five million five hundred thousand  United State Dollars =
(US$25.500.00) in a diplomatic security company that now move this money =
diplomaticaly to the Netherlands, as if he foresaw the looming danger in =
Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a truck box as diplomatic items of high =
value. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals =
for farms and establishment of new farm in Swaziland.
    This land problem came when  Zimbabwe president Mr. Robert =
Mugabe,introduced a new land resolution that wholly affected rich farmers =
mainly white and some few black farmers. This resulted to the killing and mob =
action by Zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society.Infact a lot =
of people were killed because of this land reformed program which my father =
was one of the victims. It is against this background that i am  currently =
staying in Italy as a refugee and to seek for a trust worthy individual/firm =
to advice me in making the rightfull investment as well as to provide foreign =
account(s) where the funds will be lodge into. Since the law of the Italy =
prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to open account or to be involved in any =
such finacial transaction.
   As regards your commission/remuneration, i  have decided to offer you 20% =
of the total sum immidiately after we cleared the consignment from the =
diplomatic  security company vault and i have  set aside 10% of the total sum =
for any expenses incurred during the course of this transaction.  
   I shall commit half of my share of the total sum into a joint venture =
project preferably in the purchase of real estate or other profitable =
business venture. Be assured that you stand no risk of any kind. As soon as i =
get your consent, i will furnish you with the details and contact of the =
diplomatic   security company and i will send to you all the documents that =
will enable us to collect the consignment containing the money from the =
security company.  
    Please contact me with this e-mail address, tankoram@netscape.net, while =
i implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction.

yours faithfully,
Mr Ramond Tanko.
