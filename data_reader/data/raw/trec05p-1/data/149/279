I don't have an electronic copy.  I just want to check with Greg to see if he does.  Otherwise, I'll fax you what we sent Georgetta.  We're expecting SoCalGas to come back with a response today.  thanks, maria

Dan asked me for a copy of the offer we sent to SoCal on the billing issue.  I must have deleted the e:mail.  Do you still have it electronically & if so, could you forward it to Dan?  He's interested in the excel spreadsheet with the $$ impact.

Thanks!
Lindy
