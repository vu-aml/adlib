U.S. TRADING SUMMARY

Stocks remain mired around unchanged levels at midday in 
lackluster August trading. Stocks initially lost ground on 
selling left over from yesterday's negative action, but 
bargain-hunters quickly snapped up shares. This helped boost the 
headline indexes back into positive territory ahead of Cisco 
Systems' highly anticipated earnings report due after today's 
session ends. However, with little conviction, the gains fizzled 
and stocks were back to unchanged by midday. Sectorwise, 
semiconductor manufacturers, networkers and personal computer 
makers were all under-performing on the session as jitters over 
Cisco's report kept traders on edge in the technology arena. 
Outperforming industries on the day included the banks, 
electrical equipment and retail stores.

----------------------------------------------------------------

U.S. TREASURY SUMMARY

Treasuries were unchanged to slightly lower in price by midday 
with shorter-dated securities under-performing due to a major 
amount of supply hitting the market. The Treasury kicks off its 
quarterly refunding auction with the sale of $11 billion in 
5-year notes, in addition to the $10 billion sale of 1-month 
bills. While the auction is supposed to go well, the overall 
level of supply has had a suppressive effect on the short end of 
the yield curve, keeping prices close to yesterday's levels. 
Elsewhere, the mild vacillations of stocks have mostly been 
ignored by Treasuries as trading action remains thin and 
relatively lackluster.

----------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENCY SUMMARY

The dollar has moved little versus the yen or the euro since 
this morning, as it trades around 0.878 dollars per euro and 
123.8 yen. The only event of note so far has been the 
productivity data, which has given the dollar some support.

MAJOR COMPANY / INDUSTRY NEWS
(All prices as of 1:05 p.m. EDT)

** MetLife Inc. (MET: 29.22, - 0.10) reported fiscal 
second-quarter profits that beat Wall Street estimates by $0.01 
as operating profits rose about 12%. Profits came from its 
institutional business, car and home insurance units. The No. 1 
life insurer by premiums earned, before one-time items, $419 
million, or $0.54 per share, versus $374 million, or $0.48 per 
share, from the year-earlier period. Wall Street expected 
MetLife to earn $0.53 per share on average.

** Procter & Gamble (PG: 70.41, - 0.34) reported fiscal 
fourth-quarter earnings that beat Street projections. The 
consumer products giant earned $837 million, or $0.60 per share,

year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of $0.59 per share. 
Procter makes such brands as Vidal Sassoon shampoo and Tide 
detergent.

** Barr Laboratories (BRL: 82.05, + 3.10) reported fiscal 
fourth-quarter earnings that more than doubled. The drug maker

versus $8.4 million or $0.23 per share in the year-ago quarter. 
Analysts had expected Barr to earn $0.50 per share on average.
