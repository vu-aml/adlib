I went back an revised our request to $100/employee.  Our rationale for setting a lower $50/employee number was to preserve PAA dollars if something new comes up.  Since the program is terminating, I thought I'd go for the full amount and HR approved.  We should have the checks by mid-week next week -- perhaps in time for the Gas Logistics Staff Meeting.
