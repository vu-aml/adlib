Lynn, We received a call that indicates Enron Compressor Services is not in Bankruptcy.  The TW gas may need to move on a Enron Compressor Services contract, or we may need to schedule the gas on an ENA receipt contract and cashout the imbalance.  If ENA can not move the gas, the gas that ENA leaves on the system will need to be sold by TW.  Not sure if ENA has a market to move the gas.

The NNG Compressor Services gas is still being scheduled.  2,010 dt/day

James Centilli is working with Mark K. and Greg Porter and may know more.  We need to meet to discuss how this contract goes forward.

Teb Lokey called to discuss the accounting of the gas given to ENA for the Ele compressors.  

ENA can not transport the gas TW gives them.  

There are a lot of unknowns at this time, I am requesting James Centilli keep us informed of what the new deal will look like.
