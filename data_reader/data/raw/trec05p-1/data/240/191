Crude Oil Futures Rise as Economy Brightens


    Crude oil futures for April delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.45 to 
$21.74 per barrel yesterday as the government released figures 
showing that the economy grew by 1.4% in the last quarter of 2001. 
The upward revision reinforced Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan's 
contention that the recession was ending and supported recent signs 
that fuel demand is picking up steam. In the past month, gasoline 
demand has grown 2.5% from a year ago, averaging 8.4 million bpd, 
helped out by increased sales of SUVs, warmer than usual winter 
temperatures and lower retail prices. Recently, total fuel demand has 
been about 2% below last year, after remaining about 4% below for 
most of the winter due to unseasonably warm temperatures, which 
lowered heating oil demand, and a sharp drop in airline flights after 
September 11th. An agreement between OPEC and other producing nations 
to trim output by almost 2 million bpd appear to be finally taking 
hold. Refiners have also cut runs because of poor profit margins, 
which could add to the total oil in inventories but lowers products 
supply. According to EIA data, oil inventories dropped by 1 million 
barrels, or 0.6%, last week, marking the 2nd consecutive week 
supplies have fallen. Heating oil futures for March delivery rose 
$0.0089 to $0.5628 per gallon in pre-expiry trading. April heating 
oil futures gained $0.017 to $0.5715 per gallon. Gasoline futures for 
March delivery on the NYMEX, which also expired yesterday, lost 
$0.003 to $0.581 per gallon. April gasoline futures climbed $0.0135 
$0.6778 per gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures on the IPE was 
up $0.48 to $21.33 per barrel.

OPEC Production to Stay Unchanged

    OPEC is will not to adjust production in its March meeting, 
according to its secretary general. OPEC expects oil prices to remain 
at current levels through the first half of this year. The cartel cut 
its production by 1.5 million bpd in January in an effort to bolster 
prices. OPEC may consider adjusting production at its September 
meeting or call an emergency meeting before then if necessary. Prices 
have rallied recently amid rumors of a possible attack on Iraq and 
expectations of a decline in inventories.

Kinder Morgan Stock Price Tumbles

    Kinder Morgan shares fell over 11% yesterday, down $5.20 to 
$41.00 per share, and shares of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners dropped 
$3.30, over 10%, to $28.60, even after its CEO denied speculation 
that it may have trouble accessing cash. Kinder Morgan, which depends 
on limited partnerships to provide tax relief, also said that those 
limited partnerships were not being investigated by the SEC and its 
accounting practices are not being questioned. Kinder Morgan Energy 
said it plans to cut its $3.5 billion debt and will make a public 
offering in May. After its $750 million purchase of Tejas Gas, Kinder 
Morgan Energy has about $1.28 billion in commercial paper 
outstanding. It said that bank credit lines will cover the commercial 
paper loans. Tejas operates 3400-mile natural gas pipeline in Texas 
with a 3.5 Bcf  per day capacity. Kinder Morgan Energy said that its 
EPS for the 1st quarter remains at $0. 44 and it expects to earn

Canadian Producers Receive C$85 Million to Drop Oil Sands Dispute 


    A group of seven Canadian producers will receive C$85 million 
from the Alberta government to end a dispute that threatened to block 
further development of Alberta's massive northern oil sands. The 
agreement with the government and Conoco will settle a complex 
dispute that has dragged on for years. Conoco became involved after 
buying Gulf Canada last year. The companies claimed they were 
deprived of their rights after provincial regulators told them in 
1999 to shutdown about 150 natural gas wells located at Surmont, near 
Fort McMurray. The wells produced natural gas from reservoirs 
overlying the oil sands deposits. The regulators ruled gas production 
would deplete underground pressures, jeopardizing plans by Gulf 
Canada to develop a C$1.3 billion oil sands project. Alberta has 
decided not to pay compensation to the producers which claim C$200 
million annually in lost revenues. Alberta's oil sands, with total 
reserves of 300 billion barrels, are expected to attract at least 
C$25 billion in spending as energy companies proceed with numerous 
projects.

Marathon Holds First Investor Meeting

    At its first investor meeting since its split from US Steel, 
Marathon Oil revealed plans for 2 natural gas projects, a North Sea 
natural gas pipeline and a LNG facility in Mexico. The LNG facility 
would have the capacity to convert 750 MMcf per day of LNG back into 
natural gas to be sold in Mexico and California. Marathon could face 
some stiff competition as there are more than a dozen plans to build 
LNG facilities in or near the US. The project which includes a LNG 
terminal, pipelines and a power plant could start up in 2005. The 
other project is a North Sea pipeline, with a 900 MMcf per day 
capacity, that would run 675 kilometers to a terminal in England. 
Marathon and US Steel traded under a tracking stock structure over 
the last 10 years or so, which restricted the performance of 
Marathons stock. In the past few years, Marathon has been revamping 
its exploration and production business, which was having trouble 
replacing it oil and natural gas reserves. Marathon has cut nearly 
25% of the jobs in its exploration and production unit since 1999 and 
sold most of its Canadian oil assets. It is now focusing on projects 
in Russia, North America, North Africa, Indonesia and the North Sea. 
Marathon was also awarded a stake in one of Saudi Arabia's highly 
valued natural gas projects and has a strong refining and marketing 
partnership with Ashland. In January, Marathon reported a 4th quarter 
loss of $898 million and has about $900 million of debt from the 
breakup with US Steel.

Oil Shares Climb on Rating Upgrade


    Shares of oil companies traded mostly higher yesterday after 
Deutsche Banc Alex Brown upgraded its rating on integrated oil 
companies, citing better prospects for prices ahead. The integrated 
oil group was upgraded to `overweight' from `neutral'. Despite the 
near-term risks to prices and equities, the fundamentals are 
improving, eroding the fear of a price war. As a result, the oil 
price forecast has been increased by $1 to $20.50 per barrel for 
2002. It also upgraded ExxonMobil to `buy' from `market perform' and 
raised its price target on its stock to $46 from $41 to reflect an 
improved outlook for earnings, returns, upstream volume growth and 
the potential for significant multiple expansion during 2002.

BP to End Political Donations 

  
    BP, which operates in over 90 countries, says that as a global 
policy from now on it will make no political contributions from 
corporate funds anywhere in the world. The move comes as US lawmakers 
consider restrictions on corporate donations to politicians and 
political parties. The downfall of Enron has added pressure to revamp 
political campaign finance laws. Enron donated about $6 million to 
politicians since 1989 and had close ties to a range of lawmakers and 
government officials. BP says that it will engage in policy debate, 
stating its views and encouraging the development of ideas, but it 
will not fund any political activity or any political party. BP 
conducts about 40% of its business in the US and is one of the 
largest foreign firms operating in the nation. Most of BP's $840,000 
in US political donations made last year were tied to Amoco and Arco, 
which are now merged with BP. At a federal level, BP's $250,000 of 
donations were split about 60-40 in favor of Republicans, while the 
$590,000 donated at state level was split about 60-40 in favor 
Democrats. In the US, BP has received criticism from environmental 
groups opposed to drilling in protected areas in Alaska. Outside the 
US it has been targeted by human rights groups for its relationships 
with Chinese firms.
