A TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES 

 This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing. 

America: The Good Neighbor. 

Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable 
editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television 
commentator. What follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as 
printed in the Congressional Record: 


> >>> "This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the 
> >>> Americans as the most generous and possibly the least 
> >>> appreciated people on all the earth. 
> >>> 
> >>> Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and 
> >>> Italy were lifted out of the debris of war by the 
> >>> Americans who poured in billions of dollars and 
> >>> forgave other billions in debts. None of these 
> >>> countries is today paying even the interest on its 
> >>> remaining debts to the United States. 
> >>> 
> >>> When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, 
> >>> it was the Americans who propped it up, and their 
> >>> reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets 
> >>> of Paris. I was there. I saw it. 
> >>> 
> >>> When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the 
> >>> United States that hurries in to help. This spring, 59 
> >>> American communities were flattened by tornadoes. 
> >>> Nobody helped. 
> >>> 
> >>> The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped 
> >>> billions of dollars! into discouraged countries. Now 
> >>> newspapers in those countries are writing about the 
> >>> decadent, warmongering Americans. 
> >>> 
> >>> I'd like to see just one of those countries that 
> >>> is gloating over the erosion of the United States 
> >>> dollar build its own airplane. Does any other country 
> >>> in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo 
> >>> Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC10? 
> >>> If so, why don't they fly them? Why do all the 
> >>> International lines except Russia fly American Planes? 
> >>> 
> >>> Why does no other land on earth even consider putting 
> >>> a man or woman on the moon? You talk about Japanese 
> >>> technocracy, and you get radios. You talk about German 
> >>> technocracy, and you get automobiles. 
> >>> 
> >>> You talk about American technocracy, and you find 
> >>> men on the moon -! not once, but several times - 
> >>> and safely home again. 
> >>> 
> >>> You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs 
> >>> right in the store window for everybody to look at. 
> >>> Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued and hounded. 
> >>> They are here on our streets, and most of them, unless 
> >>> they are breaking Canadian laws, are getting American 
> >>> dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here. 
> >>> 
> >>> When the railways of France, Germany and India 
> >>> were breaking down through age, it was the Americans 
> >>> who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and 
> >>> the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an 
> >>> old caboose. Both are still broke. 
> >>> 
> >>> I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced 
> >>> to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name 
> >>> me even one time when someone else raced to the 
> >>> Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside 
> >>> help even during the San Francisco earthquake. 
> >>> 
> >>> Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one 
> >>> Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get 
> >>> kicked around. They will come out of this thing with 
> >>> their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled 
> >>> to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating 
> >>> over their present troubles. I hope Canada is not one of 
> >>> those." 
> >>> 
> >>> Stand proud, America! 
> >>> 
> >>> 
> >>> 
> >>> This is one of the best editorials that I have ever 
> >>> read regarding the United States. It is nice that 
> >>> one man realizes it. I only wish that the rest of the 
> >>> world would realize it. We are always blamed for 
> >>> everything and never even get a thank you for the 
> >>> things we do. 
> >>> 
> >>> I would hope that each of you would send this to 
> >>> as many people as you can and emphasize that they 
> >>> should send it to as many of their friends until this 
> >>> letter is sent to every person on the web. I am just a 
> >>> single American that has read this. 
> >>> 
> >>> I SURE HOPE THAT A LOT MORE READ IT SOON
