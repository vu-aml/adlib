  Hi Paul; Happy Thanksgiving-have been hearing about enron's troubles.  How 
does this affect your work?  Were back in AZ,-left, OR just in time.  I hear 
it has been rainy and cold after we left. It's been really nice here, but 
today is a little cold and some rain.  I'm sure next week will warm up.  I 
see you have had some snow in Mts. Are you going skiing?  How is your love 
life?  Drop down and see us. Take care.  dad & Kathy.

  P.S. What are Mike and Frank's e-mail?  Sent one to Mike but it came back.  
How is everybody?  Haven't heard from them.
