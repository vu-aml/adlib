<1> 	Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Trader:

Greater hopes for a speedy turnaround in the U.S. economy 
helped Equities and the U.S. Dollar advance during a week 
cut short by America's Thanksgiving holiday. The Dow Jones 
Industrial Average closed at 9,959.71, up 125.03, on Friday 
and traders will be watching to see if it can climb above 
the psychologically-important 10,000 mark. In a quiet 
commodities sector, short-covering and firm cash markets 
propelled Cattle and Hog futures higher, while tight 
supplies and supportive technicals boosted Sugar to a nine-
week peak. Grains and Soy products were generally quiet and 
little changed, although Soyoil enjoyed a sharp gain. Crude 
Oil sagged amid a standoff on production cuts, while Silver 
continued to lose its shine and dipped to an eight-year low.
