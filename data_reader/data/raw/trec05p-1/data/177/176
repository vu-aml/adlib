FROM: MR AHMED SALEH
THE MANAGER,
UNION BANK OF NIGERIA,
ALABA INT'L BRANCH,
3 AGUDOSI ST
LAGOS-NIGERIA.

Sir,
I am pleased to get across to you for a very urgent and profitable 
business proposal, though I don't know you neither have I seen you 
before but my confidence was reposed on you when the Chief
Executive of Lagos State chamber of Commerce and Industry handed me 
your contact for a confidential business.

I am the manager of Union Bank of Nigeria Plc (UBN), Alaba Int'l 
branch, Lagos Nigeria. The intended business is thus; we had a 
customer, a Foreigner resident in Nigeria, he was a Contractor with one 
of the Government Parastatals. He has in his Account in my branch the 
sum of US$12.5 Million (Twelve million, five hundred thousand U.S 
Dollars). Unfortunately, the man died four years ago until today non-of 
his next of kin has come forward to claim the money.

Having noticed this, I in collaboration with one other top Official of 
the bank covered up the
account all this while. Now we want you (being a foreigner) to be 
fronted as one of his next of kin of the deceased and forward all the 
necessary information to be advised to you by us to attest to the Claim.
  
  
We will use our positions to get all internal documentation to back up 
the claims. The whole
procedures will last only ten working days to get the fund retrieved 
successfully without trace even in future. Your response is only what 
we are waiting for as we have put all machineries that will be 
instrumental to the success of the transaction in motion.
  
  
As soon as this message comes to you kindly get back to me indicating 
your interest, with your telephone and fax number then I will furnish 
you with the whole procedures to ensure that the deal is successfully 
concluded. For your assistance, we have agreed in principle to offer 
you 30% of the total sum at the end of the transaction. It is risk free 
and a big mega fortune.


All correspondences towards this transaction will be through telephone 
and e-mail. I await your earliest response.
  
Thanks,
Yours Sincerely,

MR. AHMED SALEH
