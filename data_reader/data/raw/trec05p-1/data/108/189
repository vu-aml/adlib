He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. "I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there," Johnson said. "Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain." </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=3664&key=1094&"><B>Emmitt Smith</B></A>, RB DAL -!

"It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right," Smith said. "I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit."   But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.   </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=3664&key=133263&"><B>Daunte Culpepper</B></A>, QB MIN - Giggles <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 10/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay.

Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=3664&key=1204&"><B>Curtis Conway</B></A>, WR SD - Giggles <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 10/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy.

T SIZE=2>The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=3664&key=1612&"><B>Oronde Gadsden</B></A>, WR MIA - Matty <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 10/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=3664&key=1288&"><B>James McKnight</B></A>, WR MIA - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 10/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FO!

McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=3664&key=187386&"><B>Ron Dayne</B></A>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 10/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington.

He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=3664&key=1062&"><B>Tony Banks</B></A>, QB WAS - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 10/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR>
<A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=3664&key=1757&"><B>Duce Staley</B></A>, RB PHI - Giggles <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 10/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=3664&key=1149&"><B>Charlie Garner</B></A>, RB OAK - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 10/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday a!

He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=3664&key=133361&"><B>Donovan McNabb</B></A>, QB PHI - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 10/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=3664&key=12623&"><B>Michael Pittman</B></A>, RB ARI - Matty <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 10/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas.

While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=3664&key=1003&"><B>Jake Plummer</B></A>, QB ARI - Frank <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 10/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be.
