"SURGE" INTO NEXT SPRING: The Pentagon announced yesterday that 35,000 soldiers in 10 Army combat brigades will begin
deploying to Iraq in August as replacements, making it possible to sustain the increase of U.S. troops there until at
least the end of this year. U.S. commanders in Iraq are increasingly convinced that heightened troop levels, announced
by President Bush in January, will need to last into the spring of 2008. The military has said it would assess in
September how well its counterinsurgency strategy, intended to pacify Baghdad and other parts of Iraq, is working. "The
surge needs to go through the beginning of next year for sure," said Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the day-to-day
commander for U.S. military operations in Iraq. Washington Post: Commanders in Iraq See 'Surge' Into '08
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/08/AR2007050802096.html

CHENEY IN BAGHDAD: Vice President Dick Cheney arrived unannounced in
Baghdad early Wednesday, and a senior Bush administration official said he's carrying a terse message to Iraq's
government: "It's game time." The trip to Baghdad -- Cheney's second -- comes as the Bush administration has been
working to foster national unity among the fractious Iraqi leaders. The parliament's planned two-month recess -- a move
that the Bush administration dislikes greatly -- is expected to be one of the topics Cheney will raise. The Bush
administration believes it is crucial that the parliament needs to keep working on important legislation, such as the
measure involving oil revenues. Shortly after landing, Cheney met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and,
following the meeting, told reporters the two discussed the country's political and economic issues as well as how to
build an Iraq that is
"self-governing and free of threats of the insurgency and al Qaeda." CNN.com: Cheney in unannounced visit to Baghdad

IRAQI NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER LOBBIES U.S. LAWMAKERS ON THE HILL: Mowaffak al-Rubaie, the national security adviser
to Iraq's prime minister, undertook on Tuesday what may have been his most challenging mission yet: trying to persuade
American lawmakers who have all but run out of patience that still more patience is required. In a whirlwind series of
closed-door meetings that began with Representative John P. Murtha and ended with Senator Carl Levin - two Democrats
who have been leading the charge for American troop withdrawals - Mr. Rubaie sought to make the case that an American
pullout would be catastrophic. "I know that they are running out of patience, and I understand this very well," Mr.
Rubaie said in a Monday interview in which he outlined his case. "And we have to play the political game. But I feel we
are on the last mile of a walk toward success, and if they let go and don't take our hand, I feel that we are going to
lose everything." New York Times: Official Takes Case to U.S., but Skeptics Don't Budge

"WE CAN TAKE THE PRESIDENT TO COURT," SAYS PELOSI: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is threatening to take
President Bush to court if he issues a signing statement as a way of sidestepping a carefully crafted compromise Iraq
war spending bill. Pelosi recently told a group of liberal bloggers, "We can take the president to court" if he issues
a signing statement, according to Kid Oakland, a blogger who covered Pelosi's remarks for the liberal website
dailykos.com. "The president has made excessive use of signing statements and Congress is considering ways to respond
to this executive-branch overreaching," a spokesman for Pelosi, Nadeam Elshami, said. "Whether through the oversight or
appropriations process or by enacting new legislation, the Democratic Congress will challenge the president's
non-enforcement of the laws." The Hill: Pelosi threat to sue Bush over Iraq bill

SIX IN TEN SUPPORT TIMETABLE FOR WITHDRAWAL: Most Americans don't believe that the continued presence of U.S. troops in
Iraq is the key to preventing a full-scale civil war there or protecting the United States from new terrorist attacks,
a USA TODAY/Gallup Poll finds. The results of the poll, taken Friday through Sunday, underscore the limited traction
the Bush administration's arguments have gotten as White House officials and congressional Democrats negotiate an
interim bill to finance the war. Amid broad pessimism about what's ahead for Iraq and the region, one-third of those
surveyed would be bothered "a great deal" if the United States is seen as losing the war. One in four would be bothered
"not at all."... Six in 10 support setting a timetable for withdrawal and sticking to it regardless of what's happening
in Iraq; 36% say the United States should keep troops in Iraq until the situation there improves. USA Today: Many see
civil war in Iraq whether or not U.S. stays http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20070509/1a_lede09.art.htm

ECHOES OF BUSH-BLANCO "SKIRMISHES": For months, Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas and other governors have warned that
their state National Guards are ill-prepared for the next local disaster, be it a tornado a flash flood or a
terrorist's threat, because of large deployments of their soldiers and equipment in Iraq and Afghanistan. Then, last
Friday night, a deadly tornado all but cleared the small town of Greensburg off the Kansas map. With 80 square blocks
of the small farming town destroyed, Ms. Sebelius said her fears had come true: The emergency response was too slow,
she said, and there was only one reason. "As you travel around Greensburg, you'll see that city and county trucks have
been destroyed," Ms. Sebelius, a Democrat, said Monday. "The National Guard is one of our first responders. They don't
have the equipment they need to come in, and it just makes it that much slower." New York Times: Kansas Tornado Renews
Debate on Guard at War http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/09/us/09guard.html

WOLFOWITZ SUPPORT "CRUMBLING IN EUROPE AND ON CAPITOL HILL": Support for World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz is
crumbling in Europe and on Capitol Hill, increasing pressure on the Bush administration to negotiate a face-saving exit
for the former deputy defense secretary. Germany's director at the bank is under orders from his government to rally
board opinion against Wolfowitz, according to a European official. Representative Barney Frank, chairman of the U.S.
House Financial Services Committee, said funding for the bank is harder with Wolfowitz at the helm.  Treasury Secretary
Henry Paulson, who controls the U.S. vote on the bank's board, must decide whether maintaining support for Wolfowitz is
worth risking a confrontation that could damage the world's largest poverty-fighting institution. Bloomberg: Wolfowitz

DeLAY: DOJ SHOULD "BRING CHARGES QUICKLY" OR LEAVE HIS FAMILY ALONE: Former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas)
is calling on the Justice Department either to drop its investigation of his wife and former political associates or
else to bring charges quickly. DeLay said he has given the FBI documents exonerating his wife, but an associate of the
former lawmaker said that agents have followed up with a fresh round of subpoenas. The inquiry appears to be focused on
determining whether DeLay's wife, Christine, earned her pay from two organizations controlled by Ed Buckham, a lobbyist
once closely affiliated with the former Republican leader, according to sources interviewed by federal investigators.
Several former employees of the groups have received subpoenas for documents, some in the past few weeks. The Hill:

"THE MOST IMPORTANT PLAYER IN THE IMMIGRATION DEBATE": For two years, the White House thought the chances of getting an
immigration bill passed in Congress lay with Arizona's Republican senator. Unfortunately for President Bush, he was
counting on the wrong one. While the White House was working with Sen. John McCain, Arizona's other senator, Jon Kyl,
emerged this year as the most important player in the immigration debate, showing that even as the Congress has grown
more liberal with Democrats in control, the immigration debate has shifted to the right. It's also a recognition that
as Mr. Kyl goes, so go a number of Republicans. "If it's good enough for Kyl, it's going to be good enough for a lot of
conservatives," said Rep. Jeff Flake, Arizona Republican and one of the top House lawmakers pressing for a bill this
year. Washington Times: White House counts on Kyl http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20070509-121221-7696r.htm

DHS PUSHES NATIONAL STANDARDS FOR DRIVERS' LICENSES: The Homeland Security Department said Tuesday that it would plow
ahead with national standards for driver's licenses, despite a highly unusual level of activity by state legislatures
opposed to the idea, and substantial second thoughts in Congress. The department said it had received about 12,000
public responses to its draft rules, in a 60-day comment period that ended Tuesday. Russ Knocke, a spokesman, said the
comments were mixed. Comments at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday were more negative. The chairman, Senator
Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, complained that security rules were supposed to be "smart as well as tough" and
predicted that state motor vehicle departments would not be able to cope with the requirements, which include verifying
all documents presented by applicants. Even renewals will require birth certificates or other proof of legal residence.

THE NRCC'S "CONSUMMATE INSIDER": [Rep. Tom] Cole has run the Republican National Committee, the Oklahoma GOP and a
lucrative consulting business. He has also been a state senator, congressional staff member and Oklahoma's secretary of
state. He loves to read cross tabs, and he's a consummate insider. "His Rolodex," says former aide John Woods, "is like
all of MySpace plus all of Facebook." But even the best political consultants know there's only so much they can do
with an unpopular client, and congressional Republicans had a 39 percent approval rating in the latest Washington
Post-ABC News poll -- nearly as low as that of President Bush and the Iraq war. Washington Post: A New Pitchman -- and
a New Pitch http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/08/AR2007050801924.html

FEC CALLED "DYSFUNCTIONAL": The six-person Federal Election Commission, which enforces campaign-finance laws, is
entering the presidential election season with three temporary commissioners who have not been confirmed by the Senate,
two commissioners whose terms have expired but who have not been replaced, and one vacancy. As a result, most of the
commissioners who are now passing judgment on campaign-finance fights will also be looking ahead to their own
confirmation battles -- a process that threatens to intensify the politics surrounding an agency that was set up to
resolve disputes over election rules in a bipartisan manner. "This is symbolic evidence of how dysfunctional this
agency is, when there is not one commissioner serving today under the normal process for appointing and confirming
federal officials," said Fred Wertheimer , president of Democracy 21, a group that has frequently criticized the
commission as failing to take sufficient steps to reduce the influence of money in politics. Boston Globe: Politics

MD GOV. TO ENDORSE CLINTON TODAY: Gov. Martin O'Malley will endorse Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton at a campaign rally in
Annapolis today and has begun encouraging his supporters to back her campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination, sources familiar with his plans said. The governor's endorsement is hardly a surprise -- when speaking in
the abstract about the next president, O'Malley has been known to use the pronoun "she" -- but it would solidify
Clinton's position in the race for Maryland's delegates to the Democratic National Convention in 2008. Sen. Barbara A.
Mikulski has signed on as a national co-chairwoman of the Clinton campaign, and O'Malley's backing would give the New
York senator the support of the two most powerful statewide Democratic organizations in Maryland. Baltimore Sun:
O'Malley to back Hillary Clinton http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/politics/bal-md.clinton09may09,1,6657356.story


NY'S SPITZER WILL ENDORSE CLINTON ON MONDAY: Barack Obama may invade Hillary Clinton's turf with the regularity of a
freeloading in-law, but Monday she's proclaiming New York is her house - with endorsements from every statewide
official. In a display of state solidarity, Gov. Spitzer, Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and Controller Tom DiNapoli
will join a slew of other state and congressional Democrats on the steps of the state Capitol to back Clinton's White
House bid. "We are gratified by the overwhelming support and excitement in New York," said campaign spokesman Blake
Zeff. New York Daily News: Hil of an army!

OBAMA'S GREENSBURG GAFFE: Barack Obama, caught up in the fervor of a campaign speech Tuesday, drastically overstated
the Kansas tornadoes death toll, saying 10,000 had died. The death toll was 12. "In case you missed it, this week,
there was a tragedy in Kansas. Ten thousand people died — an entire town destroyed," the Democratic presidential
candidate said in a speech to 500 people packed into a sweltering Richmond art studio for a fundraiser...  As the
Illinois senator concluded his remarks a few minutes later, he appeared to realize his gaffe. "There are going to be
times when I get tired," he said. "There are going to be times when I get weary. There are going to be times when I
make mistakes." AP via Yahoo! News: Obama overstates Kansas tornado deaths

NEWSWEEK "PUSH-POLLING FOR AL-QAEDA," SAYS COULTER: A recent Newsweek poll showing Democrat Barack Obama leading top
Republican presidential hopefuls could have been made up and might help al-Qaeda, conservative commentator Ann Coulter
said in her latest verbal broadside. Coulter, a best-selling author known for outrageous and often controversial
statements, was asked Sunday on Fox News' "At Large" what she thought about the survey results. "I think this is
Newsweek doing more push polling for al-Qaeda," she said, referring to campaign-season telephone calls to voters
masquerading as neutral surveys but designed to build opposition to targeted candidates. Asked by host Geraldo Rivera
whether she thought Newsweek would make up the results, Coulter said, "Yes, I do," adding, "In polls where people are
actually allowed to vote, Republicans do a lot better." AP via Yahoo! News: Coulter: Obama poll lead helps al-Qaida

EDWARDS SAYS HEDGE FUND JOB WAS LEARNING OPPORTUNITY: Democrat John Edwards said Tuesday that he worked for a hedge
fund between presidential campaigns to learn about financial markets and their relationship to poverty — and to make
money too. In an interview with The Associated Press, the former North Carolina senator said his yearlong, part-time
position with Fortress Investment Group helped his understanding of the connection but he has more to learn. Edwards
has made eradicating poverty a focus of his second White House bid. Edwards, a multimillionaire after years as a trial
lawyer, would not disclose how much he got paid for a year of consulting beginning in October 2005. He said the amount
will be revealed when he releases his financial disclosure forms due May 15. Asked if he had to join a hedge fund to
learn about financial markets, Edwards replied, "How else would I have done it?" AP via Yahoo! News: Edwards discusses
time at hedge fund http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070509/ap_on_el_pr/edwards_ap_interview

GIULIANI VULNERABLE ON ABORTION? Faced with the durability of Rudolph W. Giuliani's lead in the Republican presidential
race, his rivals are stoking new debate on whether the party should accept a White House nominee who favors abortion
rights. If he prevails, the former New York mayor would be the party's first White House nominee in a generation to
support abortion rights during his campaign. But Giuliani has used increasingly nuanced, even tortured, language in
recent days to minimize resistance to his candidacy among antiabortion Republicans... "He's well outside the mainstream
of rank-and-file Republicans on this issue, not only as someone who is pro-abortion, but someone who has supported one
of the most radical pro-abortion groups in the country," John Weaver, the McCain strategist, said in a telephone
interview. Los Angeles Times: Giuliani's foes see abortion as chink in armor

CRITICS KNOCK SHARPTON'S ROMNEY REMARKS: Less than a month after helping to get Don Imus removed from the radio
airwaves following an offensive remark about the Rutgers women's basketball team, the Reverend Al Sharpton is drawing
criticism for a quip about the Mormon presidential candidate. Hundreds of people at the New York Public Library laughed
Monday night when Rev. Sharpton joked that a Republican presidential hopeful, Mitt Romney, would lose the election. "As
for the one Mormon running for office," Rev. Sharpton said, "those that really believe in God will defeat him anyway,
so don't worry about that - that's a temporary situation."... In an interview last night, Rev. Sharpton called his
critics "politically exploitative," saying they "fabricated a nonexistent issue." New York Sun: Sharpton Criticized For
Romney Quip http://www.nysun.com/article/54070
