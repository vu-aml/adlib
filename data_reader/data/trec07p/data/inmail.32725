Tony

Thanks for the summary.

My ad hoc system is pretty good for catching flagged errors, and 
numerical errors when I have a check.  Could you (or someone else) 
comment on how easy it would be with one of these more formal frameworks 
to do three things I have not been able to accomplish easily:

- My code gives error and warning messages in some situations. I want to 
test that the errors and warnings work, but these flags are the correct 
response to the test. In fact, it is an error if I don't get the flag. 
How easy is it to set up automatic tests to check warning and error 
messages work?

- For some things it is the printed format that matters. How easy is it 
to set up a test of the printed output? (Something like the Rout files 
used in R CMD check.) I think this is what Tony Plate is calling 
transcript file tests, and I guess it is not automatically available. I 
am not really interested in something I would have to change with each 
new release of R, and I need it to work cross-platform. I want to know 
when something has changed, in R or my own code, without having to 
examine the output carefully.

- (And now the hard one.) For some things it is the plotted output that 
matters. Is it possible to set up automatic tests of plotting? I can 
already test that plots run. I want to know if they "look very 
different". And no, I don't have a clue where to start on this one.
