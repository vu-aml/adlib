Dear Sir,


I am Dr. Prince Henry Douglas, a Manager with the City Trust Bank Nigeria=

Plc., Lagos. I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable an=
d
reputable person to handle this transaction which involves the transfer
investment of money in a foreign country. 

THE PROPOSITION:
A foreigner, Late Engineer Johnson Creek, an Oil Merchant/contractor with=

the Federal Government of Nigeria, until his death a year ago in a ghastl=
y
air crash, banked with us here at CTB Plc., Lagos, and had a closing bala=
nce
as at the end of March, 2000 worth US$28.652M (Twenty-Eight Million Six
Hundred and Fifty-Two Thousand United
States Dollars) which the bank now expects a next-of-kin to claim as bene=
ficiary.
Valuable efforts has being made by the CTB to get in touch with any of th=
e
Creek's family or relatives but there has been no success. It is because
of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any of Late Engr=
.
Johnson Creek's next-of-kin (he had no wife nor children that is known to=

us), that the management under the influence of our Chairman and members
of the Board of Directors, retired Major General Umar Mai Gworo, requeste=
d
that arrangement be made for the funds to be declared UNCLAIMABLE" and su=
bsequently
donated to the Red Cross and the Trust Fund for the Brain Child of
Mrs. Stella Obasanjo, Nigerian's First Lady.
 
In order to prevent this, some of my trusted colleagues and I now seek yo=
ur
permission to have you stand as a next-of-kin to Late Engr.Johnson Creek
so that the funds US$28.652M would be released and paid into your account=

as the beneficiary's next-of-kin. All documents to enable you get this fu=
nd
will be carefully worked out. This proposal
is 100% risk-free. We have agreed that, the funds be shared thus, after
it must have been transferred into your account. 

1. 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the
funds.

2. 10% will be set aside for reimbursement to both parties for any incide=
ntal
expenses that may be incurred in the course of the transfer.

3. 60% to us the originators of the transaction. 

If this proposal is acceptable to you, then take advantage of the trust
we have bestowed on you and your company, and kindly get to me immediatel=
y
via email. dr_henrydouglas@myway.com
Please furnish me with your most confidential telephone, fax number and
exclusive bank/account particulars so that I can use these information to=

apply for the release and subsequent transfer of the funds in your favour=
.


Thank you in advance for your anticipated co-operation.

Yours faithfully,
Dr.Prince Henry Douglas
Manager CTB
