hey babe, it's your girl julie ;) 
Want to tell you that so far i'm having a great summer, how about you ? I went to the beach yesteday with my friend Sara, and many people hugging and kissing there,
which made me feel bad since I don't have that special person, you ever feel like that ? :/ My college is over for now, but I'm working alittle as a waitress, and I must say there are
many rude guys out there who give me bad compliments, but I'm getting used to that ;| The weather is awsome here, can't complain there :) Anyways, my cam is on and i'll be
home whole week, I just didn't know how to put it online, so what I did is connected it to some network which all it needs is age verification..here's my site http://ccapscgj.coffeebreakx.com/ju1/ , let's
meet eachother finally...

bye, jules :)
