funds, which is being held in a floating account in my organization. I am =

give the details of the fund if I receive your response and am convinced that =
you are willing and dependable to carry out the transaction with me in =
absolute confidentiality. We have to establish mutual trust such that it will =
be glaring to both parties that we could work with open mind. A certain =
percentage of the fund that would be mutually agreed shall be shared to you =
for your assistance on successful transfer of the fund.
