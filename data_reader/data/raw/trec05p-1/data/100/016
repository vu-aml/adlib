PURE CHICAGO @ HYPERIA OCTOBER 26th 

John Acquaviva 
PURE ON TOUR - Definitive Rec - Canada 
&
John Curley 
PURE - Chicago 

---------------------- 

Planes, trains, and/or automobiles One way or another John Acquaviva is always on the go and off to the next club or party. Despite having DJ’ed full time since 1980, appearing at over 600 international clubs and events, having played for about half a million people, he is still as busy as ever and in demand like never before. Certainly one of the most eclectic DJ's around at the club and festival level, John is well known for his vast record collection of over 40,000 pieces of vinyl. Spanning a rather significant period of club music and 12" culture, sometimes even still "dropping" a classic or old track along with the new. He is one of the very few DJ's who can enhance a room as well as appeal to a number of different crowds on different levels which explains his high demand. John began his international career in 1989 with Richie Hawtin by founding the world renown Plus 8 Records. John and Richie not only launched their own careers but also those of Dan Bell as the trio Cybersonik, Kenny Larkin, and Speedy J to mention just a few of the artists. They have also founded Defintive records to feature house music and artists launching the likes of Robotman, Barada, Omegaman and others. Although noted mostly for his DJ’ing, John was actively involved as engineer, producer and artist in the formative years and has compiled and extensive and impressive discography. The last few years has seen a number of changes to the club and party scene. Evolving as ever, the international scene has settled down with DJ's taking on club residencies. John was at the forefront of this trend and over the last two years, not only has he played in every inhabited continent excluding Africa, but you can also find him monthly at Florida 135 in Barcelona Spain and the Twilo club in New York. Cities that regularly appear on john’s itinerary every two to three months are: San Francisco USA (Nikita and Spundaes ), Montreal Canada (Sona ), Essen Germany (Tanzhaus-ex Rote Liebe ), Dusseldorf Germany (Unique ). With this regular performance base, the rest of the time is spent trying to fill requests from clubs primarily from Europe and now in North America as well as all over the world. John has had a quiet but still excellent history for production work. The most notable release of late is a DJ mix CD. "From Saturday to Sunday mix" is his best mix CD to date and was done with the cooperation of John's Spanish club where he is resident: Florida 135. It captures John over two sessions and is the best example of his mixing and DJ sound to date
