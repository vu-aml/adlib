Winners are to immediately request for the certificate of claims as soon as claims process is completed. Be advised that most payments have been approved, and authorisation will only be based on your response within the next 72 working hours from now.

General Note:You are to keep all winning details away from the general public to avoid fraudulent claim from a third party, any breach of confidentiality by direct/indirect exposure of winning details/information will lead to an irreversible disqualification.We hope to speedily process all winnings, and remitt funds to you within 7 business days after the finalisation of claims with attached agent/foreign service director. 

In order to avoid unnecessary delays and complications, please include phone number, date of birth, reference/batch number for verification, in every correspondence regarding your claims processing. Furthermore, should there be any change in your address, do inform your claims agent as soon as possible.

Congratulations once again from all members of our staff and thanks for being part of our promotions program.
