Dear Friend,

I greet you in the Name that is above all names, as 
you read this; I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Shdak Shari, a merchant in Dubai,in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with lung cancer. 

It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. 

Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for.

But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.

Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds, I ever do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity Organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. 

Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit in Europe whort eighteen Million US dollars (US$18,000,000.00) that I have with a deposit company abroad. 

Acknowledge this message so that I can introduce you to my lawyer who will handle the transfer of receivership by you of the above said funds. 

I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. My lawyer shall put you in the picture of the funds, tell you where the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss modalities including remuneration for your services.

For this reason kindly furnish your contact information, that is your address, personal telephone and fax number for confidential purpose to my personal mail box.

E-mail:shdakshari@netscape.net

God be with you.

Mr.Shdak Shari.
