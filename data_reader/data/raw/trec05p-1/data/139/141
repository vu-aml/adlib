Latest NFL Player News - Provided by Commissioner.COM

Ike Hilliard <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/19/01
Hilliard continues to feel some soreness in his surgically-repaired toe, and it is causing him to limp around a bit. He is still expected to start in Monday's game against Minnesota, but playing on the artificial turf can't be good for his injury. 

Reggie Kelly <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=! 74! 388.6&random=679&key=133334&>, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
According to published reports, Kelly (knee/ankle) should be able to return to action this weekend against Carolina. He won't make much of a Fantasy impact, however, so don't bother starting him in Week 11. 

Chad Lewis <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/19/01
Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's 36-3 win over Dallas. The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Lewis is expected to start this weekend's game against Washington. 

Steve M! cN! air <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1069&> , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game.

Packers <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=11&>, DT GB - Manchester United Updated 11/19/01
Safety LeRoy Butler suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during Sunday's game against Atlanta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the remainder of the season. Chris Akins will likely take over the starting duties in Butler's absence. 

Steve McNair <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1069&>, QB! T! EN - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game.

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=12411&>, WR STL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Hakim left Sunday's game against New England with an ankle injury. X-rays were negative, and Hakim is listed as day to day. 

Reggie Wayne <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Rod Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Dirty Bastards Updated 11/19/01
Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's game against Dallas is unclear.

Terance Mathis <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina. 

Jackie Harris <http://football434! .f! antasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Harris suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did not return to the contest, and is listed as day to day. 

Frank Sanders <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the game, however, and is listed as day to day. 

Quincy Carter!  <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=235201&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough that he's ready to return to action. However, the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason. 

James Jackson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Clubbers Updated 11/19/01
Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer it was a coach's decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fantas! y ! value might drop greatly.

Ryan Leaf <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for the time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fantasy Football. 

Kevin Lockett <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1765&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain at this time. 

Tony Banks <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told the Washington Post that there's a "definite possibility" he would be ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham would start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive Fantasy option against the Eagles. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Mandeville Marriage Updated 11/19/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee. However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when D! al! las faces Denver on Thanksgiving Day. 

Larry Foster <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.

Desmond Howard <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1268&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did not return to the game, and is listed as day to day. 

Bert Emanuel <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1186&> , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Emanuel suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Manchester United Updated 11/18/01
Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.

Mike Anderson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Dirty Bastards Updated 11/18/01
Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried th! e ! ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.

Michael Westbrook <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/18/01
Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.

Jake Plummer <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.

Michael Pittman <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..

David Sloan <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1331&>, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan,! w! ho always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.

Lamont Warren <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1112&>, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.

Warrick Dunn <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1171&>, RB TB - Bees Updated 11/18/01
Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1265&>, WR TB - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/18/01
Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
Latest NFL Player News - Provided by Commissioner.COM

Ike Hilliard <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/19/01
Hilliard continues to feel some soreness in his surgically-repaired toe, and it is causing him to limp around a bit. He is still expected to start in Monday's game against Minnesota, but playing on the artificial turf can't be good for his injury. 

Reggie Kelly <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=! 74! 388.6&random=679&key=133334&>, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
According to published reports, Kelly (knee/ankle) should be able to return to action this weekend against Carolina. He won't make much of a Fantasy impact, however, so don't bother starting him in Week 11. 

Chad Lewis <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/19/01
Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's 36-3 win over Dallas. The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Lewis is expected to start this weekend's game against Washington. 

Steve M! cN! air <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1069&> , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game.

Packers <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=11&>, DT GB - Manchester United Updated 11/19/01
Safety LeRoy Butler suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during Sunday's game against Atlanta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the remainder of the season. Chris Akins will likely take over the starting duties in Butler's absence. 

Steve McNair <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1069&>, QB! T! EN - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game.

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=12411&>, WR STL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Hakim left Sunday's game against New England with an ankle injury. X-rays were negative, and Hakim is listed as day to day. 

Reggie Wayne <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Rod Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Dirty Bastards Updated 11/19/01
Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's game against Dallas is unclear.

Terance Mathis <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina. 

Jackie Harris <http://football434! .f! antasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Harris suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did not return to the contest, and is listed as day to day. 

Frank Sanders <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the game, however, and is listed as day to day. 

Quincy Carter!  <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=235201&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough that he's ready to return to action. However, the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason. 

James Jackson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Clubbers Updated 11/19/01
Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer it was a coach's decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fantas! y ! value might drop greatly.

Ryan Leaf <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for the time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fantasy Football. 

Kevin Lockett <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1765&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain at this time. 

Tony Banks <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told the Washington Post that there's a "definite possibility" he would be ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham would start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive Fantasy option against the Eagles. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Mandeville Marriage Updated 11/19/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee. However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when D! al! las faces Denver on Thanksgiving Day. 

Larry Foster <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.

Desmond Howard <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1268&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did not return to the game, and is listed as day to day. 

Bert Emanuel <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1186&> , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Emanuel suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Manchester United Updated 11/18/01
Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.

Mike Anderson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Dirty Bastards Updated 11/18/01
Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried th! e ! ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.

Michael Westbrook <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/18/01
Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.

Jake Plummer <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.

Michael Pittman <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..

David Sloan <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1331&>, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan,! w! ho always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.

Lamont Warren <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1112&>, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.

Warrick Dunn <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1171&>, RB TB - Bees Updated 11/18/01
Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1265&>, WR TB - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/18/01
Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.
