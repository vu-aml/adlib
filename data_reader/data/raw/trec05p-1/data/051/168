Hello,

I am Mr. Hansen Asuwaneh, chief Account Auditor of a reputable bank (Name=

with-held) in Johannesburg, Gauteng Province in the Republic of South Afr=
ica.
I'm presently in Netherlands on a Diplomatic assignment. I have an urgent=

and very confidential business proposal, which might be of interest to yo=
u.


I got your contact from an administrator of the office of Chamber of Comm=
erce
of your country as a reliable counterpart in my quest for a foreign busin=
ess
partner for future investment. Frankly, my intent of the business was not=

unfolded to her as regards the delicate and the confidential nature of th=
is
deed.

Mr. Bryan Kim was, until his un-timely death, a high esteemed foreign cli=
ent
with our bank. He was allegedly reported as one the victims of the ghastl=
y
air crash of 'August, 1997 Korean Air flight 801' (http://www.cnn.com/WOR=
LD/9708/06/guam.passenger.list/).
He had a closing account of the total of US$18,600,000 (Eighteen Million,=

six hundred thousand United States Dollars) only, in a fixed deposit acco=
unt
with our bank. Officially, the mentioned amount is subsequently, expected=

to be claimed by any of next-of-kin to the deceased, since he did not fil=
l
a beneficiary/claimant in case of death in his Account Opening Form.

Now having monitored this account until its dormancy over the years and y=
et
there stands no claimant. We, (Chief Senior Accountants in the operationa=
l
Unit and myself), after the 2004/2005 annual general account audition of
the just concluded year, 2004, came up with the decision of running off t=
his
yearly recurring account. 

We therefore solicit your assistance to stand as the Next-of-kin and pres=
ent
a foreign account for the telegraphic transfer of this fund. However, all=

other processes shall be under-taken by my colleagues in the Bank and mys=
elf,
as it may be.

Do be aware that all modalities and the necessary documents have been wor=
ked
out and placed intact, all precautions also taken to ensure a hitch and r=
isk
free venture. 

Note; As part of this transaction, we shall be glad to reward you with th=
e
20% of the total sum, 75% for my colleagues and me while the left 5% goes=

for unforeseen expenses incurred by both parties. Furthermore, we do want=

to stand and rely on your sincerity and trustworthy and do not hope to re=
cord
the same case as previous whereby our former longtime foreign (American)
partner made away with the total fund after being successfully transferre=
d.
Also, we demand that you treat this with utmost confidentiality. Please,
if this email is not meant for you, kindly do not attend to it. My deep r=
egrets.


Looking forward to hearing from you with the below stated contact email a=
ddress.


Best regards, 

MR. HANS ASUWANEH 
hansasuwaneh@yahoo.co.uk 
For the Bank.
