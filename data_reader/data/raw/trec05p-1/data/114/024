        How many people actually have 8 true friends? Hardly anyone I know!

        But some of us have all-right friends and some good friends!!!

        You, my friend, have been tagged by the friendship Angel



        Which means you are a

        GREAT FRIEND!!!

        You will have good luck for two years if you send this to 8 people
or
        more.


        And, if this is sent back to you, then you will know that you are a
true
        friend.


        You must send it in 5 minutes or your good luck will be broken!!!







        Eleanor Roosevelt wrote:

        Many people will walk in and out of your life, but only true friends
will
        leave footprints in your heart.

        To handle yourself, use your head; to handle others, use your heart.

        Anger is only one letter short of danger.

        If someone betrays you once, it is his fault; if he betrays you
twice, it
        is your fault.

        Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds
        discuss people.

        He who loses money, loses much; he, who loses a friend, loses much
more;

        He, who loses faith, loses all.

        Beautiful young people are accidents of nature, but beautiful old
people
        are works of art.

        Learn from the mistakes of others. You can't live long enough to
make them
        all yourself.

        Friends, you and me - you brought another friend - and then there
were 3.

        We started our group - our circle of friends - and like that
circle -
        there
        is no beginning, nor an end.

        Yesterday is history - tomorrow is a mystery - today is a gift.
