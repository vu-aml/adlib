We need to collect ACA surcharges from the shippers.

This is my understanding too.  We can discount GRI away and we only have to pay the Gas Research Institute what we collect.  We have to pay the ACA, if we discount it away.

One more check would be Jeanette Doll.  Jeanette?

The GRI is a voluntary surcharge that the Shipper indicates they want to pay.  We just collect it and pass it on to the Gas Research institute.  The ACA is an Annual Charge Adjustment to recover cost charged to us by FERC.  We typically do not waive or discount this charge.  The other surcharges are due to past settlements and are not applicable to new expansion projects.  These are defined in the Tariff in sections 21 and 23 of the General Terms and Conditions.

James,

On Sun Devil, are we required to collect GRI, ACA, or any other surcharges?  If so, how are they applied?  If not, why?
