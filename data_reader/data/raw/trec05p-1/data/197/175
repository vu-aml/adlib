Actually, if you leave RIGHT NOW you might make it to KC for the last half 
hour of shooting time for the winter dove season, which closes today.
Now, after that you've got duck season. But you'll have to talk to BC about 
that.
Last, you've got snow crow season that lasts till long after they have flown 
north again. I still haven't gone on a tape hunt and this year might be a 
good one to do it. Lots of young birds. Anyone interested in exploring this 
option??

If none of those fit the bill, Schleicher bunny season opens in April. And 
we hope that Chet will be joining us as a lease member.
