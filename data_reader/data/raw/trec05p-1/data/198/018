Dear  Vince,
 
Many  thanks for your email. Unfortunately I won't be able to invite those editors to  speak because of the conflict that would cause with EPRM magazine, but thank you  for the suggestion.
 
Regarding your talk, please find attached a speaker details form which I  would be grateful if you could fill in and send me by the end of the  week.
 
Any  queries, please let me know.
 
Kind  regards,
 
Victoria

Victoria,  
I can cover the presentation on Day 2, Integrating Market Risk and  Credit Risk. "The Demise of Enron" is a bit risky, given that this drama is  still unfolding and the legal ramifications are still uncertain. Maybe you can  change the topic to "Energy Markets: Is There Life after Enron?" The person  who can cover this topic is either Richard Stavros or Mark Hand. They have  recently published articles in "Public Utilities Fortnightly" on this topic --  they are both editors working for this magazine. If you cannot locate these  articles, I can fax you the copies. 
Vince
