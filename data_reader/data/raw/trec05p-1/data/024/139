Pennsylvania Queenie,

General information from somebody here that recently adopted a child.

FYI, The "Kazak Princess" had me pick her up after you left and immediately
calmed down.  She was jibber jabbering at me and I assume she was asking me
not to go to work.  Later when I tried to leave, all hell broke loose.  I'm
not looking forward to sending her back, for many reasons.

Love

Kimmer
