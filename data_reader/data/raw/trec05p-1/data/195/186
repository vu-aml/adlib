Assalamualaikum,
In the name of Allah the Beneficent; the Merciful,the 
Master of the
day of Judgement , I greet you in the Name of Allah, the 
Beneficent, the Merciful .. To whom All the Praise (HQ; 31:26; 
17:111); and the most Beautiful Names (HQ: 7:180; 17:110; 20:8; 59:24) belongs.
I am from cuba and was born into a strong and devoted 
catholic family.All through my life i have been doing business and 
i was into gold mining and selling.I met our creator and the meciful 
one Almigthy Allah when i was having a business deal with 
one of my partners from U.A.E and from the day i was given 
the Islamic bath(Tawheed) my name changed to Al Ahli
Usman. On 10th Feburary 2004 myself,family and my business 
partner took a flight from kish to sharjah and we flew kish airline.We 
had a plane crash and all members of my family including my friend 
lost thier lives.I give thanks to Allah that i am one of 
the lucky ones that survived the crash.I had to return to 
my home town in Cuba and i am now left with my relatives 
to take care of me. Owing to the fact that my relatives 
knows i have reverted to islam,they have left me to suffer 
in pain and what disturbs me most is stroke that i have.I 
have developed paralyses from my waist region
downward now.But thanks to Allah,that He does what He 
pleases
(HQ: The Great Doer of what He Will. 85:16); and Is never 
unfair to His Subjects (HQ: Surely Allah Does Not Do Injustice to 
the weight of an Atom.4: 40)
I and my business partner had a deal in which he was 
suppose to make payment to me.He told me he was going to do so with the 
funds he deposited with a company.His lawyer and mine have already 
concluded all legal formalities and we were almost done with the release 
of the funds before the plane crash. Owing to my failing health i am 
taking this bold step to let you know that i want to leave 
in your care the sum of $25Million United States Dollars 
in the company for the enhancement and propagation of the 
word of Almigthy Allah.I have decided to donate this funds 
to a mosque,or an islamic organisation or better still a 
muslem that will utilize this funds the way I am going to 
instruct here in.
My main aim of doing this is for the propagation and 
upholding of the message of Prophet Muhammad(peace be upon Him). I want 
this funds to be used for Zakah and for helping the poor in fasting in 
Ramadhan and performing pilgrimage.Also in the western world,you find 
out that the message of Allah has not really gotten there.The message 
of Islam must not only be preached and upheld,but also our 
youths have to be called back to the right path and thereby reawaken their consciousness. Allah 
didnt send Muhammad(peace be upon him)to one particular tribe,but to 
mankind at large.
Surah #2.254 "Allah commands His slaves to spend out of 
what He has provided them in His way,in charity that they may 
accumulate thier reward with thier lord and proprietor. It is for this 
reason they should hasten up to do in this world before the Day of 
Resurrection in which neither bargaining nor friendship nor intercession shall 
avail. No one can bail himself out or can he ransom himself even 
if he spent,for that purpose,and earth load of gold. Nor can 
kinship avail him.(#23.101)
Allah Tests His Subjects in many different ways. This He 
Says in the Holy Quran in many Verses. To cite a few: (HQ: And thus Do 
We Try some of them by others so that they say: Are these they upon 
whom Allah Has conferred Benefit from among us? Does not Allah best know 
the grateful? 6:53)
(HQ: Do Men think that they will be left alone on saying, 
We believe, and not be tried? 29:2)
(HQ: And certainly We Tried those before them, so Allah 
Willcertainly Know those who are true and He Will certainly 
know the liars.29:3)
(HQ: Whoever hopes to meet Allah, the term appointed by 
Allah will then most surely come; and He Is the Hearing, the Knowing. 29:5)
(HQ: And whoever strives hard, he strives only for his own 
soul; most surely Allah Is Self --Sufficient, above (need of) the 
worlds. 29:6)
Hoping to hear from you soonest and do notify your 
interest to help me to propagate islam.All praise is due to Allah Who 
brought everything into existence and may the peace and blessing of Allah be 
upon our noble Prophet Mohammad(peace be upon him ) and His virtous 
adorers till the day of Judgement. May Allah bless you as you respond to my plea.

Ma-Salam, ( REPLY ME : usmanali@telkom.net)
Al Ahli Usman.
