Please change the connection in Access to estrmsp_ded from rmsprod_ded or rmsprod.
 
Some of the issues have been addressed in the data grabber part of the web site and in RisktRAC. This effort was started in September and yet to be completed. 
 
It is prefered to have one source of data going out to all, instead of multiple copies of the Access database. We welcome feedback - and reasonable time to incorporate these changes into the web functionality
 
This group did not design the Access database. In fact, I personally have not even seen it. We will be in the midst of NETCO test database setup, NETCO data cleanup, user creations, RisktRAC migration, Web migration and Unix migration to the new hardware next week. If we have the time, we will certainly help in correcting issues related to the Access database.
 
Regards,
Ramesh

I'm going into a legacy database to pull data and I'm having some problems (ODBC -connection to "rmsprod" failed.).  The name of the database is ~ORMSDBS97A.  This database was owned by an employee that is no longer with Enron.  Problem is that Jeff Gossett's team, Kathy Reeve's team, John Postlethwaite's team, Stacey White's team and Global ops used this database to query for daily reporting regarding traders VAR.  Either we need front end that can save query out for front end or we need a similar database for NETCO.  I'm neutral, however I think a similar database hook up would be quicker than front end solution.

Also, have Jeff and Stacey been able to create the benchmark report on test portfolio's?
