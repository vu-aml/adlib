Mark - Bill Brogan had told me the news about TW, and I think that will be a
great opportunity.  Waiting around for the vaunted Calpine Human Resources
machine to spring into action (note the sarcasm) is no fun, and something
this company is going to figure out the hard way.

Anyway, best of luck, both with your new role and to the Sooners going 14-0
this season.
