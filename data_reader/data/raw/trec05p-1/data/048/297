Today, Dress Wounds.  Tomorrow Redress Grievances (Revised)
by Michael Rectenwald
http://www.legitgov.org/sept11_wounds.html


At this time, let us in the the pro-democracy movement give ourselves to the
heart of democracy -- by sharing our best selves with those in pain, in
need, in emergencies, and in unfathomable grief.  Let us focus in the
immediate on the spirit, the deeper soul and body of our nation-- to
address, with loving hearts, minds and hands, our physical, moral and
spiritual wounds, which wounds are so deep and many tonight. We are all
suffering tonight, but others suffer more than we do. Let us help them. Let
us suspend our grievances for a brief time, to focus on the well-being of
our fellow human beings.

Whether policies or an implacable history has delivered this day (and both
have arguably contributed), the day is ours, and we must gather its bleeding
members, and wrap ourselves around them, as bandages around lacerations.
Some of us were eyewitnesses to the tragedies of today, who had "arms, legs,
and parts of people falling on our heads." Our nation is poorer, our lives
are lessened, and our hearts are heavy tonight.

We who love democracy, and value the lives of all people equally, find
ourselves in a difficult predicament -- find ourselves being asked to rally
behind a leader who we know is not our leader, a "leader" who has, we
believe, already inflicted wounds on our nation, a leader who has our
nation's fate in his hands, and who has already endangered us. Our anger
towards what many of us felt was a likely eventuality under Bush --
unprecedented reprisals from parties hostile to the US and his policies --
is justified. We have warned and warned: Bush is dangerous domestically and
abroad. Now, under Bush, we have experienced another unprecedented assault
on our nation (following the first one delivered on Jan. 20) -- the worst
act of terrorism to hit the American citizens in the history of the nation.
We do not think that this attack under Bush's "command" represents a
meaningless coincidence. Rather, the events are linked, part of that
"inescapable web of mutuality" that Martin Luther King referred to. There
was no escaping it -- a forcible takeover of the nation would have negative
consequences in and for the world.

The Bush political legacy, from GH to GW on down, has contributed greatly to
the ire directed at our citizens. That tensions in the Middle East have been
exacerbated by the "laissez faire" policies of the unilateralist Bush, that
Clinton was at least moving towards peace while under Bush's non-stewardship
the situation has approached anarchy, not many in the movement (and indeed,
the world) doubt. We must, in very short order, resume our assault on Bush's
international policies of unilateralism, bellicose posturing, and
treaty-breaking, and soon, before more casualties occur as a result. But at
the present moment, and I mean, in the very immediate moment, let us address
a deeper sense of democracy -- the right of life, liberty and the peaceable
pursuit of happiness of all peoples -- by taking care of immediate needs.
Let's tend to the immediate sense of morality -- loyalty and commitment to
those nearest us.

Therefore, for the brief duration of our imperilment, let's show some
restraint, with a foreknowledge of our greater purpose, in our outrage at
the ship's captain, and hope and work for the safe delivery of the ship.
Accusing Bush of deliberately causing the terrorism, for example, will not
help either the nation or our movement; it will hurt those in pain, and
alienate those who might otherwise concur with us. However, when delivered
from this hopefully short excursus into Hell, after reaching relatively safe
harbor, we can resume our work to oust the illegitimate "captain."   Our
commitment to the cause will have been no less -- rather, it will take on a
deeper significance.  We will have purified ourselves to a degree, and will
then be more fit for direct action. We will make sure our hearts are in the
right place -- that we have always only had the well-being and best
interests of our nation at heart.

Let us, then, attend to our own, and care for the nation, displaying our
own, deeper sense of patriotism -- one that loves our nation and people too
much to contribute to bellicose international posturing, and that also cares
too much to neglect our direct duties towards our fellow citizens and human
beings. The evils of today are more than enough for today.

Sincerely, 


Michael Rectenwald
Founder and Chair
Citizens for Legitimate Government.

Here's info. on how you can help in the aftermath of this disaster

* They'll be needing blood for days. I am hearing reports that some hospitals are requesting only those with blood donor cards donate today but call tomorrow to see if they need non-donor card holders' blood. The blood supply is critical.
