Letter from the Editor:

We would like to think that all of our online readers visit
HoustonChronicle.com every day.

Rain or shine. Weekends and holidays, too.

But we know that isn't the case.

And we field a number of e-mails over the course of every week asking how
to find articles that no longer are visible on the daily Web pages.

The Web site, much like the paper, is a daily product. Each day, we present
the current events of that day. And the next day, the events of that day. 

The daily links normally are functional for a couple of weeks, but they are
visible on the site for only one day. So the challenge is how to find
yesterday's links tomorrow if you fail to visit the Web site every single
day. 

Obviously, we have at least something of a solution or we wouldn't be
mentioning the problem.

The best solution would be a search routine that just hunted through all of
the functional links on the site. It's a long, involved tale why we don't
have something like this on the site, but we don't -- although we do have
it on our list of ongoing projects.

In the absence of a search routine, we suggest subscribing to the daily
HTML e-mail versions of the major news sections of the site -- page one,
local and state, business and/or sports. 

Overnight each day, we e-mail out special HTML versions of these four Web
pages complete with links to all of the stories appearing on the Web site
as the day begins.   

If you have an e-mail account that can handle HTML e-mail (basic AOL
cannot), you can get several advantages over browser-only customers.

For starters, you get a daily update in your e-mail each morning to let you
know what the major news of the day is. You can read over story summaries
without having to open your browser. But if you do want to know more about
an article, just click on it like it was a Web link and most mail clients
will launch your browser for you and open the complete article.

If you miss visiting the Web site for a few days, the e-mails will be
waiting with the links no longer visible of the Web site itself. And if you
keep the e-mails for a few days, you have your own short-term archive of
Web links to find articles from the past couple of weeks. 

A few folks who do not have HTML capabilities in their normal e-mail
accounts have set up accounts on free Web-based e-mail services like
hotmail.com or eudoramail.com just to receive these e-mails each day. 

We have links atop each of the Web pages available by e-mail where you can
sign up to have them delivered, or you can sort through all of our e-mail
offerings at:
http://www.HoustonChronicle.com/mail/manage.html

Thanks for visiting, and please let us keep you informed of the news of the
day.

**Legacy of Love and Pain

And in case you didn't visit the Web site yesterday, you missed a very
special, though painful story that we think you probably wouldn't want to
miss. 

Almost a year ago, Angela Hudson was tied up, doused with gasoline and set
on fire in her own home. That she survived at all was little short of a
miracle delivered through the quick bravery of two men who broke in past
her assailant and extiguished the flames. Still she suffered horrendous
burns over much of her upper body and face, and her survival was
questionable for weeks after the attack.

Out of this horrific incident, three generations of women in her family
have had their lives changed forever. 

Statistic show that every 15 seconds somewhere in America a woman is beaten
by a husband or boyfriend, and that every day four of them die. But
statistics do not show the mental and physical terrors of such abuse.

Chronicle reporter Daniel J. Vargas and photographer Andrew Innerarity have
followed the family's struggles since the attack. 

Their story adds a human dimension to the statistics, and it's at:

*What's New at HoustonChronicle.com

**Time to Vote

Doesn't it seem like we just finished an election?

It was, after all, December when we finally determined who was going to be
Houston's mayor for the next couple of years.

Well, folks, it's time to vote again -- party primaries to select
candidates for this year's November general elections.

The official date of the party primaries is March 12, but early voting
started Saturday and will continue for the next couple of weeks.

We have updated the Political page to include the ongoing candidate
recommendations from the Chronicle's Editorial Board and information about
how and where to vote early.

And we'll be adding a Voters Guide featuring all of the candidates and
their positions on major issues next weekend. 

All to help you cast an informed vote.

Check out the candidates at:

**Archives Access for Non-Subscribers

For a couple of year now, the online archives of the Houston Chronicle and
the Houston Post have been open to Houston Chronicle subscribers. Those of
the Post are offline for some review right now. And HoustonChronicle.com
has partnered with Qpass to provide an easy and safe way for
non-subscribers to purchase access to archival material online.

Three kinds of passes allow non-subscribers to search the archives. One is
for 30 days, another for seven days, and a third lasts for 24 hours.  To
buy a pass and start a search, simply go to

http://www.HoustonChronicle.com/archives

That site also includes answers to any questions you might have about
this new service.

Please note that the Houston Chronicle archives includes only text of
news articles appearing in the Chronicle starting in 1985. It does not
include photographs, classified ads or paid death notices. As part of the
SubscribersADVANTAGE program, the archives remain free to Houston Chronicle
subscribers.
