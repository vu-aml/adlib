Fastow is having a press conference today to prove he is still alive.  I heard he was in Houston yesterday, so he must have made a special trip to New York to have the press conference.  The conference was announced by his Houston criminal attorneys.

He is with the "other crowd".  Doesn't mean he's not going crazy doing nothing.

Oh, I thought he was in the "other crowd", the one with the suits.

I need to get you guys copy of the contract, then we can puzzle through it.

Do we need to get Reagan involved?  He is dying for something to do.

They are talking termination, which may not be justified for the asset management deal. Don't know whether that would be a good thing or not.
