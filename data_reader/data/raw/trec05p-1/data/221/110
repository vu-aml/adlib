Dan -- 

to follow up on this issue .. .per legal the "history" of their Lotus Noted dB will NOT be migrated to NETCo, so we need to confirm that the option we've given them using Outlook will work going forward

thanks

Good Day,

Getting rid of Lotus Notes for NetCo (or whatever we will be?):
The power scheduling group and the 24 hour Power Trading group both use the "East Power Discussion" db in Lotus Notes.

They need a bulletin board basically that they can all write to.  They will need to have the historical information from the Lotus Notes db saved into the new format(whatever that is).

 Let me know if you have any other questions.

Thanks,

Thanks for responding Dan

The Traders have Kobra, so that's what they'll use, it's been planned forever, they should be aware

Can you get me a list of the Lotus Notes apps that you're aware of?

thanks

I have read this.

Questions:
1. Do the traders know that they will not have Bridge Telerate?

2. Some trading groups use Lotus Notes for business applications.


Thanks for the update.

Daniel

The fact that you have seen this document is to remain confidential do not share with anyone that is not included on this distribution list

The attached is a list of NETCo transition project assumptions/expectations and issues that are being worked in anticipation of Day 1 at NETCo. I want you to read through it so that:

you are aware of what we'll be expected to support on Day 1
you can read for issues that will directly impact your ability to support

any concerns/questions that you have should be directed back to me. Please let me know when you have completed reading, even if you don't find anything that raises concern

thanks!

P.S. "Day 1" is subjective ... means first day of business. The term "Day 2" means when NETCo is actually physically separated from Estate, not the literal 2nd day of ops
