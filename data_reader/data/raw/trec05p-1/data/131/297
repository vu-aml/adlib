Texas A&M football practice was delayed this morning for nearly two hours.
One of the players, while on the way to the locker room happened to look
down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown powdery substance on the
practice field. Head coach R.C. Slocum immediately suspended practice while
the FBI was called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the
FBI determined that the white substance unknown to the players was actually
the goal line.  Practice resumed when the FBI agents decided that the team
was not likely to encounter the substance again.


Ha! Ha!
