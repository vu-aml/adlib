Chip,

Attached are Stuart's comments to the DASH.  Pretty minor wording changes.  I updated all (I hope) of the numbers with the pad gas valuation spreadsheet I sent you this morning.

Unfortunately, I couldn't track the changes in the word document.  If you'd prefer to see exactly what Stuart's comments are, I can fax you his mark-up.

Jon
