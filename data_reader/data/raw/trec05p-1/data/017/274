Hello everyone-

I have attached a file that contains company and profit center tracking for the investments going to EPI.  Please use these new companies and profit centers for your assets starting this month as the old profit centers and cost centers will be locked and can no longer be used.  If you need a cost center for your entry this month, be sure to look it up in SAP to see if it is set up.  The accountants are in the process of requesting cost centers for their individual investments and these should hopefully be set up by Thursday, Friday at the latest.  Also, please check your investments and make sure that the profit center is attached to all appropriate companies.  If you have any questions regarding this information or have any problems arise, please let us know.

Thanks,
Kristi
