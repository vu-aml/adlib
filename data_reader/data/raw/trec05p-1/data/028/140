> Notices and Conditions
> 
> Notice of Incorporated Terms
> 
> Transportation to be provided between points in the U.S. (including its
> overseas territories and possessions) is subject to the individual terms
> of the transporting air carriers.  These terms are incorporated herein by
> reference, and are made part of the contract of carriage between the
> airline and the passenger.
> 
> Incorporated terms may include but are not restricted to:
> (1) Limits on liability for personal injury or death.  (2) Limits on
> liability for baggage, including fragile or perishable goods and
> availability of excess valuation coverage.  (3) Claims restrictions,
> including time periods in which passengers must file a claim or bring an
> action against the carrier. (4) Rights of the air carrier to change the
> terms of the contract.  (5) Rules on reconfirmation of reservations,
> check-in times, and refusal to carry. (6) Rights of the air carrier and
> limits on liability for delay or failure to perform service, including
> schedule changes, substitution of alternative air carriers or aircraft or
> rerouting.  (7) This document is good for carriage for one year from date
> of issue, except as otherwise provided in this document, in carrier's
> tariffs, conditions of carriage, or related regulations.
> 
> You can obtain additional information on items 1 through 7 above at any
> U.S. location where the transporting air carrier's tickets are sold.  You
> have the right to inspect the full text of each transportation air
> carrier's terms at its airport and city ticket offices.  You also have the
> right, upon request, to receive free of charge the full text of the
> applicable terms incorporated by reference from each of the transporting
> air carriers.  Information on ordering the full text of each air carrier's
> terms is available at any U.S. location where the air carrier's tickets
> are sold.  Foreign air transportation is governed by applicable tariffs on
> file with the U.S. and other governments.
> 
> 
> Notice of Baggage Liability Limitations
> 
> Liability for loss, delay, or damage to baggage is limited as follows
> unless a higher value is declared in advance and additional charges are
> paid:
> (1) for travel wholly between U.S. points, to $2500 per passenger on most
> carriers (a few have lower limits); (2) for most international travel
> (including domestic portions of international journeys), to approximately
> $9.07 per pound ($20.00) per kilo for checked baggage and $400 per
> passenger for unchecked baggage. Pursuant to American's (and American
> Eagle's) tariff regulations, the weight of each piece of checked baggage
> will be deemed to be the maximum acceptable weight for the passenger's
> destination, unless the actual weight has been [stated on the passenger
> ticket].  This creates a maximum liability for international travel to or
> from a U.S. point of $634.90 per piece of checked baggage.  This liability
> limit may be lower for additional pieces or where the passenger utilizes
> connecting carriers.  Excess valuation may not be declared on certain
> types of articles.
> CARRIERS ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABIITY FOR FRAGILE OR PERISHABLE
> ARTICLES.  AMERICAN (AMERICAN EAGLE) ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR
> LIABILITY FOR JEWELRY, CASH, CAMERAS, VIDEO AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT,
> SILVERWARE, NEGOTIABLE PAPERS, SECURITIES, BUSINESS DOCUMENTS, SAMPLES,
> PAINTINGS, ANTIQUES, ARTIFACTS, MANUSCRIPTS, FURS, IRREPLACEABLE BOOKS OR
> PUBLICATIONS OR SIMILAR VALUABLES CONTAINED IN CHECKED OR UNCHECKED
> BAGGAGE.
> These items as well as medication and prescriptions should be carried
> personally by you.  American (American Eagle) assumes no responsibility or
> liability for baggage carried in the passenger compartment of the aircraft
> on flights wholly between U.S. points.  Baggage is designed to protect the
> contents.  Scratches, nicks, or cuts may appear despite care in handling.
> Baggage should be locked.  Checked baggage must have the passenger's name
> on the outside.  American does not assume liability for normal wear and
> tear to baggage.  Further information may be obtained from the carrier.
> 
> 
> Notice
> 
> If the passenger's journey involves an ultimate destination or stay in a
> country other than the country departure, the Warsaw Convention, and
> special contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs, will govern
> and, in most cases, will limit the liability of carriers for death or
> personal injury and in respect of loss or damage to baggage.  See also
> notice headed "Advice to International Passengers on Limitations of
> Liability" contained on your ticket for such international travel and the
> Notice Baggage Liability Limitations contained herein.
> 
> 
> Notice - Overbooking of Flights
> 
> We overbook.  If a flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat
> until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their
> reservation in exchange for payment of the airline's choosing.  If there
> are not enough volunteers, the airline will deny boarding to other persons
> in accordance with its particular boarding priority.  If we deny you
> boarding due to an oversale, and you have checked in at the gate at least
> 15 minutes before scheduled departure, with few exceptions, we compensate
> you.  The complete rules for payment of compensation and each airline's
> boarding priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and
> boarding locations.  
> SOME AIRLINES DO NOT APPLY THESE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS TO TRAVEL FROM SOME
> FOREIGN COUNTRIES.  ALTHOUGH OTHER CONSUMER PROTECTIONS MAY BE AVAILABLE.
> CHECK WITH THE AIRLINE OR YOUR TRAVEL AGENT.
> 
> 
> Refusal of Carriage
> 
> Carrier reserves the right to refuse carriage to any person who is not
> able to produce positive identification, or who has acquired a ticket in
> violation of applicable law or carrier's tariffs, rules, or regulations.
> Issued by American Airlines, Inc. (or American Eagle).
> 
> 
> Fifteen Minute Rule
> 
> Passengers who do not claim their reservations at the departure gate desk
> at least 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure time will have their
> reserved space canceled, and will not be eligible for denied boarding
> compensation.
> 
> 
> Refunds and Exchanges
> 
> Please cancel your reservation if there is a change in your travel plans.
> Failure to cancel a confirmed reservation will result in automatic
> cancellation of your entire itinerary.
> 
> 
> Dangerous Goods in Checked or Carry-on Baggage
> 
> Dangerous goods are items which can pose a significant risk to health,
> safety, or property when transported by air.  During flight, a wide
> variety of temperature and pressure changes may cause a can or bottle to
> leak, ignite or release toxic fumes. If you have any questions concerning
> what is or is not permitted in your baggage, please consult an American or
> American Eagle agent or visit us at www.AA.com.
