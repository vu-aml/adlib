Dear Friend,

I am Barrister Larry Thompson ,A Solicitor. I am the Personal Attorney to Engr. Williams Silverman,a national of your country, who used to work with the National electric power authority(NEPA) as a contractor. On the 21st of April 2003, my client and his wife were involved in a car crash along Abuja Express Road.

Unfortunately they all lost their lives in the event of the accident.Since then I have made severalfranticenquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my client'sixtended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet to locate any member of his family but of no avail,hence I contacted you to assist in repartriating the money left behind by my client in an oversea credit commission based in London,UK. Particularly, the oversea credit commission where the deceased deposited the two trunk boxes containing $26.7Million (Twenty-six Million,seven hundredthousand United States Dollars Only). 

Consequently,the credit commission has issued me a notice to provide the Next-of-Kin to claim the two trunk boxes in their custody within the next ten official working days. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for nearly 1 years now,I hereby seek your consent to present you as the next-of-kin of the deceased to claim the two trunk boxes since you are from the same country so that the two trunk boxes can be delivered to you by the credit commission. 

Upon receipt of the two trunk boxes, I will come over to your country to meet with you for the finaldisbursement of the fund in accordance to our level of commitment,I am proposing we share the money 50% to me, 30% to you and 10% for any incidental expenses incurred, while we donate 10% to charity organisations in your country and mine.

I have all necessary legal documents that can back up any claim we may make with the oversea credit commission.All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please do get in touch with me through my secured and confidential e-mail address or call on my private telephone 234-8028-5475-46 to enable us discuss further.

Thank you and Best regards,
