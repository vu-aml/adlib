I know I'm kind of bouncing around, but since we have help, we're working on whatever we can.  The following is what has been found for July 2001, then we should be good:

7/9:  Deal #676569.1 - needs an adder of $0.10, currently shows none (PGE system).  Our day total for our sales is $82,439.88

7/13 & 7/14:  Deal #683299.1 - needs correct index (not NF) of OFF - - day total 7/13 = $55,054.30 & 7/14 = $48,907.74

7/23:  Deal #695822.1 - needs correct index of OFF (day tot=$184,848.56)

7/24:  Deal #697589.1 - needs correct index of OFF (day tot=$56,573.22)

7/25:  Deal #700116.1 - same as 7/24 (day total = $48,997.04)

Totals for PGE Sales:   $2,573,217.72

AND THAT'S IT !!!!
