Chris:

Further to your call on Friday, the Letter Agreement does not require NorSub
to consent to the invoices that GE submits for the installments of Purchase
Amount due and payable by ENA.  Instead, Section 8(a) of the Letter
Agreement requires ENA to "provide NorSub with notice of each Remaining
Purchase Amount Installment which is paid by ENA (including the date and the
amount thereof) prompltly after payment thereof by ENA."

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions.

Regards,

Marisa
