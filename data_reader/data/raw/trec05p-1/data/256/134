RE: GULF COAST 3rd QUARTERLY PRODUCTION REPORT

Lippman Consulting, Inc. is pleased to announce that it has just completed 
the 3rd quarterly of 2001 production report for the Gulf Coast Region.  This 
report contains numerous charts and graphs as well as extensive text 
depicting the historical volumes produced from this region through the third 
quarter of 2001.  This report analyzes the production in various ways so that 
the reader can obtain a complete understanding of the supplies contained in 
this dynamic region. This is truly a bottoms up report.  Lippman Consulting 
is currently publishing twelve separate monthly reports covering each of the 
area's specific regions that make up the Gulf Coast.  Extensive detailed data 
is contained in each of those reports. This quarterly report, which compiles 
the data for each of those area reports, is intended to be a summary report 
for our clients that do not want that level of detail but want to be advised 
on the overall Gulf volumes. The Gulf Coast region contains almost 50% of the 
domestic production and therefore is very important to the overall national 
gas markets. 

The cost for this report is $300 on a quarterly subscription basis or the 
report can be purchased on a one-time basis for $450. If you would like 
additional information or to order this report, please feel free to contact 
me by e-mail at Lippmanc@AOL.com or phone at 915-581-1668.

George Lippman,
President
Lippman Consulting, Inc.
