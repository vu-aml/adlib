I suggest you get in on the evening of Wednesday, Nov. 7 and depart in the afternoon (probably 3pm or after) on Nov. 9.  
 
As for travel, I guess it depends on your budget and schedule - those flights with stops aren't necessarily very convenient.  You should call the Travel Agency in the Park, but my quick search on-line found that the only direct flights, on Continental, are running just over $1,000.  America West tickets with a stop in Phoenix are about $450.  I found a flight on Southwest departing from Hobby (via Phoenix) for $385 (see below).
