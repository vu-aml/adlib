Marcus:

	I am in receipt of this and will attempt to move forward on it.  Just so you know, there are issues in getting these things signed.  Derrick will not sign until I get the sign off of a Weil attorney and Haedicke remains out of town until tomorrow.  Hopefully, I will be able to get the Weil approval today with the other to happen shortly.

Thanks,

Jeff

Jeff, we are finally in  the position to sell our interest in Energoville today. Any chance, to get this resolution done for a sale today?

We have been negotiating this sale for a very very long time and this is quite literally our one and only shot at it - given that our reps and warranties had now gone away, this price is the best we can possibly get for it (we once hoped to get EUR 2.1 million)
