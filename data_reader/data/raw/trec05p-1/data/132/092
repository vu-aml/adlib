David, could you let me know who on your team has the right skillset to participate in a conference call Monday morning to discuss phase in of MISO operations.  I suspect that it is the person who primarily arranges transactions through OASIS and/or schedules.  As discussed on Monday afternoon this is the chance to ensure that our operational people are on top of the transition to MISO.

cheers
MR

Smith, could you let me know who the right scheduler is.....

Mike,

MISO announced at the Policy Subcommittee meeting yesterday that it would be phasing in Day One operations pursuant to the proposal outlined below.  Commercial operations would commence on the basis of MISO's ISO (rather than RTO) status, although MISO anticipates that FERC will designate it an RTO on December 19 (this anticipation on the basis of discussions between Jim Torgenson and FERC at the NARUC meetings last week).  MISO foresees many questions regarding implementation of the phasein, and is requesting that a working group representing all sectors be established to work with the transmission owners to accomplish the phase-in.  A conference call will be held on Monday November 19 to put together the working group and organize its activities (call in number not yet distributed).  It was clear from yesterday's meeting that the first efforts of the working group will be to work through implementation issues for the December 15 actiivities; subsequent efforts will be dedicated to January 1 and February 1 implementation.  The outcome of the working group's December 15 implementation recommendations will be presented to an interim meeting of the Advisory Committee on December 5.
