Thanks.  I may need your assistance.  Apparently some billings have fallen through the cracks and I am trying to figure out what should be happening.  I will get with Mary on the copies.
Thanks again.
Karen

Karen,  Please get with Mary Ogden.  She can retrieve the schedules for you from our legal files.  Unfortunately, I am not aware of a brief of these contracts.  I can help you work through the agreements if needed.  Thanks.

Subject:	Schedules to Bridgeline Contribution Agreement

Gerald,
I am researching several outstanding receivables from Bridgeline.  I am looking for the Schedules to Contribution Agreement, which is item 3 in the index of documents.  Do you know where I might obtain a copy?  Also, is there any type of brief available on these contracts.  I have seen one for ECS, so I was hoping that one might be available for Bridgeline.


Thanks for your help.
Karen
