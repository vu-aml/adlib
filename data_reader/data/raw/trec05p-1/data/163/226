Terrie,
We're working (with you I believe!) on getting some approved information to go onto the web tonight.
This will include stuff around the $4500, the fact that termination packages are being stuffed and mailed today.
Expense reports - not a straightforward answer; we expect clarification within the next 48 hours - we'll need to write a sentence that reiterates the statement of :
"We are getting answers to key questions concerning employee expenses.....please be patient as we ensure that when we communicate wit you, you get the facts"
