Natural Gas Futures Rally on Short-Covering 


    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX jumped $0.155 
higher Friday to $2.774 per MMBtu as winter's chill and forecasts for 
continued cold throughout January for eastern states and the Midwest 
had locals scurrying to cover their short positions. The March 
contract gained $0.123 to $2.746 per MMBtu. A flurry of buying 
started early in the session, a reaction in part to Thursday's 
liquidation on the January contract expiration. Clearing the books of 
Enron-related hedging losers in time for year-end could also be 
playing a role in Friday's rally. Some of the volatility over the 
past month has been triggered by larger books balancing their hedges. 
Enron's demise has forced counter-parties to recontract supplies, 
pushing the market with offers or with bids. Shuffling monthly 
spreads from fall to winter and balancing volumes bought at higher 
prices during the summer for storage will also trickle to a stop mid-
January as some storage operators call for contracted withdrawals. 
The AGA will again delay its release of last week's storage data 
until Thursday because of the holidays. For the first time this 
winter, many traders are anticipating a triple digit withdrawal this 
week. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was 
generally flat to $0.10 higher Friday. Natural gas for next day 
delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.01 to $2.64 per MMBtu.

Shareholder Activism Driven by Enron Problems

    Pension funds, stockholders groups and outspoken investors have 
began flooding the firms they own with proposals for change driven 
this year by the collapse of Enron. Shareholders are using this 
year's filings to try to make sure other companies don't go the same 
way as Enron. What is new this year is the auditor independence 
proposals. Pension funds affiliated with the United Brotherhood of 
Carpenters union have filed 12 proposals calling on companies not to 
hire the same accounting firm to do both audit and non-audit work. 
Enron, paid Andersen $52 million in 2000 for both audit and non-audit 
services, a dual relationship that has raised questions about 
Andersen's judgment. The proposals are part of an annual flood that 
hits companies around the end of year. Their goal is to be included 
in the company's proxy statement, which is mailed to all 
shareholders, as an item to be brought to the floor of the company's 
annual meeting for a vote. If companies want to exclude qualified 
proposals from their proxies, they need approval from the SEC. In 
2001 the SEC handled 438 requests from companies for permission to 
exclude shareholder proposals from their proxies.

TXU Proposes Settlement for Overcharges

    TXU Electric has filed a plan with the Texas PUC to settle 
charges that it erroneously collected stranded payment costs before 
the state opens its power market next week. The costs are aimed at 
offsetting expenses for building generating plants and related 
regulatory financing plans prior to deregulation. As natural gas 
prices soared a year ago, the PUC alleged that TXU and other Texas 
utilities had no stranded costs related to generating assets because 
of the large amount of natural gas fired generation in the state. 
Climbing prices made natural gas fired plants almost as costly to 
operate as nuclear plants. If the settlement is approved by the PUC, 
TXU will return $350 million to retail electric suppliers over 2 
years by providing credits on transmission and distribution rates. 
TXU said it may take a charge of less than $50 million in the 4th 
quarter because of the settlement. TXU also said it would eliminate 
any remaining stranded costs related to its Comanche Peak nuclear 
station. TXU also proposes that the PUC authorize it to issue $500 
million in bonds in early 2002 and $800 million after 2003 related to 
the utility's regulatory assets or previous financing agreements 
approved by the PUC. The settlement also cuts a possible penalty to 
$90 per customer from $150 in the event TXUs retail affiliate retains 
more than 60% of its customers after the first 2 years of 
competition.

Exelon Power Team to Double its Wind Capacity 
  
    Exelon Power Team will purchase the output of a 65 MW wind 
facility in Tucker County, WV for 20 years from Backbone Mountain 
Windpower. The project will include about 42 wind turbines, each 
producing about 1.5 MW. The 65 MW facility will utilize the latest 
wind turbine technology and will be the largest commercial wind 
energy facility in the eastern US. The project is expected to be 
operational by December 2002. It will interconnect with the Allegheny 
Power System in the PJM West RTO and will be integrated with the PJM 
RTO. Earlier this year, Power Team signed 20-year purchase agreements 
for 9 MW from the Somerset Wind Power Project, 15 MW from the Mill 
Run Wind Project and 52 MW from the Moosic Mountain Wind Farm near 
Scranton. This agreement brings Power Team's wind portfolio to 144 
MW. The Backbone Mountain Wind Project will add to the amount of 
clean energy available to customers in the PJM territory. Community 
Energy and Power Team are jointly marketing the output of wind 
projects. Large commercial customers, such as the University of 
Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University, Penn State University, 
Philadelphia Suburban Water Company and Giant Eagle Foods, have 
already purchased wind energy from Power Team and Community Energy 
for periods from 15 years. Power Team's current renewable supply 
portfolio includes wind, landfill gas, hydroelectric, and biomass 
generation.

FERC Order Sets Direction in Midwest

   The FERC December 19th decision that the Midwest ISO be the 
vehicle for a single, regional transmission organization in the 
Midwest is an important decision.  It will spark the development of a 
competitive regional power market in the Midwest, of particular 
importance to energy-intensive Midwestern states, according to a 
customer coalition active in the federal arena. The Coalition of 
Midwest Transmission Customers and the Industrial Energy Users-Ohio, 
stated that FERC's decision paves the way for actual implementation 
of plans to get a truly independent entity for the Midwest 
transmission grid, that encompasses twenty states and Manitoba, 
Canada, up and running. The coordination so critical to system 
reliability and Ohio's business and industry can now proceed on a 
timeline that should allow the Midwest to avoid a repetition of 
problems we saw a couple of summers ago.  Because the Midwest economy 
is so energy-intensive, the Coalition hopes to see the ISO continue 
with development at a challenging pace since an effective regional 
marketplace will benefit not only residential users but also 
Midwestern businesses in their efforts to thrive in the worldwide 
marketplace. The FERC Order also found that creation of the Alliance 
RTO does not satisfy scope and configuration requirements spelled out 
in FERC's Order 2000. The Commission made plain that the Alliance 
companies could continue with the formation of the for-profit 
Transco, but under the Midwest ISO umbrella. The significance of 
this, is that the FERC is focusing on the importance of a single 
organization as opposed to its form. From the perspective of market 
participants, both buyers and sellers, this and other recent FERC 
decisions are strong indications that a highly coordinated and 
competitive marketplace is the goal for the industry. FERC's November 
20th orders preventing several utilities from using their market-
pricing authority in areas where they have market power is as 
critical to nurturing an effective market as the order for a single 
Midwest RTO.

K2 Innovative Drilling Technology 

   K2 Energy in conjunction with Midnight Sun Drilling from 
Whitehorse, Yukon, has made a major break-through in shallow natural 
gas drilling. By utilizing a hard rock mining rig and adapting its 
reverse circulation center sampling technology to shallow low-
pressure gas drilling, the resulting formation damage is virtually 
eliminated. The air circulates down between the inner and outer drill 
pipe, drives the air hammer, and reverse circulates the rock cuttings 
back up to surface. This virtually eliminates drilling damage to the 
formation.
