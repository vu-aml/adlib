I talked to Ray Bowen today regarding the Finance Comm. book.  He and Jeff will combine the old CFO and Treasurer's report into one Finance Report.  Please make a placeholder on the agenda.  The materials will most likely be handed out at the meeting, so please put in a sheet saying that behind their tab.  

Thanks to each of you for your diligence on this effort. Paula
