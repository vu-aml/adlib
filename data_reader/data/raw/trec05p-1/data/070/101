Williams Files Evergreen Expansion Project 
SALT LAKE CITY -- A unit of Williams (NYSE: WMB) announced today that it has filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to construct and operate the Evergreen Expansion Project in the state of Washington. The proposed $240 million project is designed to expand Williams' existing Northwest Pipeline system from Sumas to Chehalis, Wash., (Sumas-Chehalis Corridor) to meet the demands of new electric generation facilities and to provide additional capacity in the Plymouth to Washougal, Wash., corridor (Columbia River Gorge Corridor) for existing firm shippers. 
The Evergreen Expansion Project will add 67,000 additional horsepower at five compressor stations and four sections of new pipeline loops, totaling 28 miles, in the Sumas-Chehalis Corridor. The new pipeline segments will generally be placed in existing right of way, parallel to Northwest's natural gas transmission system. To increase north flow capacity for existing firm shippers, 24,000 additional horsepower will also be installed at five compressor stations located within the Columbia River Gorge Corridor. 
"The additional 276,000 dekatherms per day of natural gas delivered by the Evergreen Expansion Project for the Sumas-Chehalis Corridor will supply the fuel needed for five new power plants in the state of Washington," said Greg Snow, project manager of business development Williams' Northwest system. "This gas will supply the fuel for power plants to generate 1,900 megawatts of electricity, which can serve approximately two million homes. In addition, the 54,000 dekatherms of additional capacity through the Columbia River Gorge Corridor will reduce existing firm shippers' reliance on displacement capacity." 
Pending FERC approval, construction on the Evergreen Expansion Project is scheduled to commence the summer of 2002, with in-service dates of June 2003 for the Sumas-Chehalis Corridor capacity and November 2003 for the additional Columbia River Gorge capacity." With a system that spans the continental United States, Williams' gas pipeline unit is one of the nation's largest-volume transporters of natural gas. The company is based in Houston and has offices in Salt Lake City and Owensboro, Ky. Northwest Pipeline operates a 3,964-mile system delivering Rocky Mountain and Canadian natural gas to markets in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming and Colorado. The system has a design capacity of 2.9 billion cubic feet per day.
