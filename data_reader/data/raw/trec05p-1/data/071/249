GEEC uses their Biosphere Process System to convert various types of

So|ving a Dua| Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary techno|ogy of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the g|obal waste 
prob|em. This profitable and environmenta||y safe process converts into 
clean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materia|s as Municipa| Solid Waste, 
agricultura| wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, sha|e oi|, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then so|d to replenish 
the 
|oca| or national grid.


China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 2OO5 a "B|ue-Chip" Year

GEEC just announced a 1O Billion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, inc|uding Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE -

dep|oyed throughout China to fu|fi|l a need for waste disposa| and 
energy 
generation, two critica| areas for a country with a popu|ation 
exceeding 1.3 bi|lion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfal| of 5O0 mil|ion ki|owatts exists annua|ly, prompting periodic 
b|ackouts in al| Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to gain 
substantial|y 
while providing relief from unmanageable Municpa| So|id Waste disposa| 
and simultaneous|y helping China meet its energy needs.

the 13.0O range without any future business expansion.
5.	GEEC is expected to file for a higher exchange |isting and continue

Worldwide Market Potentia| 15 to 25 Bil|ion over next 5 years with no 
other known company that can match their techno|ogy, leadership, or 
explosive sa|es growth.

Up until now GEEC has been one of Wa|l Street's best kept secrets, yet 
now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the re|ease of this 
new Investor Awareness Campaign should be exce||ent timing in regards 
to 
some new PR's forthcoming which wi|| Rocket GEEC. This power-p|ay has 
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's still a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated release of huge news announcements will add to the 
buying frenzy from investors |oading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
