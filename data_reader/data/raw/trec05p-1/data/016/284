                  CONFIDENTIAL
ATTN Dear One,

It is a pleasure to introduce to you a business that will make the beginn=
ing
of never-ending family relationship,business source and I hope that this
proposal will not be an inconvenience or embarrassment to you. I must not=

hesitate to confide in you this simple and sincere business.

I am SUZANNE JOHNSON the only daughter of the late DR.ADAMS JOHNSON from
Sierra Leone. Iam 20years of age,My father was a prosperous Cocoa and Gol=
d
merchant in sierra leone before
his untimely death. After his business trip to Abidjan - Cote d'Ivoire,to=

negotiate on a Cocoa and Gold business he wanted to invest inAbidjan - Co=
te
d'Ivoire.

A week after he came back from Abidjan, he was attacked with my mother by=

unknown assassins. My mother died instantly but my father died after five=
days
in a private hospital on that faithful afternoon. I didn't know that my
father was going to leave me after I had lost my mother and my junior bro=
ther
who died in the refuge Camp due to lack of good medical care.
But before my father gave up the ghost, it was as if he knew he was going=

to die.

May my father's soul rest in peace, he disclosed to me that he
has a consignment in one of the security company here but the security co=
mpany
doesn't know that the content is money because he deposited it as family
valuables for security reasons
the sum of US$22,000,000.00 (Twenty two Million United States Dollars Onl=
y)
here in Abidjan - Cote d'Ivoire and that I was made next of kin to inheri=
t
this sum.

That money was meant for his Cocoa and Gold Company
he wanted to establish in Abidjan - Cote d'Ivoire.
But since I have no experience or interest in this type of business he ad=
vised
me to seek a reliable and trust worthy business partner who will assist
me to transfer this funds abroad strictly for investment purposes and for=

guidance.

Now I am soliciting for your assistance to help me transfer this money so=

that we should invest it in any meaningful lucrative business in your cou=
ntry
because this is my only hope in life.
Waiting anxiously to hear from you so that we can discuss
the modalities of this transaction. Please kindly contact me on using the=

above email address immediately for more discussion.

Thanks for your kind attention.

Yours sincerely,

SUZANNE JOHNSON
