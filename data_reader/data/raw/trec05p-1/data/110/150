Mr. Lay:

Thank you again for lunch yesterday.  I really did enjoy spending time with you are your family.  

As I mentioned yesterday, I have some internal public relations suggestions for your review.   Please feel free to contact me if you wish to discuss this further.  I would welcome the opportunity to expand on these suggestions and help in any way you deem necessary.  

I am off to GA to make you some money and will be back on Wednesday.  You are in my thoughts and prayers.

Yours sincerely,
