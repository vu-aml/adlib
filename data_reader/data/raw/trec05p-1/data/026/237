Greg/Dave:
 
If the opportunity presents itself at the Energy Forum, I would appreciate any discussion of the intrastate pipeline market.  Specifically, the benefits of price transparency and liquidity on the intrastate pipelines to ensure efficient movement of gas to end users.  This will become more of a factor with greater instantaneous gas demand due to the dispatch of gas-fired generation.
 
Thanks,
Brian
