It's that time of year again...Thanksgiving.  And with it comes the
beginning of another festive holiday season. During this hectic time,
you'll tend to do things that are out of your normal routine: shopping
at the mall for hours on end, snacking in-between meals, eating out and
traveling.  This crazy schedule can often affect you and your blood
sugar - sometimes you may not even realize it.  The ADA has resources
that can help.

TRAVEL...
Wouldn't it be great if someone made your packing lists and wrote down
all the things you need to do before you travel? Well, someone has.

Ever feel like everyone can eat junk food but you?  Finally, a
collection of snack recipes for people with diabetes! The Diabetes
Snack, Munch, Nibble, and Nosh Book features snack ideas for parties and
crowds that are diabetes-friendly. Now even YOU can enjoy festive food
items such as chili con queso, chips and black bean salsa, pesto, and
