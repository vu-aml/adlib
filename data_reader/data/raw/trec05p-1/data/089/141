Jeanne, Perry,

Is the data current? If Perry is comfortable that the data is ready to go, I would like to place this into production today 10/19/01 if at all possible.

Mary Kay, Mary,

The requested changes have been made to the "TW Unsubscribed Capacity". Please review the test site http://twdev.ets.enron.com/twdb/etfr_unsubcapasp.html and at your earliest convenience let me know if you are satisfied with the format changes.  Patty is looking into when the table changes will be made so we can place into production.
