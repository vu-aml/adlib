We are pleased to announce the latest addition to the Corporate Benefits Team and clarify the roles of my direct reports.

Chris Rahaim accepted the position of Director of Benefits and joined Enron on August 6, 2001.  Chris comes to Enron from Entergy in New Orleans and has welcomed expertise in the area of Mergers and Acquisitions.  Chris recently obtained his law degree from Loyola University and has relocated his wife and 2-year old son to the Houston area.

Chris will oversee the day-to-day operations and management of the Health & Wellness, Pension and Savings Plans.  He will also function as the point person for benefits-related issues due to any upcoming or transitional mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.

Maryann Roman de Mezza has added management of the Health and Wellness Plans to her current role as the Director of Wellness.  Maryann brings her unique and extensive expertise of disease and vendor management to this area in a further effort to integrate Wellness programs with management of illnesses reported.  Maryann will report to Chris Rahaim.

Mikie Rath will concentrate on special projects, HR Commercialization efforts and employee benefit communication.

Sandy Huseman will concentrate on benefits accounting and return on investments for any plan design changes and implementations.  She will continue to provide guidance for the Health & Wellness team.
