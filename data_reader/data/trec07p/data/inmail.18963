Losing The Public Relations War: Abbott Struggles In Thailand

For the past few months, Thailand has beaten up big pharma over the cost
of its medicines by issuing compulsory licenses for three drugs and
threatening still more. But Abbott, in particular, is feeling the brunt.

Unlike Merck and Sanofi-Aventis, Abbott withheld registration for new
drugs, including a new version of is Kaletra AIDS pill for which the
Thai government issued a license. The move was quickly criticized as
callous by many patient advocates and faith-based investor groups.

Through it all, Abbott kept a low profile. No statements were issued on
its web site and executives weren't advocating their case publicly. Now,
though, as Abbott's annual meeting approaches this Friday, the drugmaker
is suddenly making noise.

This past weekend, Abbott made a splash by offering to sell the new
Kaletra version in Thailand if the government would repeal the
compulsory license. Abbott appeared to be blinking, although some AIDS
activists say the offer is really a form of blackmail.

And Abbott ceo Miles White is no longer invisible, although he didn't
mince words in a chat with The Wall Street Journal. "Some would like to
make this an HIV issue, but the fact is, it's not," White says. "It's
clear that this continues to be about compulsory licensing and the
potential for its abuse."

This was a long overdue step. Big pharma was badly bruised in its patent
fight with South Africa several years ago and Thailand is close to
taking on the same proportions. But this time around, Abbott and Miles
White are threatening to become Bangkok's poster child.

Granting an interview to The Wall Street Journal on the eve of an annual
meeting may placate some investors, but it may not go far enough.
Through its hardball tactics and weeks of stoney silence, the drugmaker
has made itself a target for AIDS activists and patient advocates.

Beyond the jousting over the dry language found in international trade
rules, Abbott forgot a crucial lesson that, ironically, big pharma
boasts about in its ubiquitous advertising - compassion for patients.
Yes, it's a delicate balancing act when investors demand profits, but so
far, Abbott is nowhere near finding its equilibrium.

There's a round-up story today for those who haven't followed the issue
in The Wall Street Journal.

HARSH MEDICINE
Thai Showdown Spotlights Threat to Drug Patents

Abbott Protests Move
To Buy Copycat Pills,
But It Yields on Price

By JAMES HOOKWAY and NICHOLAS ZAMISKA
April 24, 2007; Page A1

BANGKOK, Thailand -- This January, the Thai government sent the kind of
letter that every global pharmaceutical company dreads to receive.

"Dear patent holder," read the letter to *Abbott Laboratories*, maker of
the AIDS drug Kaletra. "As protected by its patent and monopolized by
your company, Kaletra is very costly." Therefore, the letter went on,
Thailand was preparing to break Abbott's patent so it could import or
produce cheaper copies of the drug.

Since then, Abbott has been locked in a tug-of-war with Thailand that
underscores how developing countries have become a battleground over
patent rights.

Abbott brought on a storm of bad publicity by revoking plans to bring
new drugs to Thailand, including its latest version of Kaletra.
Activists called that the "nuclear option" and said it was unprecedented
for a drug company to withhold medicines from a country over a
commercial dispute.

Now Abbott is partly backing down. The company said over the weekend it
is willing to sell the new version of Kaletra in Thailand at a deeply
discounted price that it offers some other countries, so long as the
government respects its patent. It's unclear whether the Thai government
will accept the offer.

Global drug makers are increasingly looking to emerging markets to
compensate for slowing growth in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Abbott's
troubles in Thailand suggest that cracking the new markets can be tough
because governments are driving a hard bargain on price. They are using
the threat of breaking patents to get good deals. Thailand has won the
support of nonprofit groups and world organizations while meeting little
resistance from the U.S. government.

"We've been talking with the drug companies for four years about
reducing the price of treatment, but with no result," says Thailand's
health minister, Mongkol na Songkhla. "Now we have no choice." Thailand
has already brought in its first shipment of copies of efavirenz, a
Merck & Co. AIDS drug whose patent it broke.

Abbott and other drug makers argue that without protection for their
intellectual property, drug makers have no incentive to develop
lifesaving medicines in the first place. Teera Chakajnarodom, who
represents the multinational drug industry's trade group in Bangkok,
calls Thailand's move "very shortsighted."

Some pharmaceutical executives question Thailand's real motives,
suggesting the government's military-installed government, which took
power in a coup last year, is using populist rhetoric and policies to
curry favor with the Thai people. Dr. Mongkol says that, as a physician,
it's his duty to look after patients' needs. He adds, "I'm not a thief."

A number of emerging nations are working on plans to slash drug costs.
Lawmakers in the Philippines are debating legislation that would permit
breaking patents in certain circumstances and allow the country to use
more generic drugs to fight AIDS and potential pandemics. Kenya is
considering breaking patents as Dr. Mongkol has done to open the door to
cheaper copies.

In an interview last week, Indonesia's U.S.-educated trade minister,
Mari Elka Pangestu, said her country might introduce price caps to bring
the price of branded drugs closer to the level of generic equivalents.
"The difference in price between nongenerics and generics is perceived
to be too high," Ms. Pangestu said.

Such moves could threaten the ambitions of drug companies in developing
nations -- especially those such as Thailand that are growing wealthier.
While the U.S., Europe and Japan account for the vast majority of sales
at big Western drug makers, their growth is slowing. The U.S. this year
will contribute about 36% of total growth in pharmaceutical sales, down
from 54% five years ago, according to a forecast by IMS Health, a
research and consulting firm.

Merck has said that it expects revenue in key emerging markets,
including China, India and Eastern Europe, to reach $2 billion by 2010,
double the 2005 level. Abbott's sales in the U.S. dropped 7.5% in 2006
to $11.5 billion, but it made up for that with 10.9% growth in
international sales to $10.9 billion.

Supachai Suwannasit is typical of the patient these companies would like
to attract. He is a 46-year-old administrator at a Bangkok media firm.
To treat his chronic back pain, Mr. Supachai first used cheap generic
drugs, which were covered by his limited insurance policy. Then he opted
to spend more of his own money for brand-name drugs made by Western
companies. "The brand-name drugs were much more effective in relieving
the pain. It was worth paying more to use them," says Mr. Supachai.

Thailand began inching toward its confrontation with the pharmaceutical
industry in 2004, when it pledged to provide free AIDS medicine to
everyone who needed it. At the time Thailand was beginning to introduce
a government-funded health-care system to provide basic care for all
citizens, along the lines of universal health-care systems in Europe and
other developed regions.

With a half-million Thais infected with HIV, the drugs loomed as a major
cost. Dr. Mongkol, then a senior bureaucrat in Thailand's health
ministry, discussed the issue with AIDS activist Wirat Purahong, a
former sugar-cane cutter who nearly died of AIDS six years ago before he
was placed on a government short list of people who could be treated.
Mr. Wirat argued that breaking patents was the only way to bring down
prices.

Over time, that view gained a friendly hearing. Last year, the World
Bank told Thailand it would have to consider breaking patents if it was
serious about including AIDS treatment in its new health program. The
United Nations' AIDS agency also sent a letter of support.

When the military took power in September, exiling pro-business Prime
Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, Dr. Mongkol was appointed Thailand's new
health minister. He quickly seized his chance to push for cheaper AIDS
drugs. In November, his deputies began sending out letters to foreign
patent holders.

The letters said Thailand was planning to create what is called a
compulsory license -- compelling the patent holder to license its patent
to the Thai government. The move amounts to a seizing of patent rights.
Once the government holds the license, it is free to import copies of
the patented product or make the product itself. The Thai government has
a drug-manufacturing arm that is capable of copying foreign drugs,
although it typically turns first to generic-drug makers in places like
India.

Thailand says it is obeying the rules of the World Trade Organization,
which allows compulsory licenses in a national emergency or cases where
the member country needs the drug for noncommercial use. Critics of
Thailand say the loophole was designed only for extreme cases, such as a
country that faces pandemic flu and needs to produce vast quantities of
a patented antiflu drug.

The first letter went to *Merck* on Nov. 29, informing the company that
Thailand was planning to import a generic version of its AIDS drug
efavirenz. The drug is sold in the U.S. by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
under the brand name Sustiva. Merck protested, but then dropped its
price. In February it announced it was reducing the price of efavirenz
by 14.5% in poor countries and in some wealthier countries, including
Thailand, that have especially severe AIDS problems.

Merck says that at the current price, 65 cents a day per patient, it
makes no profit. It says it is committed to reaching a negotiated
agreement with the Thai government.

Nonetheless, Thailand pushed ahead with imports of generic efavirenz.
The government recently received 66,000 bottles of a copycat version of
efavirenz made by India's Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. It paid less than
half the price of the brand-name drug prior to the price cut.

Two months after the Merck letter, it was Abbott's turn to receive a
compulsory-license notice, this time about Kaletra. Abbott was supposed
to meet with Thai health ministry officials on Monday, Jan. 29, to
discuss price reductions for Kaletra, but one of Dr. Mongkol's
assistants called a few hours before to cancel the meeting. The minister
had made his decision clear in a letter to Abbott the previous Friday,
so there was nothing to discuss.

Abbott was hoping it could still reach a deal on price that would
preserve its patent. It had faced a similar battle in Brazil in 2005
over Kaletra that ended when Abbott agreed to reduce the price by 46%.
Brazil withdrew its threat to revoke the patent.

In the summer of 2006, Abbott cut the yearly price of Kaletra in some
countries, including Thailand, to $2,200, and it says it was prepared to
make further reductions. The drug costs about $7,000 a year in the U.S.
Senior Abbott executives flew to Bangkok and met Feb. 8 with a Thai team
led by Suwit Wibulpolprasert, special adviser to Dr. Mongkol.

According to Jennifer Smoter, an Abbott spokeswoman, Dr. Suwit told the
company that "regardless of wherever you price this drug, we will
continue the compulsory license." Abbott criticizes this stance, saying
it shows Thailand's contempt for patents and unwillingness to negotiate.

"Some would like to make this an HIV issue, but the fact is, it's not,"
Miles White, Abbott's chief executive, said Sunday in an interview.
"It's clear that this continues to be about compulsory licensing and the
potential for its abuse."

Thai officials, while not commenting directly on the recent discussions
with Abbott, say they tried to get the company's attention for years and
the best way to ensure low prices now is to move ahead with breaking the
patent. Dr. Suwit says it's risky to commit to a fixed-price deal with
drug companies because what looks like a good buy now may become less so
if the cost of the drug in generic form goes down.

The U.S. government has mostly stayed on the sidelines during the
dispute. In a January letter to a congressman who had expressed concern
about the efavirenz move, U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said
Washington isn't accusing Thailand of breaking world-trade rules and has
"taken care to respect fully the Thai government's ability to issue
compulsory licenses" in accordance with WTO obligations.

On Feb. 12, Dr. Mongkol held a news conference in Bangkok and told
reporters that Thailand was considering breaking patents on 11 other
drugs, including treatments for AIDS, infections, cancer and heart
problems. Abbott executives in Chicago heard about the news conference
from an article in an English-language Thai newspaper the following day.

Thai officials quickly backed away, saying that while they reserved the
right to break patents, they didn't have any immediate plans to do so
broadly. Abbott took the newspaper report at face value. "This told us
that price doesn't matter, that this is about busting the patent
system," says Mr. White.

Abbott decided to strike back. It was in the midst of seeking approval
for seven drugs at Thailand's Food and Drug Administration, but it
pulled all seven applications. They included drugs for arthritis, high
blood pressure and other conditions. One of the applications was for
Aluvia, a new version of Kaletra. The active ingredients in the two
drugs are identical, but Aluvia is formulated so that it doesn't need to
be refrigerated. That's a big advantage in Thailand and other developing
countries where many people don't own a refrigerator.

Doctors Without Borders and other activist groups let loose on Abbott,
calling its strategy callous. Paul Cawthorne, Doctors Without Borders'
representative in Bangkok, says: "I think Abbott got some very bad
advice from their PR people."

Together with Mr. Wirat and his group, Doctors Without Borders has been
organizing a consumer boycott of Abbott's existing products in Thailand.
In the U.S., a handful of Abbott investors in faith-based investment
groups also criticized management's decision, saying it could damage the
company's reputation and hurt business prospects in developing countries.

On April 10, Abbott showed signs that it was preparing to back down, at
least partially. After talks with the World Health Organization, Abbott
said it was willing to sell Kaletra to several developing countries,
including Thailand, for $1,000 so long as they kept its patent intact.

Dr. Mongkol and Mr. Wirat were unimpressed. At that point, Abbott was
still refusing to reinstate its application in Thailand to sell Aluvia,
the heat-resistant version of Kaletra. "It's just a business tactic to
make them look better," Mr. Wirat complained in an interview at the time.

Under Abbott's most recent concession, it has offered to reinstate its
Aluvia application and, when approved, sell the drug for $1,000 a year
in Thailand if its patent is respected. However, Abbott continues to
hold back the other six applications. "We are willing to have
discussions to come to a solution, but we have not backed down on"
protecting intellectual property, says Melissa Brotz, a spokeswoman for
the company.

The matter remains unresolved. If Thailand were to accept Abbott's
offer, it would have to undo the compulsory license, which it has shown
no signs of being willing to do.

Cipla Ltd. of India makes a copycat version of Kaletra and is working on
a copy of Aluvia. "Let the multinationals go," says Yusuf Hamied,
Cipla's chairman. "We will supply whatever drugs the Thai or other
governments may want."

PILL PROTECTION

• The Issue: Pharmaceutical giants are running up against hurdles in
emerging markets as some countries threaten to break their patents.

• The Players: Drug makers looking for new markets to boost sales;
developing countries, such as Thailand, trying to keep prices low.

• What's Next: Other countries are following Thailand's example with
AIDS drug Kaletra by moving to open the door to cheaper generics.
