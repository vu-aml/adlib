On Wednesday morning we will be commencing the Due Diligence process with another counterparty.  Andy Zipper has agreed to lead their team through the process.

The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations  and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows:

It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Andy.  

9:00		Introduction			John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen
9:45		Financial Overview		Wes Colwell
10:30		Risk Overview			Buy / Port
11:00		Credit				Bradford

Please make yourselves available - the meetings will probably take place on 32.
