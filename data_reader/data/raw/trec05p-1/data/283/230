Since our OpCo proposal became public, some in the media and others have assumed Enron's new name will be OpCo.  That's a mistake -- OpCo is only a temporary name.  As I've said before, employees should have an opportunity to participate in naming a new company.  And now, here's your chance.

We are just beginning the process to name a corporation that would essentially be an energy asset holding company.  The individual assets within this proposed holding company would not adopt the new name, but continue to use their existing names -- Transwestern Pipeline, Northern Border Partners, Portland General Electric, Elektro, and others.  These names are familiar and reputible within their respective markets.

To submit a name or names for consideration, send an email with your ideas to me at Office of the Chief Executive anytime between now and the end of June.  Over the next few months, we'll be narrowing a list and making a selection.  We will announce the chosen name later in the year once we know the outcome of the OpCo auction process.

I hope you have fun with this and I look forward to seeing your ideas,
Steve Cooper
