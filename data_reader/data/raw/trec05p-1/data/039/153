Louise,

I have looked at this opportunity and am of the opinion that the expense of $7 million will not provide cost effective advertising or dealmaking benefits for Origination particularly or EWS generally.

I will advise M3 Management (the marketing consultant for Team Rahal) that we will not be participating.

Dave
