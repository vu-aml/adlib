getting touchy)

New apps being forwarded this morning that need issuing.

Ultramar Diamond Shamrock $15.0 mil
Astra Energy Canada $3.3 mil
Koch Canada  $800,000

Pending:

Choctaw II Oil and Gas :   $1,0 mill.....we are waiting for the verdict on
this one..but don't hold much hope for getting out of it.   Should know
this morning.

ARE OFFERRING TO PAY FOR THEM BUT WANT A NUMBER
