My Dear
I am Mr IBRAHIM AHMED, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign 
remittance department Bank Of Africa. In my department we discovered an 
abandoned sum of US$14.5M (fourteen million five hundred thousand US 
dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died 
along with his family in November 1999 in a plane crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guide lines and laws but unfortunately we learnt 
that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the 
plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business 
proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation 
to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is 
coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as 
unclaimed bill.

The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclaimed after four years, the money will be transferred into the bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by 
the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as 
next of kin to a foreigner.

I agree that 45% of this money will be for you as respect to the provision 
of a foreign account , 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the 
business and 50% be for me.

Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the 
percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this 
fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or 
next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account
number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective 
communication and location where the money will be transfer.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of 
the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this 
transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear 
as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should 
contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail. Trusting to hear 
from you immediately.

Yours faithfully.

IBRAHIM AHMED,
