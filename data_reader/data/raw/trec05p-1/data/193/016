Hi Guys, 

The bad news is that we did not get a team in the 5 game winter turf season.
Since we have had a team the past two years and they had more teams than
they can accommodate we were put into a drawing with teams similar to us and
our number did not get drawn.  So we'll need to get our soccer some other
way.  Practices anyone?  Also many of us do play indoor at Portland Indoor
on FC TBA so if you are interested show up at the game. The first game of
the next season starts tonight at 10:15 I think the cost is $50 but ask Mike
B. or Ryan if there is still room and what the cost to play is.  For a
schedule go to www.pdxindoorsoccer.com.  As far as the money many of you
already paid, I propose to hold onto it and will use it to pay the Spring
season registration which starts in late April.  Let me know if that is a
problem for you.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.  

Jon

Jon, I am sorry but the Green Room lost in the blind draw. Your check will
be 
returned to you and your team will have an automatic birth next year.
