Just wanted to follow-up on Rob Bakondy to see if there is any interest.  His last day is Friday and Robert Jones, VP HR, ENW has asked for our assistance in checking out any available opportunities before he leaves. 
For your convenience, the resume is attached again below.  If I don't hear back, I'll assume you have no interest in interviewing him.

Thanks,
