Here is some useful information on Anthrax that was sent to Conoco employees
by Conoco's Corporate Security.  Please post or forward as needed.

 
> ANTHRAX INFORMATION FOR EMPLOYEES
> 
> Corporate Security is aware of the media reports of Anthrax mailings and
> everyone's heightened concern of a possible contamination at Conoco.  We
> have maintained contact with the FBI, Hazmat officials and other
> government agencies regarding the investigations about, and the risk of
> contracting Anthrax as a result of receiving a letter.  With the
> heightened concern we all need to become better educated about Anthrax and
> deal with it on a rational level rather than an emotional one.  We have
> evaluated the available information and intelligence and believe the risk
> of an Anthrax exposure at Conoco is low at the present time.
>  
> Most reported instances of letters containing alleged Anthrax and powdery
> substances have proven to be hoaxes.  At this time all of the confirmed
> cases, except one, have been directed at the news media and U. S.
> Government officials.
>  
> Procedures are being furnished Conoco mailrooms regarding screening of
> mail and packages prior to distributions. However, so everyone is educated
> regarding Anthrax and handling pieces of mail, we are furnishing the below
> information:
>  
>  
> FACTS ABOUT ANTHRAX
>  
> Anthrax is a small invisible organism that cannot be seen by the naked
> eye.  To effectively target an individual in a letter, the Anthrax must be
> mixed with a powdery medium and placed in the letter.  It then becomes a
> visible substance resembling a brownish or white powder and will
> immediately settle to the ground.  The Anthrax must be effectively
> dispersed and the victim must be exposed to a relatively large amount of
> Anthrax to become infected.  Fortunately, Anthrax can be washed off with
> soap and water after handling.  Anthrax is not contagious; there is no
> threat of person-to-person transmittal.  If someone is exposed to Anthrax,
> it is treatable with antibiotics.  
>  
> Over 95% of Anthrax cases occur when spores linger on the skin in cuts or
> scratches.  Anthrax cannot penetrate intact skin. Exposure causes lesions
> that initially resemble an insect bite which progresses into a
> fluid-filled blister within a day or two with swelling at the site of the
> infection.  The blister forms a black scab. Twenty percent of the time
> individuals who develop skin lesions may progress onto developing wide
> spread disease which requires immediate treatment.
>  
> The second method of obtaining Anthrax poisoning is through ingestion.
> Gastrointestinal Anthrax is extremely rare in humans and is usually
> contracted when undercooked infected meat is eaten.  The initial signs of
> gastrointestinal Anthrax are nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting and fever.
> This may be followed by abdominal pain, vomiting of blood and severe
> diarrhea.
>  
> The third method is inhalation of Anthrax spores.  The onset of inhalation
> of Anthrax is gradual after a short incubation period, which is usually
> within seven days (in rare cases it is sometimes longer).  The victim may
> initially experience flu like symptoms that start to improve.  This mild
> illness can then progress rapidly to respiratory distress and shock in two
> to four days followed by more severe symptoms that include breathing
> difficulty and exhaustion.
>  If you have had a "Known" exposure you should seek medical care for
> monitoring and potentially for treatment if indicated.  If you have had a
> "possible" exposure and are having symptoms, you should seek medical
> evaluation and treatment through your personal physician.  If you do not
> have a personal physician IHS can help direct you to appropriate care.
> It is difficult to contract inhalation Anthrax by the mere act of opening
> an envelope or package containing a suspected agent or walking through
> settled material.  This would generally not provide the energy required to
> aerosolize the agent.  The FBI has advised that "hundreds" of letters have
> been referred to them because they were suspected of containing Anthrax.
> So far, of all the letters referred to the FBI, very few have contained
> Anthrax.  Most letters implying they contain Anthrax will also contain a
> written or implied threat.  As of this date, there is no evidence that any
> such letters have ever been directed at anyone at Conoco.
>  
> HOW TO HANDLE SUSPECTED ANTHRAX AND OTHER SUSPECTED BIOLOGICAL AGENT
> THREATS
>  
> Many facilities in communities around the country have received Anthrax
> threat letters. Most were empty envelopes; some have contained powdery
> substances most have proved negative for Anthrax. The purpose of these
> guidelines is to recommend procedures for handling letters suspected of
> containing Anthrax.  
>  
> DO NOT PANIC
>  
> 1.	To infect, the organism must be rubbed into abraded skin, swallowed,
> or inhaled as a fine, aerosolized mist. Disease can be prevented after
> exposure to the Anthrax spores by early treatment with the appropriate
> antibiotics. Anthrax is not spread from one person to another person.
> 2.	For Anthrax to be effective as a covert agent, it must be
> aerosolized into very small particles. This is difficult to do, and
> requires a great deal of technical skill and special equipment. If these
> small particles are inhaled, life-threatening lung infection can occur,
> but prompt recognition and treatment are effective.
>  
> SUSPICIOUS UNOPENED LETTER OR PACKAGE MARKED WITH THREATENING
> MESSAGE SUCH AS "ANTHRAX":
>  
> 1.	Do not shake or empty the contents of any suspicious envelope or
> package.
> 2.	PLACE the envelope or package in a plastic bag or some other type of
> container to prevent leakage of contents.
> 3.	If you do not have any container, then COVER the envelope or package
> with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove
> this cover.
> 4.	Then LEAVE the room and CLOSE the door, or section off the area to
> prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away).
> 5.	WASH your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder
> to your face.
> 6.	What to do next...
> *If you are at HOME, then report the incident to local police.
> *If you are at WORK, then report the incident to security or an available

> 7.	LIST all people who were in the room or area when this suspicious
> letter or package was recognized. Give a copy of this list to security,
> the local public health authorities and law enforcement officials for

> ENVELOPE WITH POWDER AND POWDER SPILLS OUT ONTO SURFACE:
>  
> 1.	DO NOT try to CLEAN UP the powder. COVER the spilled contents

> 5.	REMOVE heavily contaminated clothing as soon as possible and place
> in a plastic bag, or some other container that can be sealed. This
> clothing bag should be given to the emergency responders for proper
> handling.
> 6.	SHOWER with soap and water as soon as possible. Do Not Use Bleach Or
> Other Disinfectant On Your Skin.
> 7.	If possible, list all people who were in the room or area,

> 
> Unopened letters/packages with no suspicious markings or indicators:

> 
> Opened letters/packages with material that has spilled out:  
> Law enforcement should follow local response protocols for potential

> 
> 
> Unopened (sealed) letters/packages with suspicious markings or indicators:
