What does the T stand for?  PT...reminds me of the circus, are you really 
that much fun?  My "boy toy" is standing me up tonight, can you believe it?  
Oh...the agony!  Besides the afro, what else have you picked up for your 
costume?  You need to rent some white tuxedo shoes and a white belt to go 
with your orange or light blue, polyester bell bottoms.  (these MUST fit 
quite snug)  Not to mention a very hip large collar disco shirt.  The girls 
will be squealing with delight.

I'm very happy that we will continue to become better friends and I can't 
wait to spend some time with you again.  So incredibley cool that we agree 
on the same ground rules.  I'm sending big wet kisses your way...LOOK OUT! - 
Christina
