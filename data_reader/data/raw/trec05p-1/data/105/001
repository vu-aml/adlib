David, nothing needed on your end at this time by Corporate Risk Management, other then receipt of vehicle information that I requested earlier in the week from Tony.  If this changes, we will let the litigators know, especially Bob Vote who oversees the Nepco matters for the Litigation Unit.  Thanks,

	That being the case, I'd ask that David confirm that he's OK with this course of action and that we (the litigators) don't need to be doing anything in connection with this at this time.

Gail,

Eileen is out of the office today; however, I have confirmed that Rob Cole of Corporate Risk Management is handling this matter directly with the insurance carrier, Travelers.  Risk Management is not, at this time, retaining the Litigation Unit to assist with the claim.  It is my understanding that an acknowledgement letter has been sent in response to the Keiffer letter and Rob Cole is working with NEPCO's safety director, Tony Blair-Softich, to obtain additional necessary information.  

Please let us know if we can be of further assistance.

Eileen,
	I have reviewed the letter and, to the extent that this involves a personal injury/insurance issue, It sounds like it falls  within your area of responsibility.  Please confirm that this is correct and that your group will work with David and the folks at NEPCO to sort out what needs to be done to respond. It may be that the subject coverage is with NEPCO and there won't be much if anything for you to do.
	David, please confirm that you have received the referenced letter, let me know whether you have information about this fellow sufficient to identify the insurance information requested, and also let me know if I can do anything to assist.  
	Thanks.
