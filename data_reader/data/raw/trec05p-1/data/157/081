Hello,

I am senator Abu Hassan in the Federal Republic of Nigeria;
I seek your cooperation and assistance in receiving some
funds on my behalf for investments/partnership on either
real estate, buying stocks/share or any lucrative
investment best known to you in your country, which you
will be in charge. The source of this fund is gratification
from a contractor I have helped to secure contracts and has
nothing or whatsoever to do with our government. 

The money {$15 million} has been deposited with a security
firm abroad. I need the assistance of a reliable and
trustworthy person to help me receive this money, because
as senators we declared our asset according to our
constitution before taking oath of office, and also, we
will be compelled to declare our asset when leaving office.
 And this prompted the Federal Government to setup a
security bureau assigned to monitor all public office
holders. Hence, the need for a foreign partner.

I do not know how business is done
overseas/internationally. But there are many secured ways
of doing this. If you have a more perfect way of doing
this, do let me know, as I am open to suggestion or
proposals. If you are willing to be my partner, then
endeavor to give me your home, office and telephone & fax
Numbers, so that I will be able to get across to you. I
shall provide for you all the documents of the fund deposit
with the security firm to enable you claim and receive this
fund into your bank account.

Consequent on your agreement to assist me, you will receive
20% of the $15 million. As soon as you indicate your
Interest, further details will be discussed on the
procedure that we will follow in accomplishing this deal.

Kindly reach me by email: senator_abuhassan77@yahoo.com.au
                                            

Regards,

Senator.Abu Hassan
