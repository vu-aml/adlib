Just to confirm

	Payment through Wed - 11/14 (with interest) = $14,153,688.78
	Payment through Thur - 11/15 (with interest) = $14,155,586.71

The Settlement Agreement is written based on a Wed payment - if they want to argue for another $1,100 in interest, then we can send it to them in pennies.
