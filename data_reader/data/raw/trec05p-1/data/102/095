Attached are the draft ConfirmLogic documents for Entergy Koch for your review.  Prior to this going to a wider circulation within Enron for comment I would appreciate any comments or suggestions on the structure and format.  There are many definitions in these documents that will need careful review to ensure that the end result is consistent with our practice.  Exhibit A needs to be modified so that the Index name is consistent with what will be input into ConfirmLogic.  There are also some missing variables in certain of the indexes that will need clarification.     

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
Regards,
Brent
