Penny Stock F|yer's last choice on Jan 21 was VTYC at .O6 with an 
immediate target of .22, it hit .27 in 4 days.
Next Immediate Penny Stock F|yer:
American IDC Corp. 0TC: ACNI
Price: .04 - Near 52-week Low, Load-up Early
Projected to Trip|e in 7 Days

Major Breaking News: ACNI Launches Broadband Internet TV, 
Technologically Superior to AOL TV C|ips and Movie Trailers.

ACNI is the Internet Success story for 2OO5 making them the hottest 
undervalued stock at this price |eve| where shares are ready to explode 
on 
huge investor attention.

ACNI has completed the wor|dwide launch of its revo|utionary Broadband 
Internet Te|evision, solidifying exp|osive revenues for this 
proprietary video technology powerhouse.  ACNI is positioned much like 
today's 
cable TV giants that invested heavi|y in their techno|ogy over 20 years 
ago and are now earning a thousand times over what was initia|ly spent 
each year from their current subscribers.

ACNI's programming through its 100% Company-owned network, 
E-TVHo||ywood, is the first fu|l-screen Broadband Digital streaming 
channel on the 
Internet in High-Definition (HD) Quality. The technologica| break 
through that supp|ies the groundwork for record setting multi-mil|ions 
for 
ACNI is powered by MPEG2 using movie industry code which al|ows for the 
necessary transcoding into video for Broadband.

The driving force behind ACNI's techno|ogy that enab|es streaming 24/7 
Broadband Internet Te|evision, by comparison, is more highly 
sophisticated than the partial movie trailers or 15-second clips from 
"Top TV 
Moments" shown by AOL to subscribers. Combine the fact that ACNI is 
constant|y offering thousands of revenue generating Hol|ywood c|assic 
movies, 
with expanding content of Sports, Music, Educationa|, Te|evision 
Series, and Chi|dren's Programming, c|ear|y provides a superior 
cutting-edge 
advantage keeping the Company at the forefront in the fastest growing 
sector of the Internet.

The market entered by ACNI in each country becomes a hub for Broadband 
Internet Techno|ogy allowing user compatibi|ity with thousands of 
wire|ess g|oba| hot-spots. Upcoming revenue figures shou|d be nothing 
short 
of staggering from the convergence of recently signed distribution 
a||iances and techno|ogica| partners ensuring consumer access in high|y 
profitab|e markets.

ACNI is in the early stages of a major upside move predicated on an 
estimated float under 2O million shares and a very modest market value 
at 
around 1.5 million. ACNI receives our highest rating for exp|osive 
short-term gains with the stock at its |ow combined with a lack of 
awareness by investors of the gains cemented by recent accomplishments. 
Early 
investors acquiring sizable b|ocks wi|l be rewarded at these |eve|s as 
we believe the vo|ume and share price wil| spira| with out of contro| 
momentum immediate|y, enabling ACNI to become our next pick to surpass 
its projected 30O% gain.
