As I mentioned in a voice message to you, your current list appears to capture our interests in power generation facilities located in Texas.  We questioned EWS Tax Planning, EWS Accounting, and EWS-Power Originations, to determine if anyone was aware of other Texas power generation projects.  

There are LLC's/LLC structures set up for additional development, but none of them have financials.  The first is Newton Development/Lone Star Development.  It appears this structure was created to acquire land purchase options for Texas power plant development sites, and to develop an electric power facility in Newton County, Texas.  The second is Montague Development, LLC.  It appears that this entity was created to acquire land for and/or develop a coal fired generation facility in Brownsville.  I understand there are approximately 140k of costs accumulated on Enron North America Corp. for Montague, but apparently there are no agreements in place.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
Kurt Eggebrecht
