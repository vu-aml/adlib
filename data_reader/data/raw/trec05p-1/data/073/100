Scott-
Don Miller would like for me to get together with you to discuss several gas storage transactions that have been originated recently (in MI, LA and TX).   I have been meeting with Jean Mrha and Laura Luce and their respective teams, but want to better understand a trading perspective on these assets.   I'm more interested in your macro views than specifics related to each particular project. 

Please let me know a time that works for you (tomorrow or Friday would work best for my schedule).
thanks,
Jeff
