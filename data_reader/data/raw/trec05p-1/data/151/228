Steve,
    I don't have any revenue supporting schedules for Third C.E. or Plan. Could you please provide electronically to Rod monthly detailed volumes and revenues both Firm and Interruptible which tie back to both projections. If you should think of any other supporting documents that could be useful, please provide those also. Once again, thanks for all your help on such a short notice.
                                                                                                              Steve

What do you have to backup the 2001 and 2002 revenue projections for NNG?
