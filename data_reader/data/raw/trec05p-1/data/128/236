> 	The reduction by Moody's Investor Service Inc. of Enron Corp.'s
> senior unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1 this week may be an
> issue of concern for companies that are counterparts to Enron obligations.
> This downgrade may have immediate consequences under existing transactions
> with Enron given that its current credit rating is now two levels above
> non-investment grade.  Any further downgrade into non-investment grade
> levels could seriously affect relationships between counterparties and
> Enron, and possibly Enron counterparties and their counterparties. 
> 
> 	Enron is the principal in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and
> natural gas trades in the United States.  For Enron's power and gas
> trading counterparties, a credit event such as a downgrade by Moody's may
> precipitate certain obligations under the terms of their trading
> transactions.  For example, any downgrade, not just a downgrade resulting
> in a sub-investment grade rating, may entitle a counterparty to require
> Enron to provide additional credit in support of Enron's purchase
> obligations.  Counterparties should examine all power, gas or other
> commodity purchase and sale documentation to confirm whether they possess
> this right.  The failure to exercise this right may constitute a waiver
> and foreclose access to critical performance and payment assurance,
> threatening to alter the risk assessment and mitigation considerations
> upon which the transactions were originally based.  Furthermore, a failure
> to declare a credit event or default against Enron could cause a default
> on the part of the counterparty itself in collateral or ancillary
> arrangements, such as its financing.  The potential for a domino effect,
> causing defaults or credit events in a series of transactions, is
> considerable.
> 
> 	It is uncertain whether Enron's efforts to obtain new lines of
> credit will be sufficient to overcome the current difficulties.
> Regardless, it is prudent to review the terms of existing transactions
> with Enron or its affiliates, including any guarantees or other forms of
> corporate credit support.  It is also advisable to examine the terms of
> transactions dependent on, or otherwise ancillary to, transactions with
> Enron or its affiliates to avoid any consequential effects of the Enron
> credit ratings downgrade.
> 
> 	For further information on how Enron's current financial situation
> could impact your firm's transaction risk profile, please contact Michael
