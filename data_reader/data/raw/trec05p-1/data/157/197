From: Mr. Cheung Pui

Sai Wan Ho Branch

Hong Kong.

Good Day,
Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Cheung Pui
credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have a
concealed business suggestion for you.

Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Fadi Bassem who was a 
business man
made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with
a value of Twenty four millions Five Hundred Thousand United
State Dollars($24.5 million USD) only in my branch. Upon maturity 
several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this
year. Again after the war another notification was sent
and still no response came from him. We later find out that
the General and his family had been killed during the war
in bomb blast that hit their home.

After further investigation it was also discovered that
General. Fadi Bassem did not declare any next of kin in his
official papers including the paper work of his bank
deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at
my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my
bank. So, Twenty four millions Five Hundred Thousand United
State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will
ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that
according to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years
the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong
Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against
this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you
as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to General. Fadi Bassem
so that you will be able to receive his funds.

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:
I want you to know that I have had everything planned out
so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an
attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will
back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Fadi Bassem, all
that is required from you at this stage is for you to
provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the
attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the
next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on
your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of
probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an
account that will be provided by you.

There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are
going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will
prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to
observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this
issue.

Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank
account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for
you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of
this operation. Should you be interested please send me
your full names and current residential address.

Your earliest response to this letter will be
appreciated.and i will prefers you to reach me on this secured
email:cheung147@excite.com

Regards

cheung Pui.
