Please see attached the final drafts of the Enron Capital Trust I and Enron Capital Trust II Forms 12b-25 Notification of Late Filing for the late filing of the 10-Qs for these two entities.  You may be more familiar with these entities known as TOPrS I and TOPrS II (Trust Originated Preferred Securities).  Both of these securities are listed on the NYSE, and both file 10-Qs with the SEC.  Since the obligations for payments under these securities are guaranteed by Enron,  the information in the Enron Corp. 10-Q (which we are filing on Monday) is important to any TOPrS investors----so these two 10-Qs are being filed on the same schedule.  Ray:  I understand that you have succeeded to Ben Glisan's role as Regular Trustee (the person who signs documents on behalf of the Trust---this is essentially an administrative function, since these trusts have no assets or operations or activities).  I don't think anyone will pay much attention to these filings, but they must be filed today.  Please let me know at your earliest convenience if you have any questions.   Thanks, Rex
