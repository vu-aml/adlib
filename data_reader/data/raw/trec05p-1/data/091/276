Latest NFL Player News

Corey Bradford, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective
at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to
prove himself as a Fantasy player.

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions was
good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games
this year and has become a major scoring threat even though he is not very
effective outside of the red zone.

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/21/01
Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving and a
touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, however,
but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench him. 

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona.
Green has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a
starting nod every week. 

Doug Chapman, RB MIN - Team Dick Updated 10/21/01
Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers
were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so
far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot
stay healthy or continues to struggle.

David Boston, WR ARI - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions for 131
yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the league
and is worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/21/01
Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards
of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with
any regularity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 10/21/01
Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for 107
yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to
start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot. 

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/21/01
Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on
Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's
still one of the top Fantasy players in the league. 

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a
score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a
Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/21/01
Griese (shoulder) started Sunday's game against San Diego, but he was
ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions
in Denver's 27-10 loss. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/21/01
Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the
potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not
find the end zone often. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/21/01
The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran
runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.

David Terrell, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Terrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus
Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the
Chicago passing game.

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly
establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears'
featured back for the rest of the year.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/21/01
Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yards and a TD at Detroit. Despite some
quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE,
especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to
Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but
he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/21/01
McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He
completed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate,
possibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/21/01
George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. The lack of a
reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hindered his production
this year. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saints. The
speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect good
numbers from him every week.

Alge Crumpler, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New Orleans.
Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the remainder of the
year.

Albert Connell, WR NO - Uran Man Updated 10/21/01
Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is
definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 10/21/01
Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the
Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality Atlanta defense indicate
Jackson is not capable of providing owners with regularly good numbers.

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/21/01
Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still
making important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is
limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week,
but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh
defense.

Anthony Becht, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards
and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but his
potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a position
lacking quality players. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/21/01
Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed
a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout
should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He
also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile
good numbers against any defense.

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Canidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of
total offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be
short-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk. 

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/21/01
Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, posting six catches for 208 yards and a
score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the
No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot from a
Fantasy perspective. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Banks finally had a somewhat productive game on Sunday, throwing for 346
yards and a score against Carolina. His performance doesn't make him any
more valuable from a Fantasy perspective, however, so don't consider him
any better than a reserve. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/21/01
Muhammad was somewhat limited during Sunday's game against Washington due
to a nagging rib injury. He caught only two passes for 27 yards in the
contest, and may have cost some Fantasy owners a victory this week. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/21/01
Jackson had a surprisingly productive game against Baltimore, rushing for
77 yards and a score. The rookie seems to be all the way back from a
nagging rib injury, and is slowly becoming a good Fantasy player. 

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/21/01
Crowell was carted off the field in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game
with a knee injury. According to published reports, he is likely out for
the season. Larry Foster will probably become Detroit's No. 2 receiver for
the remainder of the year.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/21/01
Harrison had a huge game against New England, posting eight catches for 157
yards and a score. It wasn't enough to win, however, as the Patriots blew
out the Colts, 38-17. 

 Colts, DT IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/21/01
The Colts defense continues to be horrendous, surrending 38 points to Tom
Brady and the New England Patriots on Sunday. At this point, the only
Fantasy value this unit offers is if you have offensive players facing them
in the coming weeks. 

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/21/01
Brown had a huge game against Indianapolis, catching eight passes for 120
yards and a score. He continues to establish himself as a reliable Fantasy
player, and may even better once Terry Glenn returns from a hamstring
injury. 

Eddie Kennison, WR DEN - Dont Mess Updated 10/21/01
Kennison suffered an apparent head/neck injury during the first quarter of
Sunday's game against San Diego. He left the contest but later returned to
action. 

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/21/01
Patten had a record-setting game against Indianapolis on Sunday. The
wideout had four total touchdowns (two receiving, one passing and one
rushing) as the Patriots took out the Colts, 38-17. Patten will likely be
moved to third on the depth chart once Terry Glenn returns, but he's
certainly worth a roster spot at this point. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Banks left Sunday's game against Carolina in the fourth quarter due to a
hand injury. Kent Graham replaced Banks for a play, but he did return. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/21/01
Biakabutuka left Sunday's game against Washington in the fourth quarter
after sustaining a foot injury. He didn't return to the game, and X-rays
later revealed a break. He did put up 150 yards of total offense and a
touchdown before sustaining the injury, but that may have been his last
game of the season. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/21/01
Schroeder will be inactive for Sunday's game at Minnesota. Corey Bradford
is expected to start in his place.

Vinny Testaverde, QB NYJ - Uran Man Updated 10/21/01
Testaverde was replaced by Chad Pennington in the second half of Sunday's
game against St. Louis. The move wasn't injury related, but simply Jets'
coach Herm Edwards giving Pennington some playing time in a blowout game.
Testaverde finished the afternoon 9-of-13 for 74 yards with a touchdown and
an interception. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/21/01
Grbac suffered a chest injury during the second half of Sunday's game
against Cleveland. Randall Cunningham took over for Grbac, who did not
return to the game. Grbac's status for next weekend's game against
Jacksonville is uncertain. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/21/01
Allen left Sunday's game against Cleveland with a calf injury. Jason
Brookins received most of the carries in Allen's absence. 

Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game against Baltimore with an undisclosed injury.
He was replaced by rookie Quincy Morgan. 

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/21/01
Chrebet suffered his second concussion in as many weeks during Sunday's
game against St. Louis. The Jets' wideout did not return to the game and
will be re-evaluated on Monday. 

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Robinson suffered an apparently serious knee injury in the second quarter
of Sunday's game. He was carted off the field and will not return. The
initial diagnosis was a sprain, although the injury appeared to be more
serious.

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/21/01
Bennett has now been listed as inactive for Sunday's game against Green
Bay. Doug Chapman will start at tailback for the Vikings in his absence. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/21/01
Jeffers (knees) has been ruled out of the game against Washington. He has
been practicing recently, and could return to action in the near future,
though.

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/21/01
Richardson (shoulder) will not play this week against the Cardinals. Priest
Holmes will continue to see a full workload as the Chiefs' featured back.

Torrance Small, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
According to published reports, Small has been released by the New England
Patriots. It is the second time this season that the team has cut Small,
who was likely let go due to Terry Glenn's return from a suspension. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 10/21/01
According to the <I>Florida Times-Union</I>, Taylor will miss the Jags'
Oct. 28 contest against Baltimore. Head Coach Tom Coughlin would not offer
up a timetable for Taylor's return, so Fantasy owners must continue to play
the waiting game. 

Doug Chapman, RB MIN - Team Dick Updated 10/21/01
Chapman has officially been named the Vikings' starting tailback for
Sunday's game against Green Bay. He may lose carries in the red zone to
Travis Prentice, but Chapman is still worth starting if you're desperate
for a running back this week. 

Quincy Morgan, WR CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/21/01
Morgan will drop down to the No. 3 receiver on the depth chart this weekend
against Baltimore. Dennis Northcutt is finally healthy and will make the
start, but neither receiver is worth starting from a Fantasy perspective. 

Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
According to published reports, Northcutt will start ahead of rookie Quincy
Morgan on Sunday. Cleveland will be facing a fired up Ravens' defense,
however, so starting any Browns' wideout this week is risky. 

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/21/01
Chrebet (concussion) completed his first full practice of the week on
Friday, according to the <I>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</I>. He's expected to
start against the Rams on Sunday, but he may have trouble facing CB Aeneas
Willliams, so we'd recommend reserving him if possible. 

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
According to the <I>Tampa Tribune</I>, Dunn has missed some practice time
this week due to his sprained foot. He is expected to start on Sunday
against Pittsburgh, however, so Fantasy owners should have no hesitation in
starting him this week. 

Corey Bradford, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Bradford is expected to start in place of the injured Bill Schroeder on
Sunday against Minnesota. He's worth taking a chance on in deeper leagues,
but don't expect him to post Schroeder-like numbers. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/21/01
Schroeder (ankle) has been downgraded to questionable for Sunday's game
against Minnesota. He'll almost certainly be replaced by Corey Bradford in
the starting lineup, so starting him from a Fantasy perspective is a risky
move. 

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Wilkins (ribs) is out for Sunday's game against New England, and may be
lost until November 4. With Jerome Pathon ailing as well, rookie Reggie
Wayne will be the No. 2 receiver for the Colts. 

Jermaine Lewis, WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
According to the <I>Baltimore Sun</I>, Lewis (hamstring) has not been 100
percent healthy this season. He's expected to play on Sunday against
Cleveland, however, but he's not worth starting outside of deeper Fantasy
leagues. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Heap (ankle) practiced on Friday and is expected to play on Sunday against
Cleveland. He's worth starting in deeper leagues, but the presence of
Shannon Sharpe will keep him from being productive on a consistent basis. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/21/01
Mason (ankle) is expected to start on Sunday against Detroit. With the
Lions' secondary in shambles, starting Mason is a good decision for Fantasy
owners with a thin group of receivers. 

Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Kinney is dealing with a slight calf strain, but he's expected to play on
Sunday against Detroit. With Frank Wycheck in the picture, it's tough to
depend on Kinney to produce consistently, so benching him is advisable. 

Rob Moore, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Moore (hamstring) missed practice on Friday and has been downgraded to out
for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Keep him on reserve if he's
currently on your roster

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/21/01
Griese (shoulder) will start Sunday's game against the San Diego Chargers.
He has practiced with the first team offense all week, and seemed to have
no problems mechanically. These AFC West games tend to be high scoring, so
starting Griese is advisable. 

 Lions, DT DET - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Defensive back Bryant Westbrook has been listed as out for Sunday's game
against Tennessee. This could mean big things for Steve McNair and the
Titans' passing game, who should have an easy time beating Detroit's
corners on a regular basis. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/21/01
According to published reports, Glenn has been declared inactive for
Sunday's game against Indianapolis. Glenn is dealing with a hamstring
injury that he sustained last week, and he is not yet 100 percent. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
According to the <I>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</I>, Faulk has been ruled out
for Sunday's game against the New York Jets. Faulk missed his third
straight practice on Friday, so the team will go with Trung Canidate as the
featured back. 

Mike Alstott, RB TB - Luccis Losers Updated 10/19/01
Don't expect much from Alstott this week. Warrick Dunn is healthy enough to
start again, and will be the featured back against Pittsburgh.

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 10/19/01
Morton could have a big game this weekend against Tennessee. The Titans'
secondary has been shaky at best, so the positive matchup makes Morton a
good start from a Fantasy perspective. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/19/01
Stewart will have a hard time racking up good Fantasy stats Sunday against
a Tennessee linebacking corps that can cover a lot of ground. Start him
only if you don't have two other backs on your team with better matchups.

Byron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 10/19/01
Chamberlain is definitely a good start this week. He will become a major
factor if the Packers focus too much on Minnesota's wide receivers.

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/19/01
Booker would make an excellent Fantasy starter in his game Sunday against
the Bengals. Cincinnati is without cornerback Rodney Heath, which will make
it difficult to defend Booker this week.

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/19/01
Expect good numbers from Carter this week. He is a big-game player who will
not be flustered by the improved Green Bay defense.

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/19/01
Robinson battled a back injury in Week Five, but he should rebound on
Sunday against Cincinnati. The Bears will need to make some deep passes and
we think Robinson would make a solid Fantasy starter this week.

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Green Bay's defense has played well so far, but Culpepper won't be
intimidated by the Packers. He has faced them many times before, and should
fare well in an important divisional game in front of the home crowd.

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Miller will need to throw the deep ball often Sunday against the
overaggressive Bengals. He should post adequate Fantasy numbers, making him
a solid starter if you don't have any other superstar QBs to choose from.

Ahman Green, RB GB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/19/01
Green will get the bulk of his numbers in the second half if Green Bay can
get ahead of Minnesota early. He will definitely be good for at least one
TD.

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/19/01
Favre should have another excellent game this week. Minnesota's secondary
will not be able to handle him, especially with CB Robert Tate ailing.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/19/01
Dunn sat out practice Thursday with a sprained right big toe, but is
expected to play Sunday against Pittsburgh. He faces a tough challenge in
the Steelers' stingy rush defense, so consider reserving him if you have a
more established back on your roster.

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Schroeder missed practice for a second straight day Thursday due to an
ankle injury. However, he is listed as probable on the injury report, and
you should probably start him this week unless he takes a turn for the
worse before gametime.

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/19/01
Moss practiced Thursday for the first time since aggravating an ankle
injury on Sunday, and has been upgraded from questionable to probable on
the injury report for Sunday's game against Green Bay. You should
definitely get him into your active Fantasy lineup as a result.

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Matthews could serve as the backup quarterback for the Bears Sunday in
Cincinnati after throwing in drills Thursday. Don't bother with him, as
he's not going to get much playing time the rest of the season behind Jim
Miller on the depth chart.

Fred Baxter, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Baxter practiced Thursday and hopes to be able to play Sunday in
Cincinnati, according to the <I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>. He has been
recovering from a neck injury, but isn't worth your Fantasy attention.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/19/01
Griese (shoulder) practiced with the first-team offense, and looked good,
Mike Shanahan told the <I>Denver Post</i>. He is expected to start against
San Diego. "I think he did pretty good," coach Mike Shanahan said. "He
practiced the whole practice. It didn't look like there was anything wrong.
I'm not sure how painful it is because I haven't talked to him, but so far,
so good." 

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Wilkins (ribs) is not expected to play against the Patriots. He is listed
as doubtful.

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/19/01
The effects of a concussion suffered against Miami has kept Chrebet out of
practices this week. He is expected to play against St. Louis.

J.R. Redmond, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/19/01
Redmond (ankle) is expected to be in uniform for Sunday's game. But it
appears he will not be used much, because New England has found Antowain
Smith to be a dependable back.

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Clark should get open often against San Diego. The Chargers' pass defense
can definitely be exploited over the middle.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 10/19/01
Smith should have another fine game this week. He will be the focal point
of the Denver passing game in a contest that will feature a lot of offense.

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/19/01
Anderson may find it difficult to reach 100 yards against the Chargers. San
Diego has a strong front seven, and the Broncos are having trouble with
blocking on end runs.

Freddie Jones, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Jones has been a disappointment so far, but he could be a factor this week,
as the Chargers trade blows with the Broncos in a high-scoring game.

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 10/19/01
Graham should produce good numbers this week. The Chargers will probably
engage in a high-scoring game with the Broncos.

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Gonzalez will be a prime target against the Cardinals. Kansas City will
certainly see many passing openings over the middle. 

Chris Thomas, WR KC - Uran Man Updated 10/19/01
Thomas has moved into Kansas City's starting lineup. Don't use him unless
you are desperate for help at receiver.

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/19/01
The matchup suggests Alexander will do well this week, but the Chiefs will
probably look to keep the ball on the ground, limiting Kansas City's
passing numbers.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Don't expect Wycheck to catch a lot of passes this weekend. He hasn't been
featured too heavily in the Titans' passing game and has been used more to
block for running back Eddie George. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/19/01
Mason is suffering from an ankle injury and is listed as questionable for
this week's game against the Lions. Tennessee expects him to play but don't
rely on him being too productive. The injury caused him to miss last week's
game.
