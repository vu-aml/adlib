Thought I would check back with you to see if you have had time to address the issue (below) I had forwarded you on the 8th of this month.  I am trying to tie up loose ends on as many open name change issues as I can before I go on vacation.  Currently I am in need of copies of the Secretary of State certificates for the merger and the concurrent name change.  Belco Oil & Gas Corp has quite a bit of exposure and is on Credit Watch; with this in mind I would like to clean this merger up in the database as soon as possible. As I mentioned below, Mr Boigon will only speak to someone from our Legal Department since he feels he has sent ample documentation already.  

Please feel free to forward me a name and number if you would prefer I re-direct this inquiry.

Sincerely,

Good afternoon, I work with Cheryl Johnson in Global Counterparty doing name changes, acquisitions, and mergers and have run into a minor setback with one of the counterparties:

I received a lead from one of my co-workers that a merger and concurrent name change had occurred involving the above referenced entities.  To follow up on the lead I spoke to Howard Boigon at 303-575-0143, and I requested documentation in the form of copies of Secretary of State documents relevant to the changes.  Mr. Boigon informed me that he had forwarded a DPL Notice to you with a "complete package" detailing the transaction.  He refuses to send anything further until I get with you and find out if what he sent is sufficient; if it is not he has requested that someone from legal call him and explain what we need and why.

Could you please follow up with me on this issue...don't you just love Mondays?!
