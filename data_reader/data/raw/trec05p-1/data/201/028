FROM:The Desk of JAMES OTTOR,
Bill And Exchange Manager,(A.D.B)
(African Development Bank)
Republic of Benin.
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVATE

Dear Friend,

Compliments of the day. I deceided to contact you after I received a wort=
hy
information about your reliability and honesty. Hence I confide in you.

I am Mr JAMES OTTOR.from (African Development Bank),Republic of Benin.Dur=
ing
the course of our auditing we discovered the sum of twelve million five
hundred thousand united states dollars (USD$12.500.000.00) floating in an=

account opened in this Bank since 1997 and as from 2001 nobody has operat=
ed
on this account again, and after going through some old files in the reco=
rds
I discovered that the owner of the account died without a [HEIR]sept 11th=

2001 by plane crash, hence the money is floating. 

After due verification I noticed that no other person knows about this ac=
count
except his wife who was also invovled in the crash, and the account has
no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that until=

his death he was the Director GOLD ARK [SARL]Since our bank,(African Deve=
lopment
Bank)Benin Rep.got information about his death, we have been expecting hi=
s
next of kin to come forward and claim his money because we cannot release=

it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the decea=
sed
as indicated in our banking guidelines and policies but up to date nobody=

came up to this bank as his next of kin or relative.
 
It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials
in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and
release the money to you as the next of kin or elation to the deceased fo=
r
safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming forth and we do=
n't
want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.
On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the ne=
xt
of kin as no one has come up as his relation. And the country law here do=
es
not allow such money to stay more than Five years, for the money will be
recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this period.

Upon the receipt of your response, I will send to you the application for=
m,bank'scontact
and the next step to take. I will not fail to bring to your notice that
this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as=

all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within fourteen banking=

days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the deceased. It has
been resolved that 20% will be for you while 10% has been maped out to de=
fray
any expences that might be incured during the process of the ransaction.
Then 70% will be for me which shall be release after the funds must have
been remitted into your bank account.

When you receive this letter, kindly send me an e-mail signifying your de=
cision.Including
your private Tel/Fax numbers for quick communication. I will be very happ=
y
if you can treat this business with the utmost secrecy it demands because=

of my position in this bank.
Hoping for a very successful business relationship with you.

Best Regards,
Mr JAMES OTTOR.
