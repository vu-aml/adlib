We traded on several exchanges including Nymex, CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange), CBOT (Chicago Board of Trade), ME (Montreal Exchange), IPE (Int'l Petroleum Exch.), and OMLX (The London Securities and Derivatives Exchange).  

Thanks,
Todd

Thanks.

What exchanges do these entries reflect (e.g., NYMEX only?)?

Here's the file showing which brokers owe us cash as of close of business 1/24/02.  Look at the "0124" tab and under the "Wire Day Cash In/Out" column.  The $95.6MM represents the amount each of these brokers owes to us (We owe HSBC $2,132).  Also, I sent figures to Steve Van Hooser and Mark Taylor on 12/5/01 for the exchange amounts that were due as of 11/30 and 12/4 for $58.4MM and $87.3MM respectively.  Currently all of our exchange positions are closed.
