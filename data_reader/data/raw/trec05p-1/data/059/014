Dear Ken,

	With everything that has happened in the past few weeks, I think we all realize how dangerous this world truly can be.  As an employee, I appreciate the security measures that Enron has implemented over the years; however, I think the events of September 11th show that maybe we haven't gone far enough.  Although we could do little about a suicide attack from the air, there are many other types of attack we could prevent or minimize.  The Houston Police Officers, around the buildings and on regular patrol, provide good basic protection.  However, in the event of a city-wide attack, the Police  would be unavailable and we would have to take some type of action ourselves.  The Security firm contracted for the building lacks the training to respond to life and death situations.  I would recommend, and volunteer for, a security team comprised of Enron employees with prior military or police service.  There may come a time, God forbid, when we just have a few moments to act and the police may not be available.  If we can't defend ourselves in the first few minutes of an act, it could be too late.  I served in an anti-terrorist unit in the U.S. Army and have a few ideas that I think could help.  If this is in the realm of possibility, I would be happy to discuss this with whomever you designate.  I do feel safe here at work but planning for the worst, before it happens, seems very prudent in these times.  Thanks!
