Sara,

Mark Russell of Salt River Project sent me their ISDA documents last week.  Can we take a look at them and make the changes we would like to incorporate?  He called this morning and they are considering financial transactions with us.  Please give me a call and let me know where we stand with this when you get a chance.  If I should send it on to some one else.  Please let me know that as well.

Thanks,

Kim

I would like to begin working on an ISDA, I have attached our standard form
schedule and CSA for your review.  I think this is a good window of
opportunity.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

I have been trying to get an ISDA going with Enron for several months. Who
is the best contact to call?

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward
