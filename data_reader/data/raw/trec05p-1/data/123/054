Dear Friend,

This mail may not be surprising to you if you have  been following current  
events in the international media with reference to the Middle
East and Palestine in particular. I am Mrs. SUHA ARAFAT, the wife of YASSER 
ARAFAT, the Palestinian leader who died recently in Paris.Since his death 
and even prior to the announcement, I have been thrown into a state of 
antagonism, confusion, humiliation, frustration and hopelessness by the 
present leadership of the Palestinian Liberation  Organization and the new 
Prime  Minister. I have even been subjected to physical and psychological 
torture.  As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost  confidence with 
everybody in the country at the moment. You must have heard the media 
reports and  the Internet on the discovery of some fund in my  husband 
secret bank account  and companies and the allegations of some huge sums  of 
money deposited by my  husband
in my name of which I have refused to disclose or give up to the  corrupt 
Palestine Government. In fact the total sum  allegedly
discovered by  the Government so far is in the tune of about $6.5  Billion 
Dollars. And they are not relenting on their effort to make me poor for 
life. As you know,  hence my  desire for a
foreign  assistance. I have deposited the sum of 20 million  dollars with a 
security  firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we  open 
communication. I  shall be grateful if you could receive this fund
into your bank account for   safe keeping and any Investment opportunity. 
This  arrangement is known to you and my personal Attorney. He might be 
dealing  with you directly for  security
reasons as the case may be. In view of the above, if you are  willing to 
assist for our mutual benefits, we will  have to negotiate on your  
Percentage share of the $20,000,000 that will be kept in your position for a 
  while and invested in your name for my trust pending  when my
Daughter,Zahwa will come of age and take full responsibility of her Family 
Estate/inheritance. Please note that this is a golden opportunity that comes 
  once in life time and more so, if you are hornet, I  am going to entrust 
more  funds in your care as this is one of the legacy we keep for our 
children. In  case you don't accept please do not let me out to  the 
security and  international media as I am giving you this information in 
total trust and confidence I will greatly appreciate if you accept  my 
proposal in good  faith. Please expediate action.
Please kindly reply to my private email address
(arafatsu@myway.com)
Yours sincerely,
Mrs.Suha Arafat
