GPCM Version 9.0.8.3 Now Available
 
An enhanced version of the GPCM User Interface is now available to GPCM
licensees.  This version has three improvements over version 9.0.8.2:
*	Improved Check Routine:  now finds instances where Min_Flow is
greater than Max_Flow in any input table
*	Storage_Status table no longer needed:  all storage related
information is now contained in Storage_Data, Storage_Plan, and
Storage_Link.  There is no longer a necessity to maintain compatibility
between Storage_Status and Storage_Plan
*	Send E-Mail on run completion:  a new option:  when GPCM has
finished a run (even as part of a batch), an e-mail is sent to the
e-mail address you specify
 
Enhancements in 9.0.8, 9.0.8.1 and 9.0.8.2 released earlier included:
*	Build New Pipeline Models and Model Changes More Easily
*	Greater Flexibility in Creating New Supply and Demand Scenarios
*	Major Upgrade to Flow Constraints Report
*	Enhancements in Supply and Demand Summary reports
*	Enhancements in Supplier Delivery and Customer Receipts Summary
reports
*	Storage Utilization Report modified to work with input
capacities expressed in mmcf per day
