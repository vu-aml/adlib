Hey Kevin- thanks for the intro at the Fundy meeting on Friday- would like to sit down with you to talk priorities this week if you have time.  

For Power East, I know you want maximum bang for your buck across a limited number of projects, so I'm thinking:

1. New Gen
2. Hydro Quebec reservoir levels
3. Oil "shock"/terrorism
4. Coal- utility stockpiles

Thanks,

Robert Johnston
