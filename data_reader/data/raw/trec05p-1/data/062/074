In addition to mowing lawns, Jim Rolewicz is a landscaper.  He's worked for several people I know, including one EMCA resident.  In addition, as his customers occasionally ask if he can do other tasks for them, he has learned more skills and is now the only handyman whose name I give out to my wallpaper customers.  I always describe him this way: ... A great guy, about 30something, who there's a little too much of...too cheerful, too loud, too vivacious, to enthusiastic.  Lives in the Heights.

I'm in search of someone to mow my lawn.  My lawnmower bit the dust and I really don't have time in the first place.  Any connections?
 
Thanks,
