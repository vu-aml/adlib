Current Facts:

Mary Grisaffi verified internally that the invoice associated with the Performance Bond in question has not been paid.
Mary Grisaffi and Martin O'Leary will double check with the Performance Bond issuance company to make sure that the invoice has not been paid.
Rogers Herndon has approved the payment, via the online IBUYIT system, so the payment is in the pipeline for payment.
Rogers Herndon has indicated that items of this nature in the future should be approved by the New Market Approval Team (Jim Wood et. al).
Gloria Ogenyi has been notified of all of the pertinent information surrounding the Performance Bond in question.

If you have any questions, please contact me at 713.853.3561.

Gloria -

Could you please help us gather the facts on what the $12 MM Surety Bond currently being requested (#6131506) is for - is this PG&E?.  Mary informed me that funds ($36,000) may not be available, is this correct?  

It is my understanding that Credit, Services and Regulatory will be monitoring and processing bond requirements.  As such, I would like to know how this would impact EES' business and definitely want to be aware of any default situation prior to reading about it in the press.  

Thanks, 
Rogers
