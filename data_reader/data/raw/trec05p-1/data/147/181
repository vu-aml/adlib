Holiday Travel Tips 

We look forward to providing you the best holiday travel experience possible.  We've collected some travel tips to add convenience and save you time as you prepare for your departure.  Tips include:

* Avoid wrapping gifts prior to travel to avoid delays at security checkpoints. 
* You now have to show your government-issued photo ID at the security checkpoint and before boarding, so please have your photo ID ready at all times. 
* American now boards passengers by group number.  Check your boarding pass and board with your group number.

Flight Status Information - Delivered To You 

Making a list?  Checking it twice?  Whether taking off or picking up someone, one thing you can check off your list is finding out the status of any American Airlines or American Eagle flight.  Once you sign up for Flight Status Notification, we'll notify you of flight arrival or departure times, as well as gate and baggage information - no matter where you are. You choose when and how you want to be notified, whether it's a voice message to any type of phone, or a text message to a cell phone, alphanumeric pager, wireless personal digital assistant (PDA), or a regular email account. To register, simply visit www.aa.com/notify or click the link.
