<body>How to Turn $25 into $15,000 in 90 Days with PayPal <br><br>

This is the CHEAPEST, FASTEST and EASIEST way to make <br>
serious money online - PERIOD! <br><br>

There are a lot of companies out there offering to put you in your own <br>
business, but I'm so certain you will make a SERIOUS INCOME with what I
<br>
am going to tell you that I'm willing to roll up my sleeves and help<br> 
you begin - RIGHT NOW!! <br><br>

***************************************************************************
**<br>
You have most likely seen or heard about this project on TV programs <br>
such as 20/20 and Oprah Winfrey, or you may have read about it in the <br>
Wall Street Journal. If not, here it is below - revealed to you in <br>
step-by-step detail. This program is by no means new. It has been in <br>
existence in many forms for at least a decade. But in the early days,<br> 
it required a lot more time and effort, as well as an outlay of a few <br>
hundred Dollars. However, thanks to PayPal and the Internet, the outlay
<br>
is now virtually ZERO! And what's more, the entire process is FASTER, <br>
EASIER, and MORE LUCRATIVE than it has EVER been! <br><br>

If you're already running a home business, you can easily do this one <br>
along with it. If not, this is the FASTEST and EASIEST way to earn <br>
serious money online that you've ever seen so far in the history of the
<br>
Internet! This program works no matter what country you are in, or what
<br>
currency you use. It doesn't matter how old or how young you are. And <br>
you certainly won't need any special knowledge or talent. You won't <br>
need to run a website, or make phone calls, or make photocopies, or <br>
send out letters through the mail, or pay for advertising, etc. The <br>
only things you will need are:<br>
<br>

An email address <br>
A PayPal account with at least $25 deposited in it <br>
Just 30 minutes of your time <br><br>

All you need is a PayPal account and an email address! <br><br>

Just about everyone has heard about "PayPal" (if you haven't you will<br> 
soon!) and when I came across this concept I knew it would work <br>
because, as a member of PayPal (an Ebay company), I had already<br> 
experienced their efficiency and excellent standing. PayPal is the <br>
simplest method of making and receiving payments online that anyone has
<br>
ever seen! Anyone with an email address can join for FREE! Once you <br>
have a PayPal account, you can send and receive credit card payments to
<br>
or from anyone - anywhere in the world! Please read further before you <br>
go there... You can complete this whole process within just half an <br>
hour and you will NEVER forget the day you decided to do so!!! <br><br>

Let's get started, just follow the instructions exactly as set out<br> 
below and then prepare yourself for a HUGE influx of cash over the next
<br>
90 days! <br><br>
********************************************<br><br>

Here's what you need to do. . . <br><br>

STEP 1 <br><br>

Ok, if you're not already a PayPal user, the very first thing you need <br>
to do is click on the PayPal link below and SIGN UP. It takes just 2 <br>
minutes! <br><br>

Here's the link: <br><br>
<a href="https://www.paypal.com/row/mrb/pal=YLTG4PCUD79AW%20">https://www.p
aypal.com/row/mrb/pal=YLTG4PCUD79AW 
</a><br>
<br>

Please be sure to sign up for a free PERSONAL ACCOUNT (then upgrade to <br>
a free Premier Account) so that you can receive credit card payments <br>
from other people.<br>
*********************************************** <br><br>

STEP 2 <br><br>

It is an undeniable law of the universe that we must first give in <br>
order to receive. So the first thing to do when you have your Premier <br>
PayPal account is to IMMEDIATELY send a $5 payment from your PayPal <br>
account to  EACH email address in the list below, along with a note <br>
saying:<br><br>

"Please add me to your mailing list." <br><br>

Be certain to add this note, as this is what KEEPS THIS PROGRAM LEGAL. <br>
In order to be completely legal, you must actually sell something in <br>
order to receive a dollar in return. So when you send  $5 to  EACH <br>
email address on the list, you must include these words, "PLEASE ADD ME
<br>
TO YOUR MAILING LIST" and include your name and your email address. <br>
This is the key to the program. <br><br>

Instructions on how to send a payment are under "SEND MONEY" at the <br>
Paypal site. It's so easy!! At the bottom of the SEND MONEY page,<br> 
there should be an optional NOTE field this is where "Please add me to <br>
your mailing list." should put in. <br><br>

When you send your $5 payment to each email addresses in the list, do it
<br>
with a great big smile on your face because "as you sow, so shall you <br>
reap!" <br>
****************************************************<br><br>

Here's the current list: <br><br>

1. Sarah Cumming<br>
    TeOnly1@gmail.com<br>
******************** <br><br>

2. Ashley Beach<br>
    miss_ashes_beach@paradise.net.nz<br><br>

3. Greg Lomas<br>

4. Lisa Jenkins<br>

********************<br><br>
     
5. Teo Baku<br>
    tpbj234@yahoo.com<br>
********************<br><br>

After you have transferred a $5 payment to each of  the email addresses<br>
on the list, something very eerie happens. It gives you an <br>
indescribable, overwhelming sense of certainty, belief and conviction <br>
in the system. You've just proved to yourself that, because you have <br>
done it, there must be a great number of other people ready to do <br>
exactly the same. Thus you have now seen for yourself, first hand, that
<br>
this business actually works! <br>
****************************************************<br><br>

STEP 3 <br><br>

Once you've sent a $5 payment to each of the addresses <br>
(along with your note - this is VERY important!, the next thing you <br>
need to do is to obtain a copy of the contents of this page, as you'll <br>
be sending it out (as an email message or by advertising your page, <br>
like I have done) to at least 40 people (keep in mind that 40 is a good
<br>
number of people to reach, but with all the different ways of <br>
advertising for free on the internet the amount of views and sign-ups<br> 
under you could well exceed into the hundreds or thousands if you<br> 
wish....the more people who join the more profitable for everyone on <br>
the list, including you). The copy that you will send out will contain <br>
YOUR email address at number 5 in the list - having deleted the address
<br>
at Number 1 in the list, and moving the others up a position. <br><br>

The best way to do this is you can copy and paste into emails to your <br>
family and friends. You can copy and paste it and put ad's on the <br>
internet on message boards etc. Or you can create your own free <br>
website, by copying and pasting. There are many free WebPages you can <br>
build on the web. For example 2 good ones are <a
href="http://wwwgeocities.com">www.geocities.com</a> 
or <br>
<a href="http://www.cmlb.net">http://www.cmlb.net</a>. Both of these are
simple 
to use. And the best part <br>
of having this info on a website for people to follow is you can post <br>
links to your site on paid to click websites or paid to read email <br>
sites, for great advertising. There are countless ways to get more <br>
people like me and you involved in this amazing program.<br><br>
**************************************************** <br><br>

A. Go to the toolbar at the top of the window and select "Edit" and
<br><br>
then " Select All". 

B. Go to the toolbar again and select "Edit" and then "Copy ". <br><br>

C. Start (compose) a new email message (PLAIN TEXT so everyone can view
<br>
it!). <br>

D. Fill in your email address and subject line, and then click in the <br>
main message area. <br><br>

E. Go to "Edit" and "Paste" to paste the text into your new email <br>
message. Now you can edit and format the message text in any way you<br> 
want! However, it's best to just leave the text as it is because you <br>
want your email to be read by everyone who receives it! <br>

The only thing you need to make sure of is that YOUR email address is <br>
at Number 5 in the list in STEP 2. Of course, the address that was <br>
previously at Number 1 should have been removed, and the other email <br>
addresses should have been moved up a position to accommodate yours at <br>
Number 5. As long as you have done this correctly, your email is ready <br>
for sending! <br><br>


F. Once you've got your email message ready, send out a minimum of 40 <br>
copies of the email - but only to people you know, or to people who <br>
respond to MLM offers, or to people who've sent YOU offers. By sending <br>
this letter and the payment via EMAIL, the response time is EXTREMELY <br>
fast.......... ELECTRONIC TRANSFER INTERNET FAST!!! That's why it takes
<br>
only a few days for those $5 payments to start flooding into your <br>
PayPal account! <br><br>

THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT! The whole process should take you about 30 <br>
minutes to complete. <br><br>

BE PREPARED TO GET EXCITED.... YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Half an <br>
hour of easy work is all that's needed - no capital outlay, no postage <br>
stamps, no printing, copying or waiting, and the concept is 100% legal.
<br><br>

Within 90 days, over $15,000 cash will pass through your PayPal <br>
account. And that's GUARANTEED. In fact, you can expect to receive a <br>
substantial number of $5 payments within the first few days! Keep a <br>
copy of your email safe so that you can use it again whenever you need <br>
more cash! <br><br>

Here's the math : <br><br>

When you send out your emails, your email address will initially be at <br>
Number 5 in the list. That's the best position it can be in at this <br>
stage if you want to make serious money. The response-rate for this <br>
program is much higher than any typical email marketing campaign for a <br>
number of reasons, which are explained later. As long as you send your <br>
emails to people who are likely to be interested in this program, on <br>
average, you can expect a response from about 25% of the people you <br>
send to. But let's be extremely conservative here and assume that you <br>
receive an average response rate of only 12.5%. . . <br><br>

If you send out your email to 40 different people, you can expect at <br>
least 5 of those people to do exactly what you did ( 12.5% of 40 = 5).<br> 
By this time, your email address will have moved up to Number 4 in the<br> 
list, and this list will now have reached around 200 people (5 x 40).<br>
<br>

Out of those 200 people, you can expect at least 25 of them to <br>
participate ( 12.5% of 200 = 25), so that's a further 1,000 emails ( 25 x
<br>
40) being sent out and your email address will have risen to Number 3 <br>
in the list. <br><br>

Out of those 1,000 people, you can expect at least 125 of them to <br>
participate (12.5% of 1,000 = 125), so that's a further 5,000 emails <br>
(125 x 40) being sent out with you now at the Number 2 position. <br><br>

Out of those 5,000 people, you can expect at least 625 of them to <br>
respond ( 12.5% of 5,000 = 625), so that's 25,000 emails ( 625 x 40) <br>
being sent out with YOUR ADDRESS at the Number 1 spot! <br>

Now, out of those 25,000 people, you can expect around 3,125 of them to
<br>
respond ( 12.5% of 25,000 = 3,125). And since you will now be at NUMBER
<br>
1 in the list, you will receive: <br><br>

$15,625 ! (3,125 x $5) <br><br>

That's all you need to do! There will be around $15,000 in $5 payments <br>
waiting for you in your PayPal account within the next few weeks. <br>
$15,000 for just 30 minutes work! This is real money that you can spend
<br>
on anything you wish! Just deposit it to your own bank account or spend
<br>
it directly from your PayPal account!!! It's just that easy!!! I think <br>
it's WORTH IT, don't you? <br><br>

Remember, the 12.5% example above is assuming that 35 out of the 40 <br>
people you send your email to will do absolutely nothing except delete <br>
your email. However, if you follow the plan correctly and send your <br>
emails only to people who are likely to want to participate, you can <br>
expect a typical response-rate of around 25% . Hence, the 12.5% example
<br>
is only given as a worst-case-scenario. Additionally, the above example
<br>
assumes that each participant will only send out 40 emails. Imagine <br>
what would happen if each participant sent out 1,000 emails instead of<br> 
just 40! Believe me, many people will do this and much more! <br><br>

Consider this! Millions of people surf the Internet every single day, <br>
all over the world! Plus there are 50,000 new people who get on the <br>
Internet every month! The people who send you offers by email can <br>
provide you with an excellent source of bulk email addresses to send <br>
to. You can also send out emails to all of your family, friends, and to
<br>
anyone who you think would want to invest $25 and 30 minutes of their <br>
time to make a substantial lump sum within a month. If you want to <br>
operate this business continuously, you should consider obtaining bulk <br>
lists of email addresses from a reputable mailing list company. That's <br>
how I've managed to stay in business for the last 2 years! If you <br>
already have a legitimate mailing list, then this program would be the <br>
most profitable way to make use of it. There are many websites that <br>
sell thousands of fresh opt-in email addresses of people who have <br>
subscribed to receive exactly this type of program. For example, visit:
<br>
<a href="http://www.htmail.com">www.htmail.com</a> and <a
href="http://www.email2success.com">www.Email2Success.com</a>. 
Or try free advertising <br>
opportunities like: <a href="http://www.nomorehits.com">Nomorehits.com</a>
and 
<a href="http://www.bannermatrix.com">BannerMatrix.com</a>. The <br>
possibilities are endless, and it's so easy! <br><br>

Unlike many other programs, this 5-LEVEL PROGRAM costs you only $25. <br>
That's right, only $25 ONCE, which is much more realistic and provides <br>
much, much faster results. . No cheating can occur (don't <br>
be fooled by claims that this system can be cheated) as Paypal only <br>
allows one account per person. Because it is so easy, the response rate
<br>
is VERY HIGH and VERY FAST - Internet email FAST, and you will start <br>
seeing dramatic results in less than one week! JUST IN TIME FOR NEXT <br>
MONTH'S BILLS! <br><br>

Remember, you need only mail out 40 copies to start with. This will be <br>
enough to generate a substantial lump sum within 90 days. For example, <br>
send to personal contacts and reply to people who send their programs <br>
to you, as they are already working on the web. They know these <br>
programs work and they are already believers in the system! This is NOT
<br>
considered SPAM if you are responding to other people's offers, or <br>
sending to friends, family and contacts, or if you are using a <br>
legitimate mailing list. <br><br>

So, email your letters out today, and then prepare yourself for a huge <br>
influx of cash within the next 90 days!!! <br><br>

4 factors that make this program so successful. . . <br><br>

EXTREMELY FAST RESPONSE <br><br>

EXTREMELY HIGH RESPONSE <br><br>

RATE UNLIMITED PROFIT POTENTIAL <br><br>

QUICK, SIMPLE AND CHEAP TO GET STARTED <br><br>

Because of the VIRTUALLY ZERO INVESTMENT, SPEED, and HIGH PROFIT <br>
POTENTIAL, this program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE! And all from <br>
just 5 simple emails and five simple $5 PayPal transactions! In fact, this
<br>
program has faster results and a higher response rate than any other <br>
Internet program you could possibly participate in! For most email <br>
marketing campaigns, the average response rate is between 0.5% and 5%. <br>
However, this particular program typically generates a response rate of
<br>
between 20% and 30%. This is because this program is so easy to <br>
implement, it costs next to nothing, it takes just 30 minutes to <br>
implement, and the results can be seen within days.<br> <br>

I've been watching this type of MLM program for years and this is about
<br>
as easy and fast as you can get it. No stamps, no envelopes, no printed
<br>
copies to be made - just a little effort and faith!!! This program <br>
really keeps it "short and simple"! <br><br>

UNLIMITED income potential! <br>

This program is structured for everyone to send only 40 emails each to <br>
start. However, you are certainly not limited to 40. Send out as many <br>
emails as you want. Every 40 emails you send has a return of AT LEAST <br>
$15,000 WITHIN 90 DAYS . So, if you can email 50, or 100, or whatever, <br>
GO FOR IT! THE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT, THE MORE YOU GET OUT OF IT! <br><br>

You are probably sceptical of this, especially with all the different <br>
programs out there on the Web, but if you don't try this you will never
<br>
know. I felt exactly the same as you probably do right now. I wanted to
<br>
believe but I just couldn't help thinking that there was some sort of <br>
catch. But then I realised that I had absolutely nothing to lose. After
<br>
all, I was only being asked to invest a measly $25, and yet I could earn
<br>
many thousands of Dollars within a 3 months. And all for just half an hour
<br>
of my time! Therefore I went ahead and did exactly as the email <br>
requested. This took me around 30 minutes in total, and I'm so, so, <br>
glad I did that! <br><br>


But please play by the rules! <br><br>

This program doesn't cost anything but $25 and about half an hour of <br>
your time, and if everyone plays fair, everyone WINS!! <br>

So there it is. You now have the knowledge that will enable you to make
<br>
over $15,000 within the next few months. The only thing that can hold <br>
you back now is a lack of faith or a lack of self-belief. However, any <br>
doubts you may currently have will disappear within a few days of <br>
putting this plan into practice. Trust me on this! You certainly won't <br>
regret it. <br><br>

Some notes from the PayPal site which you may find useful <br>

PayPal lets you pay anyone with an email address and is the world's <br>
Number 1 online payment service. PayPal (as an Ebay company) is <br>
accepted on millions of eBay auctions daily, as well as a countless <br>
number of online shops. You can also use PayPal to pay your friends - <br>
for example, it's a convenient way to split the phone bill with your <br>
roommate, send cash to your kids in college, or send cash to someone in
<br>
another country. <br><br>

When you send money through PayPal, you can fund your payments with<br> 
your credit card or cheque account. You won't have to worry about your <br>
privacy, because PayPal keeps your accounting information safe and <br>
secure. Making a purchase with PayPal is far more secure than mailing a
<br>
cheque or giving your credit card number to a stranger. That's why over
<br>
63 MILLION people from around the world use PayPal to move money. <br>
Signing up for a PayPal account is free, easy, and it takes only a <br>
couple of minutes. <br><br>

Thank you, and good luck in your ventures <br><br>

P.S. Does this sound too good? Well maybe to some sceptics it is. But <br>
it actually works, and is worth the 30 minutes of your time now. So, <br>
just mix yourself a drink and get started on it now. After all, you <br>
can't lose, but you stand to gain more in the next few weeks than many <br>
people earn in a year! <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
