	Is Now the Time For Schwab Bond Funds?

In recent years, many investors have favored stock funds over bond funds. Now many of these investors are reassessing, and bond funds are receiving new attention. If you seek a balance of yield and risk, bond funds may be right for you.

Schwab Bond Funds can help you diversify and balance your portfolio, while also offering solid returns including current monthly income. SchwabFunds® offers a range of index and actively-managed bond funds, as well as taxable and tax-free bond funds. For more background on bond fund investing, read the DirectDetail™ Q&A "Why Bonds?" <http://schwab.ed10.net/ud/DQ4J/LJU3/LJPD/LE/RNP0QV>, or hear directly from SchwabFunds' portfolio managers <http://schwab.ed10.net/ud/DQ4J/KSP3/LJPD/ID/RNP0QV> for more information.

Call your Signature Services Investment Specialist at 1-800-435-8804 or click here <http://schwab.ed10.net/ud/DQ4J/ONTT/LJPD/9A/RNP0QV> for a prospectus that contains more complete information on management fees, risks and expenses. Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Principal value and investment returns will fluctuate with changes in market conditions so that an investor's shares when redeemed may be worth less than their original cost.

		New Margin Rules Affect Some Traders

You have probably heard about the new NASD and NYSE day trading margin rules. Clients who regularly hold their positions for longer than one day will not be subject to the new rules. The new day trading margin rules apply to people who day trade. There is a minimum equity requirement for those who designate themselves as day traders and people who meet the definition of "Pattern Day Traders." Pattern day traders are defined as people who buy and sell the same security including options, during the same trading session four or more times during a five day period. Day traders are subject to different margin equity requirements and must have a minimum of $25,000 equity in their account at all times.

Please contact your Schwab Signature Service Representative to learn more about margins and to discuss your trading strategy.
