Let's get together tomorrow.  My calendar is pretty open.  

Understand your request, and you have my assurance that I will be very up-front with you.  No breaking news to share with you, however.  

Would love to get your input on the organization going forward, if you have time tomorrow. 

Yes, kind of of bleak.  --Sally

Hey,

I tried not to bother you today. Spent today working on the EBS Q4 & 2002 Action Plan and the Cash Flow Forecast and generally catching up. I spoke with DiMichele & Racicot and also and got a general update. I guess things look pretty bleak.

Just one point - being that I'm 5,000 miles from home (UK) with family & kids in school - I'd obviously appreciate as much notice as possible on any implications for myself - I know that may be tough, given the pace of change around here - but bear it in mind if you can.

I would be happy to sit down and discuss any plans you may (or may not have) for me. I'm a big boy - and I realise how serious this situation is.

Thanks.

Barry.
