All,

Sorry guys, but I won't be able to make our first game unfortunately. I will
be
on vacation in sunny California. I will be back for the game the following
Sunday though. But kick some ass without me!!

I am very disappointed we didn't make it to D-1. But oh well, we'll just
have to
destroy every team by 10 goals to prove to those bastards they made a
mistake.

See y'all on the 16th.

Jay

Hi Green Roomers,

The Fall Outdoor Soccer Season is just around the corner and the schedules
have been posted to the GPSD website at
http://www.gpsdsoccer.com/
You will be surprised to learn, like I was, that we were not promoted to the
1st division.  It seems that the league has decided to keep us in 2nd even
though I registered for and said we would accept the promotion to 1st
division in order to be eligible for the championship.

Our first game is on Sunday Sept. 9th at Delta Park #8 (NE of Strasser) at
12:15.  All of the rest of the games in the 10 game season will also be at
12:15 and will occur every Sunday between Sept 9th and November 18th with
the exception of Sunday October 21st when we have a bye.  We then will have
a Championship game in early December since we will win the league again.
Right?

Don't forget to update your player care if you had a recent Birthday or are
new to the team.  You update or get a player card at the OASA league office
off of Highway 26 at the Sylvan exit.  They do have odd hours so call them
before you head up there.

Anyway that is enough from me.  See you soon out on the soccer pitch.
