Georganne, this agreement will be executed Monday, dated as of Fri, Sept 28. I am out of the office on Monday, but by this e-mail I am asking Gerald Nemec to forward to you a copy of the executed agreement.  Will you please oversee the removal of the transportation positions from the MTM books as of Sept 30 (you mentioned Jeff Gosset?). The 3Q removal is important as Northern Border will be recognizing income as a result of the agreement.  We have already discussed (casually at last Monday's mtg) our accounting. We will probably need to discuss the Purchase Price Adjustment due ENA, as it has been negotiated and is being netted against the amounts due to Northern for the transportation capacity (we are the net payor). Generally speaking, AA may notice, if so, let me know, although clearly the acctg risks in this deal belong to Northern.
