Janet / Danny,

We do have Rafael on our radar screen as a loan program participant.  

Ted and Traci have been visiting with him, and plan to talk to him when he comes to Houston in November.  FYI - he wants to return to Enron as a Manager, not an Associate.  Additional background - he was an Analyst for a year in London, was promoted to Associate and went back to Columbia for his MBA two years later.

I don't know the individual, but given 2 years as an Associate - he may be a Manager candidate.  His visits with the business units in November should prove it out.   

Regards,
Billy

Janet,
      Yes, he will be returning as an Associate.  I don't think that Billy is coordinating this trip, but I'll check.

Is he returning as an Associate? Is Billy Lemmons coordinating his trip?

Janet,
       I'd like you to talk with Rafael if you have time.  He's at Columbia on an Enron loan through the Associate Pool.  He worked for Eric Gonzales in Spain and for me in EES Europe.  He's a very bright guy and would add a lot of value where ever he lands.

Hello Danny-

I wanted to contact you as I am finishing the recruiting process out of
Columbia.  As you know, I am very interested in returning to Enron after
graduation (this May) and am in the process of getting back up to speed
on the different business units. Therefore, I am planning on making a
visit to Houston in November (tentatively 7th-9th).

I would be very interested in gaining your insight on which areas might
be a good fit and would appreciate any time you may have to discuss.
Please let me know if you would be available to meet with me sometime
during these days.  Thanks.

Best regards,

Rafael Rizo-Patron
