Pls. plan to join the Enron Corp. Board of Directors meeting scheduled for Friday, November 2, at 3:30 p.m., CST.  For planning purposes, your placement on the agenda is as follows:
Jeff McMahon		#1
Rick Buy			#2
Mark Haedicke+Others 	#7

It makes sense for Jeff and Rick to be there at 3:30.  We will call Mark at his office a few minutes before his session and the rest of his team will join via teleconference at that time.  

Please call me or Kelly Johnson (36485) if you have any questions.  

Thanks.

Paula
