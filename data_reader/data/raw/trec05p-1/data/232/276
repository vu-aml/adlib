How to Make Your Calendar Display upon ACT! Startup by Jeffrey Mayer

Have you ever wanted to view your daily calendar right when you start ACT!
instead of looking at your contacts first? You can do this easily by
writing a macro that opens the daily calendar, and then automatically
running the macro each time you start ACT!. This is how you do it:

1.  Press Alt+F5 to open the Record Macro dialog box.
2.  Name your macro and give it a description, i.e. Daily Calendar.
3.  In the Record Events field, select the Record Everything Except 
 Mouse Events option.
4.  Click Record to start recording your Macro.
5.  Press Shift+F5 to open the Daily Calendar.
6.  Press Alt+F5 to stop the recording of your macro.

To run your Daily Calendar macro when you start ACT!, do the following:

1.  Choose Preferences from the Edit menu, and click on the Startup 
 tab.
2.  Click the Browse button in the Run Macro On Startup section.
3.  Select Daily Calendar from the list of macros.  If you don't see 
 Daily Calendar in the list of macros, you may need to navigate to 
 it depending on where you installed ACT!.  For example, your macros 
 may be stored at c:/programfiles/act/macros.
4.  Click OK to save your new preferences.

When you restart ACT!, your daily calendar will now display automatically!

How to Easily Create More E-mail fields from The ACT! buzz

How many e-mail addresses do you have? Based on the number of readers
telling us about their new e-mail addresses, we’d guess most of you and
your contacts have more than one. Now, ACT! does allow you to enter
multiple e-mail addresses for a contact in the e-mail field, but the
process to use an e-mail other than the default is cumbersome. Those of you
experienced with adding or defining fields in ACT! have noticed that there
is not a field type called e-mail that you can use to modify an existing
field or to create new. Fortunately there is a simple solution. It’s a
fairly long story so instead of including it all here, please view the
complete article at:

http://www.theactbuzz.com/act_quiktrix_0114.asp

How to Use ACT! WebAccess from ACT! Extra

One of the challenges that confronts ACT! as a product is distributing the
company database information to sales reps that are geographically distant.
ACT!’s answer has been synchronization and when properly configured and
maintained, it works. But, not every remote ACT! user needs
synchronization. That is, if the remote user does not need to have an ACT!
database saved on their hardware and does have a connection to the web,
ACT! WebAccess may be a better solution. Or, if you are a company that
needs a more detailed and robust level of security on a per user basis,
WebAccess™ is the answer. Or, and this is the really cool part of this
product, if you have a web enabled phone, you can access your ACT! database
in real time, via your handset!

How to Preview ACT! Reports Automatically by Jeffrey Mayer

Many ACT! users like to preview their reports on-screen before they print
them to paper. However, by default, ACT! prints each report you create. As
an alternative to changing the Send Output To "Preview" each time you
create your report, you can go into the report itself and modify the
Default Output setting.

This is how you do it:
1.  Choose Edit Report Template from the Reports menu.
2.  Choose your report from the displayed list.
3.  Choose Define Filters from the Edit menu to display the Define 
 Filters dialog box.
4.  Select Preview from the Send output to drop-down list.
5.  Click OK.
6.  Then choose Close from the File menu, and Yes to save your changes.

Each time you run your report, you will be able to preview it prior to
printing.
