All they want is a scapegoat for the $140 MM paid out and as we did not make money off it I will not be the scapegoat. Having talked to them previously regarding balanced/unbalanced schedules they will not want the discussion to be diverted.

Thursday works for me.

It seems to me that keeping the PUC somewhat appeased makes sense.  I'll try and get some formal questions, but sooner or later they will want to talk directly. I appreciate that this is a pain, but maybe it's a good opportunity to push to get rid of balanced schedules?

Let's sit down on Thursday am and talk.
