Kim:
Well, I am now officially over in Rod Hayslett's group!  He had mentioned to me last Friday about your TransPecos deal as a potential source of cash for Enron (presumably through a monetization of cash flows from Pemex) - do you have some time to discuss or some material that I could take a look at over the holidays?

Thanks,

Kevin

Kim Watson has been running with this, and Eric has been chiming in every so often.

Steve:
Rod mentioned this deal to me last week as a potential source of cash.  Are you the commercial lead on this? If not, do you know who is?
