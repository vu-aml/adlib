Yes I know Vince and I think one of you should call him to chat before the workshop.  Either Jim or I should probably be on the call.  Thanks.

To All,

Below is the announcement of a Market Monitoring workshop to be held in San Francisco on November 16.  There is a fee to attend of $50.00.  The scope of the meeting is to discuss market monitoring in the west.  The workshop is hosted by the CAISO and co-sponsored by RTO West and WestConnect.  I am planning on attending and I'm guessing Alan and Sue will want to attend as well.  You'll see on the agenda, that the friend of the market - Anjali Sheffrin is on the first panel, so expect an action packed day!  And our own Vince Kaminsky is on panel 3 (Christi, do you know Vince and should we check with him on any positions we have?).

Kind Regards,

Dave
