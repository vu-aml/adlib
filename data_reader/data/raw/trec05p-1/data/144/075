Dear Steve:

As per your voicemail message, I have asked the HRGIS team to provide the necessary information so we can send an email message, regarding certification, to those employees at the Vice President level and above, and those employees who have not certified compliance to date.

Please see the draft message prepared for your review and comments:  

	"As you know, Enron has adopted certain policies, with the approval of the Enron Board of Directors, all of which are set forth in Enron's Code of Ethics.  In order to ensure our continuing compliance, please carefully read the policies and re-submit your statement of personal agreement by ___________________________(date).  

Use your SAP id or GIS id (global employees only) and certify your compliance at http://hrglobal.enron.com.  In addition, please be sure to include any exceptions to your certification.

The Code of Ethics is available for your review on the Enron Home Page at http://home.enron.com.

If you need assistance, please contact the Integrated Solution Center Help Desk at 713-345-4727.

Thanks for your continuing compliance."

Please let me know when you are ready to proceed with this email.

Thanks.

Sharon
