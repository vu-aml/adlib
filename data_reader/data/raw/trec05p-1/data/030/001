Jeff,
 
Just wanted to let you know that you did a great job as CEO. I don't think Enron would be in position to have a goal of being the world's leading company without you and all you have done for Enron.
 
I read you recently became engaged. Congradulations! That's exciting news. Maybe that played a role in your decision. It will be great to have more time to spend with her. 
 
I also read that the Teeside incident was the last straw. That is good to know that we had such a sensitive and caring leader. That will be missed.
 
Best wishes for you and your finance'.
I'll be praying for you.
Greg Rye
