Kay,

Below are some answers to your questions re. Cogentrix.  Please let me know if you have any more.

Power could be sold on a Day-Ahead or an Hourly basis.
They will give us a flat bogie and we will use that in our decision making.
Kenansville is a coal-fired, 30MW, plant.
We will be selling power at their bus point.  Any transmission cost, if/when incurred, will be treated on a pass-through basis.
The Min-Max decision on the number of MW's is their operational decision, and we will let them decide once we send them a draft of the revised contract.

Day ahead only?

How do we work together to set the bogie? I know on the MDEA deal there was an agreement on how it was calculated, including an agreement re the heat rates of the various units. 

Is this a gas only facility? 

How do we handle the transmission costs, or will we be selling the power at the same spot they are delivering it?

Are there minimum units of energy they will start their facility up for?

Thanks,

Kay

We'll be marketing power from their Kenansville plant on a unit contingent basis.  Together, we will establish a bogie price (their marginal cost of generation), and any value we can get them above this bogie price will earn us 25% of the extra upside we manage to get them.  They have a right to terminate with a 30-day notice and/or sell their power to other third parties at anytime.

Getting warmer.  Could you send me an email with a brief description of how you see us marketing their energy.
