Michelle,
What would you suggest?  To jog your memory, Infinity is the outsourcing group Freight Markets is using in Chicago…not for recruiting at all.  Should we just add a PWD (or whatever they're called) reflecting the different rate for the Director?

Thanks!
Amy

Amy,

Who do I need to talk to about changes to our Infinity Customer Solutions contract?

We have added a supervisor at a different rate per month and I think the contract should reflect that.

Thanks
