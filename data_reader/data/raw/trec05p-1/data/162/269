I e-mailed Whalley that we are doing nothing with EOL except supporting NewCo for now.

Piper is incorrect in the sense there is no decision on who owns the code or licence yet. 

EOL is not for sale today.

Here's my permission, in case you're interested.

If you want ENW to work in the same direction as you, let us know what the goal is beforehand.  You know I've tried to communicate.

Talk with richter and louise together if possible. Initially newco would only get an exclusive license for gas and power and not the code but I think creditors should have options so brad is still looking at determining eol value outside of a newco deal.
