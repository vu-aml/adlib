                                        Most of the Eyeforenergy team has returned from our recent, Energy, Weather and Emissions Trading conferences in Amsterdam.  With over 250 people at the event (and that&#39;s not counting the protestors and media who showed up), these events were a true success and we’d like to thank all the speakers, sponsors and delegates who came and made it what it was.
<p>
Our newsletter this week brings together a number of interesting issues.  Al Massey&#39;s written an article on the new Bush plan unveiled as a Kyoto alternative.  We&#39;ve also got a first day summary of some of the key issues emerging from the Amsterdam conference.  And we begin looking further into the world of energy management and what&#39;s out there for both the buyers and sellers of energy in terms of both key issues and concerns as well as solutions.
<p>
And finally, to end on a light note (and after a week that saw our conference attacked by people with blue wigs and water pistols, how can you end on anything else?), we&#39;ve got a joke that was forwarded to us about cows and Enron.  It certainly made us chuckle...

You borrow 80% of the forward value of the two cows from your bank, then buy another cow with 5% down and the rest financed by the seller on a note callable if your market cap goes below $20B at a rate 2 times prime. You now sell three cows to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at a 2nd bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk rights of six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to seven cows back to your listed company. The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more and this transaction process is upheld by your independent auditor and no Balance Sheet provided with the press release that announces that Enron as a major owner of cows will begin trading cows via the Internet site COW (cows on web). I am sure you now fully understand what happened.</font></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table>

Park Hyatt Hotel, Philadelphia<br>
24-25 June 2002</b><p>
Energy Management has never been more important than today. As the energy sector continues to deregulate, energy managers are finding themselves increasingly faced with new players, new tools and new choices. A solid strategy which can navigate the challenges of intense competition, online developments and a volatile market supply, is crucial to your business.
<p>
Where can you go to network with the important players in the field? Where can you get expert appraisal of your energy strategy? Where can you find out about the latest tools that can make your operations more efficient and more secure? The answer is Philadelphia this June at the Strategic Energy Management USA conference and exhibition.
