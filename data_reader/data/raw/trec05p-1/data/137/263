Internet Daily

AOL, Yahoo start charity Web site

AOL Time Warner, Yahoo and Cisco Systems announced Monday a Web 
site they've launched to enable 850,000 charities to solicit 
donations, recruit volunteers and collect comments.

The purpose of NetworkforGood.org is to help nonprofit 
organizations become more effective and efficient by integrating 
the Internet into their fundraising and related activities. "We 
will be able to make giving, volunteering and speaking out on 
issues as central a part of the Internet as shopping or getting 
e-mail," said Steve Case, AOL Time Warner's chairman.

Olympic-sized sports Web site

General Electric's NBC, Microsoft's MSNBC.com and the MSN 
network launched Monday what they said will be the largest event 
Web site in sports history. The Olympics-oriented site is 
available at http://www.olympics.com/ and 
http://www.nbcolympics.com/. During the 2002 Winter Games in 
Salt Lake City, the site will feature exclusive live results. 
Slide shows of events and athletes will be a focus of the site's 
coverage. It also includes a schedule of events and a ticket 
auction.

Investor site to charge for alerts

BestCalls.com will begin charging subscription fees for its 
CallTracker service. "The revenues generated by CallTracker 
subscriptions will be re-invested into the business to expand 
our research, customer service and marketing efforts," said Mark 
Coker, BestCalls' founder. Email alerts for conference call 
schedules and access information will cost professional 
investors and business users $495 a year; individuals will be 
charged $49.95 a year. The service currently has 80,000 
subscribers receiving its email alerts at no charge.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Overstock.com expects profitability

Overstock.com's Patrick Byrne said Monday his company has been 
profitable this month and he expects more of the same for the 
future. "We expect to be unreasoningly profitable in December 
and thereafter," the CEO said. He expects the company's sales to 
total $100 million this year. Overstock.com has specialized in 
making bulk purchases of manufacturers' and retailers' surplus 
goods. Now, the company is moving into sales of new items. Byrne 
said the company will offer as many as 350 different titles, 
included on various best-seller lists and priced 10% below 
Amazon's price. Previously, Overstock.com partnered with 
Amazon.com to sell PCs. Byrne canceled the deal, complaining of 
poor results.
