The Panthers secondary is one of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in deeper Fantasy leagues may be worth considering. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=2125&key=1184&"><B>Frank Sanders</B></A>, WR ARI - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but he's expected to play on Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary h!

n't been playing well of late, so giving Sanders some consideration in deeper leagues is advisable. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=2125&key=133230&"><B>David Boston</B></A>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Boston has become one of the premier wide receivers in Fantasy Football. He's posted three touchdowns and 217 yards receiving in his last two games, and should have another solid game vs. San Diego in Week 11. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=2125&key=187741&"><B>Tom Brady</B></A>, QB NE - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick announced late Monday that Brady will remain the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season, barring injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe to a backup role and makes him useless from a Fantasy perspective. Brady might have his hands full passing against the Saints on Sunday, but he is a fairly safe weekly starter otherwise.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=2125&key=15&"><B> Dolphins</B></A>, DT MIA - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Defensive tackle Daryl Gardener could miss the remainder of the season due to a fragmented disc in his back. He will miss at least one month to rest and rehabilitate the injury before being re-evaluated. Gardener's absence hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, which might be burned a little more by opposing running backs in the upcoming weeks.</FONT></FONT!

He will be replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup at split end, and you should keep him reserved for this week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=2125&key=1032&"><B>Mark Brunell</B></A>, QB JAC - JWillie <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Brunell's nagging leg injury might sideline him for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He decided about two hours before last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to a strained right quadriceps. Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he will start the game, so right now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as you set your lineups.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=2125&key=12753&"><B>Fred Taylor</B></A>, RB JAC - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Taylor received a second medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe groin injury could keep him out up to three months and possibly the remainder of the season, according to the <I>Florida Times-Union</I>. The diagnosis was that the injury still has not healed and will need more time to become healthy, and in the meantime Taylor has developed pain !
in!
 his hip, a side effect of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor will not play again this Fantasy season, although you should probably hold onto him until a final decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough bench.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=2125&key=1220&"><B>Rod Smith</B></A>, WR DEN - Matty <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enough for him to practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss Thursday's game against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravated it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith on your bench for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Broncos' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it would be prior to the season.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

He should roll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=2125&key=187741&"><B>Tom Brady</B></A>, QB NE - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/20/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. "I don't see any changes this week," coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to your !

. He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=2125&key=12375&"><B>Doug Flutie</B></A>, QB SD - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/20/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Mike Riley told the <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i> there is no QB controversy involving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. "Doug is going to be our quarterback," he said. "You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next week." Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&rando!
