Dear Evening STudents,

I see that Haas Computing has enabled the Terminal Server. This should
allow you access to the library's databases without going through the
proxy bit. The Terminal Server, once you have it set up (yes, there is an
initial setup involved), will bring the Haas desktop with all its
applications to your desktop. You can now use all the software that is
available to you in Haas Computer Lab from your home. If it works as
promised (boy, I sound jaded!), you will really like it.

Caveat:
 I have not tried using the Terminal Server from off-campus yet,
so I can't say with absolute assurance that the databases will in fact be
available remotely as well. 

To use the terminal server, you have to be
using Internet Explorer version 5.0 or above and Windows 2000 and you will
be directed to download and install the server's client. 

If you try it and it works for you, send me an email. I don't have Windows
at home and can't test it from here myself.

Monica  Singh
