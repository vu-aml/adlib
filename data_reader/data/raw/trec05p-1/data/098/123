INSIDER'S TIP - Get in shape for the season!

It's time to think about elevating your game. The difference
between a good skier or snowboarder and a great one is often
just a matter of flexibility and fitness.  And, it's never too late,
or soon enough, to start getting ready for the winter season.

Visit http://promotions.snow.com/927200130.asp to learn
more about an exercise program that targets all the areas that
the sport will test. It will also tune your aerobic capacity to
get you ready for the increase in altitude.
