Political Hot Topics
(Today's top political stories from news organizations across the country)

WHITE HOUSE SEEKS WAR CZAR: The White House wants to appoint a high-powered czar to oversee the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan with authority to issue directions to the Pentagon, the State Department and other agencies, but it has had
trouble finding anyone able and willing to take the job, according to people close to the situation. At least three
retired four-star generals approached by the White House in recent weeks have declined to be considered for the
position, the sources said, underscoring the administration's difficulty in enlisting its top recruits to join the team
after five years of warfare that have taxed the United States and its military... The White House has not publicly
disclosed its interest in creating the position, hoping to find someone President Bush can anoint and announce for the
post all at once. Washington Post: 3 Generals Spurn the Position of War 'Czar'
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/10/AR2007041001776.html

"SOME OF HIS MOST POINTED LANGUAGE TO DATE": President Bush, at loggerheads with Congress over an emergency Iraq
spending bill, accused Democrats on Tuesday of behaving irresponsibly, as the two sides moved closer to confrontation
over whether - or how far - lawmakers could push Mr. Bush toward withdrawing troops. With the Senate back at work after
a weeklong Easter recess, Mr. Bush chose a favorable venue - an American Legion post in Fairfax, Va. - to renew his
threat to veto any measure that included a timetable for withdrawal. The speech included some of his most pointed
language to date. "Democratic leaders in Congress are bent on using a bill that funds our troops to make a political
statement about the war," Mr. Bush said. "They need to do it quickly and get it to my desk so I can veto it, and then
Congress can get down to the business of funding our troops without strings and without further delay." New York Times:
Bush Criticizes Democrats for Delay in Iraq Spending Bill http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/11/washington/11prexy.html

ARMY RESERVE RECRUITING DOWN: The Army Reserve, whose troops drive trucks on bomb-riddled roads and help set up local
governments in Iraq and Afghanistan, is struggling to recruit soldiers. The Army Reserve missed its recruiting goal by
5% last year and is 9% short of its target this year, records show. Halfway through the 2007 budget year, it was nearly
1,300 soldiers short of its midyear goal of 14,273. Reserves provide much of the logistical support for troops in
combat, such as transporting tanks from Kuwait to Iraq or helping local governments. Reserve combat engineers are in
demand for clearing roads of homemade bombs known as improvised explosive devices. Before the 9/11 terror attacks,
reservists could count on training one weekend a month and two weeks in the summer. They might be called to active duty
in an emergency. Those days are over, said Lt. Gen. Jack Stultz, the Army Reserve's top officer. USA Today: Army
Reserve falters on recruitment http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-04-10-army-reserve-recruitment_N.htm

POLL FINDS "WIDESPREAD UNEASE" ABOUT ECONOMY: Americans are worried about the economy and believe that a recession is
looming, but their faith in real estate remains fierce, according to a Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg poll. Nearly a third
of those polled predicted home values in their neighborhood would increase in the next six months. Only 16% anticipated
a decrease. The rest said values would hold steady. Call it foolish faith or bold optimism, the forecast is at odds
with the downward trend of home prices... Real estate aside, however, the poll of 1,373 adults reflected widespread
unease about the U.S. economy. Los Angeles Times: Faith in home values persists
http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-housing11apr11,0,5209585.story

MOST SAY GONZALES SHOULD RESIGN: U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales should resign, most Americans say, and White
House aides should be forced to testify before Congress about their involvement in the dismissal of eight U.S.
attorneys. In a new Bloomberg/Los Angeles Times poll, conducted April 5 to 9, 53 percent of respondents said Gonzales
should leave his post. Seventy-four percent said White House staff members who had discussions about the firings with
Gonzales's chief of staff should testify under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which the White House has
refused to allow. Still, a strong majority in the survey, 63 percent, said they believe the Democratic-led Congress is
seeking political gain in the investigations of the attorney dismissals, unauthorized wiretapping of U.S. citizens and
substandard conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Only 28 percent said the inquiries were driven by concern
over ethics. Bloomberg: Most Want Gonzales Out, Aides to Testify, Poll Shows
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&sid=arENzt9rUjWc

FIRST SUBPOENA ISSUED IN FIRINGS INQUIRY: The House Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena yesterday to Attorney General
Alberto R. Gonzales, demanding that the Justice Department turn over hundreds of pages of new or uncensored records
related to the firings of eight U.S. attorneys last year. The subpoena is the first served in connection with the
dismissals, and it escalates the legal confrontation between Democrats and the Bush administration, which has resisted
demands for more documents and for public testimony from White House aides. The order comes just a week before the
embattled attorney general is scheduled to testify in the Senate, a hearing widely considered crucial to his attempt to
keep his job. House and Senate committees have authorized a series of subpoenas in recent weeks as part of their
investigations of the prosecutor firings but have not issued one until now. Washington Post: House Panel Issues First
Subpoena Over Firings http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/10/AR2007041000839.html

GOP WORRIED OVER "SIGNS OF DESPONDENCY" IN PARTY: Republican leaders across the country say they are growing
increasingly anxious about their party's chances of holding the White House, citing public dissatisfaction with
President Bush, the political fallout from the war in Iraq and the problems their leading presidential candidates are
having generating enthusiasm among conservative voters. In interviews on Tuesday, the Republicans said they were
concerned about signs of despondency among party members and fund-raisers, reflected in polls and the Democratic
fund-raising advantage in the first quarter of the year. Many party leaders expressed worry that the party's
presidential candidates faced a tough course without some fundamental shift in the political dynamic. New York Times:
Some in G.O.P. Express Worry Over '08 Hopes http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/11/us/politics/11repubs.html

DEAN WILL ATTEMPT TO DOUSE POLITICAL FIRE IN DENVER: Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman Howard Dean will fly
to Denver today to try and put out a political fire that has led labor groups to threaten to withdraw support from the
2008 Democratic National Convention. In urgent meetings with union leaders and members of the convention host
committee, he will attempt to take action to head off the threat that Democratic delegates attending the convention
next year will have to cross picket lines to get in. The dispute, which tarnishes Dean's first visit to Denver since
the party selected the city to host the convention, arises from labor's fury over what it sees as a betrayal by newly
elected Democratic Gov. Bill Ritter. The Hill: Dean on mission to Denver
http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/dean-on-mission-to-denver-2007-04-10.html

GIULIANI, McCAIN BACK IMUS: Embattled radio host Don Imus is getting support from many of the politicians and
journalists who frequently grace his show - including presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani. Despite many calls for the
shock jock's resignation, Giuliani said he would again appear with Imus, and after talking to him on the phone he
believes Imus "understands that he made a very, very big mistake." "I take Don at his word that he understands the
gravity of what he said," Giuliani told the Daily News. "He seems sincerely sorry about it and seems like someone who
will endeavor not to do that again and I take him at his word." Giuliani was not the only White House hopeful to say he
would again chat on air with Imus. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a frequent guest whose campaign Imus has backed, said he
would continue to appear with the cranky commentator. New York Daily News: Rudy, McCain say they forgive and support
http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/04/11/2007-04-11_rudy_mccain_say_they_forgive_and_support-2.html

OBAMA AVOIDS COMMENT FOR FIVE DAYS, LANDS ON A1 FOR IT: With the Rev. Al Sharpton leading calls Monday for radio host
Don Imus to be fired over racially insensitive remarks, Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign avoided the
controversy throughout the day. Not until Monday evening, five days after Imus's comments were uttered and hours after
CBS Radio and MSNBC announced a two-week suspension for the radio host, did Obama weigh in, saying in a statement: "The
comments of Don Imus were divisive, hurtful, and offensive to Americans of all backgrounds." Obama did not address
whether he thought Imus should be taken off the air. Boston Globe: Obama's silence on Imus alarms some blacks
http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/04/11/obamas_silence_on_imus_alarms_some_blacks/

McCAIN WILL FIND "GENERALLY RECEPTIVE" AUDIENCE AT VMI: In recent years, Virginia Military Institute, with its turreted
buildings and surrounding mountains, has been a scenic and suitably martial backdrop for supporters of the Bush
administration to report on its foreign policy hopes and achievements... On Wednesday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the
most outspoken supporter of the war in the field of 2008 presidential candidates, will argue that success in Iraq is
essential to the nation's security. McCain will find an audience generally receptive to the message on which he is
staking his presidential campaign. But the 1,200 cadets at the state-run military school are hardly unaware of the
uncertainties about the U.S. mission in Iraq that threaten McCain's candidacy. Washington Post: McCain Likely to Find
Friendly Audience at VMI http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/10/AR2007041001498.html

ROMNEY WALKS A FINE LINE IN TX: Sharing a stage with President Bush's father Tuesday, Republican presidential candidate
Mitt Romney walked a fine line of praising the Bush administration while making a case for new leadership. "We are
fortunate today to have a president who loves America, who acts solely out of a desire to protect her and to promote
liberty around the world," the former Massachusetts governor said during an address at the George Bush Presidential
Library and Museum. "But I think most Americans look at Washington and are appalled at the divisiveness, the
bitterness, the smallness." Romney was the second of three 2008 Republican presidential hopefuls scheduled to visit the
library, hosted by former President Bush, the 41st president. Houston Chronicle: In College Station, Romney criticizes
Washington's divisiveness http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/politics/4704214.html

ROMNEY LEADS THE PACK IN AD SPENDING: Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who was the biggest Republican fundraiser
in the first quarter of 2007, has also spent by far the most of any candidate on television and radio ads while he has
lagged in third and fourth place in public opinion polls. One recent Gallup/USA Today poll showed Romney tied with Sen.
Sam Brownback (R-Kan.), who has raised about a tenth of Romney's $23 million, raising questions as to whether money
will be enough to win over conservative primary voters. Romney has spent about $1.3 million since the end of February
to buy advertising time in an effort to appeal to conservative voters in Florida, South Carolina, and New Hampshire,
according to records made available by stations in those and neighboring states. He is estimated to have spent another
million dollars producing the advertisements. The Hill: Romney's $2.5M leads ad spend
http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/romneys-2.5m-leads-ad-spend-2007-04-10.html

GIULIANI SAYS CONFEDERATE FLAG IS A STATE ISSUE: In his first campaign swing into Alabama, GOP presidential hopeful
Rudy Giuliani on Tuesday stressed similarities between himself and Alabamians - support for low taxes, for the war on
terror and for smaller government. What he did not dwell on were positions on issues that likely divide him from many
GOP core supporters in Alabama, namely his support for abortion rights, gun control and same-sex civil unions. He did
acknowledge the divide, though. "With every single candidate, there are going to be areas you agree and areas you
disagree," Giuliani said during an address to a joint session of the Legislature. "It's just not realistic that you are
going to 100 percent agree with a candidate... Heck, I don't agree with myself all of the time."... Asked about the
flying of the Confederate flag in some Southern states, Giuliani said, "That's a good thing to be left on a
state-by-state basis." Birmingham News: Giuliani stresses common ground with state's voters

CAN A RESTAURANT OWNER CRAFT THE RIGHT MESSAGE FOR HUNTER? There's not much about Rep. Duncan Hunter's (R-Calif.) run
for president that's out of a slick Washington playbook. So his hire of a longtime buddy, restaurateur Roy Tyler, as
his communications director comes as no surprise. Tyler's résumé hardly reads like that of most top campaign press
folks' - instead of flacking, he was slinging salsa as the owner of Tyler's Taste of Texas restaurants in Southern
California. (He met Hunter at one of the locations, which Hunter dubbed his "second office.") But he insisted that 38
years in the food biz has prepared him to be Hunter's spokesman. "It's all people skills," Tyler said. Working for the
campaign was, as the saying goes, an opportunity he couldn't resist. "How often in your life do you have one of your
best friends run for president?" Tyler wondered. And Tyler's no doubt already learned something about customers that
applies to political journos: They're most content when fed something juicy. Roll Call: Heard on the Hill
