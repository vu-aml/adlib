Subject: [Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Terry Glenn Late Injury

Hi Folks,

You guys that got fired up after Terry Glenn's outstanding performance (I'm
one of you) last week need to keep an eye on this.

Foxboro, MA (Sports Network) - Patriots wide receiver Terry Glenn injured
his hamstring during a workout on Thursday, and may not suit up for Sunday's
game against the Colts.

Midway through the Patriots' afternoon session, Glenn came up hobbling after
making a cut on a pass route. The extent of his injury is not known.

Glenn also experienced soreness after the team's 29-26 overtime win over the
Chargers last week. Yet, he may have aggravated the injury on Thursday,
possibly resulting in a pull or tear.

The six-year Ohio State product caught seven passes for 110 yards with a
touchdown in his first game back since being suspended on August 3 for
violating the league's substance abuse policy.


[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]


This is all I know for right now.   We'll keep you posted.

Thanks to Footballguy Matt Rosenthal for pointing me to this one.

Joe
