Hi all

This is an interesting study being conducted by Stanford University Psych. 
Dept. (I know we're not suppose to associate with the "southerners" but I 
felt we can make an exception here.)  

It can be completed online and takes 15-20 minutes.

"WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ABOUT THE RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS ON 
AMERICA?

YOU CAN HELP: Stanford University scientists need your help to better 
understand how individuals like you across America and around the world are 
coping with the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The accompanying 
CONFIDENTIAL survey designed for adults (18 or over) asks questions about 
your reactions to the events and about your personal background. Your 
experiences and your views are extremely important, as they will enable us to 
document the range of individuals' reactions &#8212; from distress to 
resilience &#8212; in the face of tragedy. Your participation in this 15-20 
minute survey will help us to understand and promote better ways to cope with 
such events."
