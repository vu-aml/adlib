Dear Jeff,

How are you doing? I sincerely hope everything is fine with you, I know it is a pretty rough time for the company. Please let me know if there is anything I can do, and I would love to do whatever I can to help you go through the tough time. You are my hero, and I know you can make it!

All the best!
