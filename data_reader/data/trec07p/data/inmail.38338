Opponents hammer Clinton on Iraq

By CNN's Ted Barrett and Dana Bash

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Some of Sen. Hillary Clinton's Democratic presidential opponents are accusing the New York Democrat
of giving contradictory statements and being intentionally vague about a critically important issue: her position on
Iraq.

Clinton is denying the charge, which stems from conflicting answers about the meaning of her "yes" vote cast Wednesday
on a proposal to cut off funding for Iraq.

Romney works to build support

By CNN Political Desk Editor Jamie Crawford

ATLANTA (CNN) -- Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney picked up a telephone Wednesday night and joined volunteers in a
phone banking effort to recruit 24,000 new supporters to his presidential campaign in a 24 hour period.

DOJ WEIGHED FIRING 26 PROSECUTORS: The Justice Department considered dismissing many more U.S. attorneys than officials
have previously acknowledged, with at least 26 prosecutors suggested for termination between February 2005 and December
2006, according to sources familiar with documents withheld from the public. Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales
testified last week that the effort was limited to eight U.S. attorneys fired since last June, and other administration
officials have said that only a few others were suggested for removal. In fact, D. Kyle Sampson, then Gonzales's chief
of staff, considered more than two dozen U.S. attorneys for termination, according to lists compiled by him and his
colleagues, the sources said. Washington Post: Justice Weighed Firing 1 in 4

"RELUCTANT CRITIC" COMEY: For a loyal George W. Bush Republican, James B. Comey has made a remarkable amount of trouble
for the White House. As deputy attorney general in 2003, he appointed his old friend Patrick J. Fitzgerald as
independent counsel in the C.I.A. leak case, leading to the perjury conviction of Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of
staff, I. Lewis Libby Jr.  In 2004, he backed Justice Department subordinates who withdrew a legal memorandum
justifying harsh interrogations of suspected terrorists. This spring, more than a year after leaving the government, he
publicly praised several United States attorneys who had been dismissed, undermining the administration's claim that
they were removed for poor performance. Finally, at a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Mr. Comey gave a riveting account of
how he intervened in 2004 at the hospital bedside of Attorney General John Ashcroft to prevent two top White House
officials from persuading Mr. Ashcroft to reauthorize the National Security Agency's domestic eavesdropping program.

IRAQ VOTE A "BRUISING DEFEAT" FOR REID: The Senate yesterday overwhelmingly rejected a bid to pull out troops from Iraq
and cut off funds for combat, a bruising defeat for Majority Leader Harry Reid that highlights the Democratic split
over how far to go in opposing the war. The amendment, which was co-sponsored by Mr. Reid, Nevada Democrat, died in a
67-29 procedural vote, with 47 Republicans, 19 Democrats and one independent blocking the plan to start a troop
withdrawal in 120 days and cut off funds March 31 to most military operations in Iraq. "We don't want to send the
message to the troops" that they lost the backing of Congress, said Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, chairman of the Armed
Services Committee and one of several key Democrats to defect. "We're going to support those troops." Washington Times:

MORE NEGOTIATIONS IN "EXHAUSTIVE TEST OF WILLS": Congressional Democrats and President Bush's top aides will enter
another round of high-stakes negotiations on funding for the Iraq war in what has become an exhaustive test of wills.
The talks are expected to continue for days, as the each side struggles for the upper hand. "To be successful, we must
end the finger-pointing and instead roll up our sleeves and work together. I believe that we can - and we will," said
Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. At stake is the nearly $90 billion Bush says is needed to pay for military operations in Iraq
and Afghanistan through September. Earlier this month, Congress sent - and Bush vetoed - a $124.2 billion bill that
would have funded the war but ordered troop withdrawals to begin by Oct. 1. AP via Yahoo! News: Talks to resume on bill

"RUMORS" AND "COUNTER-RUMORS" AS WOLFOWITZ HANGS ON: The Bush administration spent much of yesterday trying to broker a
graceful end to the ethics controversy consuming the World Bank, offering the resignation of embattled president Paul
D. Wolfowitz, senior administration and bank officials said. But Wolfowitz said he would not leave, insisting on a
measure of vindication. On a day full of rumors, counter-rumors and closed-door meetings, the Wolfowitz saga turned
into an only-in-Washington standoff. The bank's executive board, under pressure from governments worldwide to remove
Wolfowitz in response to findings that he engineered and covered up a hefty raise for his girlfriend, appeared intent
on forcing him out without voting to fire him. The board adjourned without resolution late yesterday, promising to keep
talking today. Washington Post: Wolfowitz Hangs On As Ouster Hits Wall

DC JUDGE TO HEAR ARGUMENTS IN PLAME SUIT: A lawsuit brought by a CIA agent whose cover was blown by Bush administration
officials, Valerie Plame, is expected to face a withering attack this morning at a court hearing in Washington. Through
their attorneys, the defendants in the case have denounced it as a political vendetta on the part of Ms. Plame and her
husband, Joseph Wilson, a former ambassador. Named in the lawsuit are Vice President Cheney, his former chief of staff,
I. Lewis Libby Jr., President Bush's top political adviser, Karl Rove, and a former deputy secretary of state, Richard
Armitage. "This case is a political exercise masquerading as a civil lawsuit," Mr. Armitage's lawyers complained in
their motion to dismiss the case. Judge John Bates is scheduled to hear two hours of arguments today on whether the
suit should go forward. New York Sun: Plame Seeks Showdown With Cheney http://www.nysun.com/article/54630

SCHUMER TAPS MENENDEZ AS NUMBER 2 AT DSCC: By naming Sen. Bob Menendez (N.J.) vice chairman of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, current Chairman Charles Schumer (N.Y.) may be quietly laying the groundwork for his
prospective successor at the fundraising arm, key party sources said Wednesday. Schumer, the two-time DSCC chairman who
already has made his mark by helping Democrats recapture the Senate in 2006, announced Tuesday that Menendez would take
on the No. 2 DSCC post — a position that the committee describes as involving "all aspects of the committee's work to
strengthen the Democratic majority in the Senate, including candidate recruitment, strategy, fundraising and
campaigning for Democratic candidates." Like Schumer, Menendez is known as one of the Democrats' most ambitious
Senators as well as a prolific fundraiser and aggressive campaigner. Roll Call: Menendez on Deck at DSCC?

DEM SPLIT ON LOBBYING REFORM: Lobbying reform is causing headaches for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), now
tasked with repairing a split in her caucus as freshmen advocate for stricter rules while some senior members fight to
preserve the status quo. Rep. Jason Altmire (D-Pa.) and his fellow freshman Democrats are clamoring to pass a lobbying
reform bill over the objections of some entrenched conservative lawmakers and congressmen who represent poor districts.
During the freshman Democrats' weekly breakfast with Pelosi yesterday, they championed the idea of political reform
without discussing the specifics of the bill set to be marked up today by the Judiciary Committee. The Hill: Tougher

SANDY BERGER GIVES UP LAW LICENSE: Samuel R. Berger, the Clinton White House national security adviser who was caught
taking highly classified documents from the National Archives, has agreed to forfeit his license to practice law. In a
written statement issued by Larry Breuer, Mr. Berger's attorney, the former national security adviser said he pleaded
guilty in the Justice Department investigation, accepted the penalties sought by the department and recognized that his
law license would be affected. "I have decided to voluntarily relinquish my license," he said. "While I derived great
satisfaction from years of practicing law, I have not done so for 15 years and do not envision returning to the
profession. I am very sorry for what I did, and I deeply apologize." Washington Times: Clinton aide forfeits law

MISSING CHAPTERS IN SOME PRESIDENTIAL BIOS: Stealing a page from the Soviet playbook, the current crop of presidential
candidates has taken to eliminating whole chapters of their histories. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's turbulent final
years as first lady? While Mrs. Clinton, a New York Democrat, frequently invokes husband Bill on the stump, she has
managed to avoid any mention of his impeachment and the unpleasantness leading to it. Senator John McCain, Republican
of Arizona, almost never brings up campaign finance overhaul, perhaps his signature achievement in the Senate... For
his part, Mr. Romney likes to promote his experience as a governor, but is often coy about the state he governed. New

BUNCH OF RICH PEOPLE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT: Running for president is a pursuit for the wealthy, according to personal
financial disclosure forms released yesterday that show that at least 10 of the major party candidates are millionaires
and, collectively, the field of contenders is worth at least a quarter-billion dollars. The candidates have amassed
their fortunes in a variety of fashions. Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) wrote his way to millionaire status with a
best-selling memoir. Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani (R) raked in $11 million by trotting the globe giving
speeches last year. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) married money -- his wife is the millionaire daughter of an Arizona beer
magnate. Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney (R) became the richest of the 2008 candidates for the White House by
dealing in private equity funds that have bought and sold significant interests in more than 180 companies. Washington

OBAMA THE "POOREST": The poor man among the top tier of presidential candidates is Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.), who
scraped by last year on an income of just under $1 million. A required federal financial disclosure form the campaign
released on Wednesday showed that the senator's popularity generated $572,000 in book royalties last year, contributing
to Obama family income of $991,000. The financial disclosure reports and additional financial details provided by some
candidates offered a portrait of a campaign in which the major candidates often have divergent political views but all
could belong to a millionaires' club. Obama reported his family's net worth as between $456,000 and $1.14 million, not
including the equity in the Kenwood home he bought two years ago for $1.65 million. Chicago Tribune: Disclosures
suggest a millionaires' club http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-money17may17,1,4270430.story

NOT MUCH DIVERSITY AMONG TOP GOP '08 ADVISERS: When the leading Republican presidential candidates sit down with their
top advisers, those with a seat at the table don't exactly look like America, to use the phrase popularized by former
President Clinton. The 2008 presidential race is notable for the presence of a woman and a black among the leading
Democratic candidates. But progress is much slower when it comes to diversifying the ranks of top decision-makers
within the various campaigns, especially those of the Republicans. The campaigns of the top GOP candidates - Mitt
Romney, John McCain, Rudy Giuliani - couldn't point to any key advisers who are black, although there are some women in
the top tier. Not unsurprisingly, those campaigns with the most women and minorities among top staff members are
Democrats Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama. AP via Yahoo! News: Democrats seek diversity in advisers
http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070517/ap_on_el_pr/2008_campaign_staff_diversity

IMPRESSION OF McCAIN'S HEALTH COULD BE "LIABILITY": As he exited the stairs of his "Straight Talk Express" campaign bus
on a chilly March day in Iowa, Sen. John McCain carefully took one step at a time, his left hand gripping a rail and
his right knee looking stiff. A bum knee isn't surprising in a 70-year-old man — particularly one whose right leg was
shattered about four decades ago when his jet fighter was shot down over North Vietnam. But his wooden movements, along
with his age and appearance, are creating an impression about McCain's health that could be a liability for the Arizona
Republican as he tries to persuade Americans to elect him president. McCain brings to the campaign a body and mind with
some heavy wear and tear, including a couple of bouts of cancer and the effects of years of torture. If elected, he
would be the oldest person in history to enter the White House, and if he served two terms he would leave office an
octogenarian. Los Angeles Times: McCain: Physically fit to serve as president?

RUDY GOES AFTER "VILLAGE" FREE MARKET LINE: Flush with confidence after his debate smackdown of a minor rival, Rudy
Giuliani took a break from beating on other Republicans yesterday to go after the Dems - with a special mention for
Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.). Giuliani took the risk of looking past the GOP presidential nomination contest to focus
on the "leading Democrat" he could face in the general election. And he did it by dredging up a disputed 11-year-old
passage in Clinton's book "It Takes a Village." According to Giuliani, Clinton said in a C-Span appearance that "the
unfettered free market is the most devastating force in modern America." "That's pretty scary," he said. "America is
about the free market." But the quote was actually from an author Clinton had cited in the book, according to a
transcript supplied by the pro-Clinton Media Matters group. New York Daily News: Giuliani takes shot at Hil after
feasting on his GOP guppies
