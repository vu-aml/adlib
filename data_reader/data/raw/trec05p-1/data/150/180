Hello,

Thanks for the email.  I would like to talk more, but since I don't know
you I haven't a clue as to what to talk about.  I did notice you live in
Morrison, do you work there also?  I like that area.  What about you and
this service, have you been using it long, and do you like it?  Drop me
a line and I'll start firing back questions.

Paul

hi. I saw your profile and you seem like an interesting person. Take a
look at mine and email back if you want to talk more.

The following is my profile text:

Some people would describe me as "having a lot of energy," friendly,
outgoing, intuitive and kind. I am physically fit, but not perfect. I
enjoy working out by going to the gym, hiking, mountain biking and
snowshoeing. I am in the Consulting sales and management area. For fun I
love to hang out with my friends and family, go on spontaneous
adventurous trips, go to parties, read, hike and attend sporting events.
The types of music that move me are songs that actually have something
to say about life and romantic, classical music. I am the happiest when
I'm healthy and everything is going great. I am happy when I'm with my
family and friends and the person that I am with. I am the most at peace
when I am away from noise and surrounded by beauty. What I have done
that makes me the proudest of myself is achieving things that I thought
I never could. If I could invite any 5 people to dinner it would be my
parents, my best friend, the person that I'm in love with and my
favorite cousin. My idea of a perfect date is having a nice dinner and
staying up all night talking. I am looking for someone who is easy to
talk to, non-judgemental, and who enjoys life to the fullest. I am not
the type of person who likes to meet people in a bar setting. I am
looking for someone who makes me laugh and appreciates who I am.
