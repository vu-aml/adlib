Louise,

Sorry to bother you with this request, but I'm not sure who else to ask:

A number of people have expressed an interest in the details of the auction process and any insight it might provide as to what a final deal might look like.

Are there publically available documents covering the auctions process and descriptions of compliant bids?

Dave
