Our play toys nurture creative spirits.

Remember what it was like to be a kid? You just couldn't 
grow up fast enough. Things haven't changed--your kids love 
to pretend they're just like you. In fact, chances are they're 
already imitating the things you do around the house. Playing 
with Dad's tools and dressing up in Mom's clothes are all a 
natural part of growing up. 

The best toys for imaginative play are ones that encourage 
kids to try out these new roles in a way that's safe and fun. 
Our Workbench Desk and Tool Kit let children pretend to fix 
things, and a Vanity Table and Makeup Kit make it fun to dress 
up for that special tea party.
