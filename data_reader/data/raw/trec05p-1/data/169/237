Ordinarily fine, however;

This was a pre-petition commitment by Enron and is not necessarily now a commitment of the estate
Presuming we get purchased, things should return to normal presuming the buyer honors all these commitment (that's how we have set it up).

As you know I have Business Flights home each year under my contract.  As I will be unable to travel to the UK due to the requirement to be in Houston over the holidays I intend to use them for my parents, borther and sister-in-law.  Any difference in the cost I intend to cover or offset against the cheques from expenses which bounced until we can figure out whether Enron intends to meet expense payments.
