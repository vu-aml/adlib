Friends,
Just a quick update on what I've been doing since leaving HoustonStreet.

Press Release
SOURCE: Ashton Technology Group, Inc. 
The Ashton Technology Group, Inc. and Subsidiary of OptiMark Holdings, Inc.
Announce Strategic Investment and Bridge Financing
OptiMark Innovations Inc. to Provide Ashton With $30 Million in Intellectual
Property and Operating Capital; Other Parties Provide $500,000 Bridge
Financing
PHILADELPHIA & JERSEY CITY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 5, 2002-- The Ashton
Technology Group, Inc. (BB: ASTN.OB) and OptiMark Innovations Inc., a
corporation owned by affiliates of SOFTBANK Capital Partners and OptiMark,
Inc. (OptiMark), a wholly owned subsidiary of OptiMark Holdings, Inc.,
announced today the signing of a definitive agreement representing a
strategic investment in Ashton. 
Additionally, Ashton announced that HK Weaver Group Limited has agreed to
provide Ashton with up to $500,000 in bridge financing. 
As part of the agreement with Ashton, upon closing, OptiMark Innovations
will provide Ashton with assets valued at $30 million, including $10 million
in cash, as well as intellectual property, licenses and management
expertise. In return, OptiMark Innovations will own at least 80% of the
outstanding shares of Ashton. Closing of the transaction is contingent upon,
among other things, shareholder approval to increase the number of Ashton's
authorized shares, completion of certain creditor negotiations, closing of a
private equity investment in OptiMark Innovations and installation of a new
Board of Directors commensurate with OptiMark Innovation's ownership stake
in Ashton. 
Upon closing of the strategic investment, Ashton will, through broker-dealer
subsidiaries, offer a unique service for sell-side firms acting as agents,
to offer cost-effective guaranteed Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
orders to their clients. To provide these guaranteed VWAP orders, Ashton
will become a principal trading firm using state-of-the-art electronic
trading algorithms that over the past five years have demonstrated the
viability of this approach by achieving returns approximating VWAP. Ashton
will continue to operate its eVWAP® facility for orders submitted
anonymously from buy-side institutions. 
Upon the closing of the transaction, Robert Warshaw, OptiMark's Chief
Executive, will become interim CEO of Ashton, replacing Fred Rittereiser.
Trevor Price, OptiMark's Executive Vice President for Product Strategy and
Marketing, will become Ashton's Chief Operating Officer. James Pak,
OptiMark's Executive Vice President for Strategic Development, will become
Ashton's Chief Financial Officer. Fred Weingard, Ashton's Chief Technology
Officer, will retain that position and his board seat. Additionally, William
Uchimoto will continue as Ashton General Counsel and a member of the
executive management team. Jennifer Andrews will keep her current
responsibilities and will assume the title of Executive Vice President,
Finance. 
Mr. Warshaw said, ``Ashton, under Fred Rittereiser's visionary leadership
and innovation, has laid the foundation for what we believe can become a
highly profitable business. We bring, in addition to needed operating
capital, the critical ability as principal traders, to provide liquidity and
guaranteed fills for VWAP orders for the sell-side firms.'' Mr. Warshaw
added that Mr. Rittereiser would serve as a special advisor to the Board of
Directors 
Mr. Rittereiser said, ``OptiMark Innovation's intellectual property,
technical support, operating capital and strong Wall Street relationships
were key ingredients in the strategic partnership. The combination will
create a stronger, well-capitalized firm which will accelerate the
implementation of a new competitive business model.''
