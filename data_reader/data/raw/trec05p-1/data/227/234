Hi Larry,

Just wanted to see how you're doing these days.  I'm glad to hear things are finally up and running and that you all have stuff to do now.  I'm with the rest of the lepers down on the fourth floor these days.  We'll have to round up a group to grab a drink after work sometime.

Susan
