Welcome to the first edition of the The Seasoned Speculator =
newsletter, where we will be introducing small and microcap =
stocks that we believe offer exceptional growth potential in =
2005 and beyond. Many may be appropriate for inclusion in your =
aggressive growth or speculative wealth building portfolio allocation.=

TELEVISION [TNXT] COMPANY PROFILE=0D=0A=0D=0ABUSINESS: Installs, =
operates and manages in-commuter train television. TNX holds =
concession contracts with privately owned train operating companies. =
Their TV content is near real-time television news, information =
and entertainment. Initial contracts are predominantly with =
London commuter trains. =0D=0A=0D=0A =0D=0A=0D=0ACompany Website: =

First Mover Advantage: TNX Television sports a very a desirable =
advertising demographic due to its =E2=80=9Ccaptive=E2=80=9D =
audience of urban business commuters, which can be targeted =
specifically by region or even by individual route.  Like most =
of the Seasoned Speculator 21st century picks, their business =
model is both scalable and globally replicable. Potential new =
major markets are Europe and Asia, as well as the US and Canada. =

to other transport systems such as trams and buses.=0D=0A=0D=0A =0D=0A=

We are in the process of building what will be the second largest =
commercial network in the UK.  We will have the best demographics =
and be building a world class network that is both scalable =
and expandable.  To do this we have put together a world class =
team of people including some outstanding board members to grow =
the company. We now have almost 80 cars in operation and the =
programming and response from the traveling public is outstanding.  =
We as a company are excited about the reception we have gotten =
and the product that we deliver.=0D=0A=0D=0A =0D=0A=0D=0AToday =
we are on our way to building a profitable long term business, =
which will potentially pay our shareholders a very handsome =
return on their investment.  You can see us at www.360onboard.com.=0D=0A=
=0D=0A =0D=0A=0D=0ATHREE MILESTONES TO A BIG BANG=0D=0A=0D=0AThe =
first is obviously its large scale London roll out. =0D=0AThe =
second would be a significant Northern American, European or =
Asian contract. =0D=0AFinally, the end game is a media buyout =
or major long term strategic alliance.=0D=0A =0D=0A=0D=0AMARKET =
ANALYSIS =0D=0AIn the beginning of the year, we expected sufficient =
support between .50 and the 2004 low of .58. There was not, =
and the stock quickly dropped and became oversold.  We then =
upgraded TNXT from an accumulate to a buy under .38=0D=0A=0D=0AThere =
is significant overhead resistance between .90 and $1. When =
broken with new good news, $1.50 and $3 become natural price =
targets.  =0D=0A=0D=0A  =0D=0A=0D=0ABOTTOM LINE =0D=0A=0D=0AThere =
is growing interest in communicating with consumers outside =
the home because advertisers are losing control of the living =
room.  It is reasonable to assume that should TNX Television =
meet its milestones, its stock is likely to handsomely reward =
share holders with far above average stock market returns.  =
Once this stock becomes =E2=80=9Cdiscovered=E2=80=9D, then $1 =
will become the floor and not a ceiling. We conservatively project =
potential 2005 and 2006 targets of $1.50 and $3+ respectively. =
We first recommended an initial accumulation under $.78. When =
the market opportunity presented itself, we added buys under =
=2E38, under .31, and at .10.=0D=0A=0D=0A =0D=0A=0D=0AThe Seasoned =
