Don't we need to have our meeting first?. . The four of us should still meet asap and agree on paper with PG&E and present this to them.

They never made it up here Tuesday.  I spoke to Ray Tuesday and we said we would reschedule after a few days.  I'll call today and maybe we'll set up a video conference.
