Todd -

Just to recap from our meeting this morning.

Discussion Points
1.	The following personnel are familiar with the batch module
architecture:  Ress Young, Dickson Koo, and Rogers Herndon.
2.	On the IT side, the following personnel can assist with data
extraction/description from RPS:  Charles Alvarez (*main contact), Ed
Calderon, Scott Yergin.
3.	On the Origination side, Phil Laden is familiar with the creation of
batch modules.

Action Items
1. (Todd Taylor)  We should expect a listing of all the available data for
extract from RPS.  This list should be sent to all of the parties on this
email by end of day Friday.
2. (Power Team)  We will redefine the RPS extract list, including the
information reviewed in #1 and that discussed in our meeting this morning.
The data dump will be delivered at the latest Wednesday, but our target is
today.  Please send it in ZIP format to limit the size of the email.  Again,
please copy all of the parties on this email.  The redefined extraction list
will include the current listing of fields, plus information regarding the
following.  (Should Annie, Erin, and Steven finalize this request, and
forward it to you via email?)
	- penalty parameters
	- actual and contractual max/min usage amounts
	- the financial instrument of the deal
	- records for multiple utilities at one site, plus an indicator of
this for such records
	- the RPS unique identifier
	- the name of the curve used to mark the deal to market
	- rate combo ID
	- aggregation level of MWH ON/OFF, pvMWH ON/OFF, and MW ON/OFF
values
3. (Power Team)  We will contact Dickson Koo for a meeting to discuss the
batch modules.  This will allow us to understand what all the calculations
and details are that are uploaded to the RPS system, in addition to
providing for us some take-away copies of the batch modules.
4. (Power Team)  We will establish a protocol for backing up the Access
database on a daily (M-F) basis to the KPMG server.
