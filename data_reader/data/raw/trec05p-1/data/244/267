                                        Perhaps one of the most interesting announcements has been BP&#39;s decision to pull out of the political financing game.  While it doesn&#39;t directly affect the issues that Eyeforenergy generally covers, it does highlight an interesting issue the role of governments in the energy industry.  The recent Supreme Court ruling in the US on FERC&#39;s authority in the energy markets, the EU&#39;s push to legislate emissions reductions programs, the increasing deregulation of the energy markets across the globe all reflect an industry truly in a state of flux.  And while much of what is driving the changes in the industry is based on businesses searching out new revenue, many of the rules of the game are still being defined by governments.  Eyeforenergy will be keeping a close eye on the latest developments and what they mean for the industry, and most importantly what sort of opportunities they create.
<p>
But first, this week&#39;s briefing takes a look at a set of economic drivers in the energy industry -- the convergence of energy, weather and emissions trading.  As we&#39;ve learned from our recent conferences in Amsterdam and from doing research for our upcoming Emissions and Energy Trading events in the States, these three commodities have a lot more in common that meets the eye.  As everyone from Congress, to Moody&#39;s to the lawyers debate about what caused the Enron disaster and who to blame for it, we thought we&#39;d take a look at what it&#39;s meant for the commodity markets and the traders.  It&#39;s been an interesting discovery and has led to a few surprises.  While much of the buzz has been about the tightening financial outlook for many of the energy trading operations and the renewed importance (or perhaps better put, the belated discovery of the true importance) of counterparty risk, we&#39;ve found that the online energy trading market still has a lot of life left in it yet, and may soon get big boosts from the increasing development of the emissions and weather markets.

Energy Management has never been more important than today. As the energy sector continues to deregulate, energy managers are finding themselves increasingly faced with new players, new tools and new choices. A solid strategy which can navigate the challenges of intense competition, online developments and a volatile market supply, is crucial to your business.
<p>
Where can you go to network with the important players in the field? Where can you get expert appraisal of your energy strategy? Where can you find out about the latest tools that can make your operations more efficient and more secure? The answer is Philadelphia this June at the Strategic Energy Management USA conference and exhibition.
