I am putting together a comprehensive contact list, but in the interim I wanted to flag two contacts for you to tuck away in your pocket.  I have met and spent time with the CEO of S&P.  I know him through Michael Lewan, one of our DC consultants.  You may know of that S&P is owned by McGraw Hill.  Michael Lewan gave the "Steve Kean" (and #3) of McGraw Hill his very first job in life.  Glenn then introduced me to the CEO of S&P, Leo O'Neill.  Leo is a very approachable person who readily made acquaintances with me b/c of his great fondness for Bob Rubin and Michael Lewan.  Leo told me several stories of how he always "thinks better of" the CEOs who sit down with him and engage in honest conversation when S&P is evaluating its ratings of a company.  That is how Leo got to know Bob; Leo was very impressed with how Bob acted when S&P was contemplating action against Goldman Sachs many years ago.  Second, the recently resigned Head of Enforcement of the SEC is a friend from my gym.  For several years I spent most mornings with him as we shared the same personal trainer.  I am sure Richard hired most if not all of the current SEC enforcement staff.  I am not sure where Richard landed upon his departure, as he wanted to just take time off before starting his next career.  These two contacts are small, but thought you might want to include them in your thinking.  Hope all is well.
