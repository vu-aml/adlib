The following volumes are capacities west of Station 1 that will result from tie-in construction work slated for the Red Rock expansion.  Tie-in assemblies will be required on both the Mainline and Loopline at stations 1, 2, and 3.  New block and side valve assemblies for new compressor and scrubbers will be installed on the suction side main and loop lines at each station.  The tie-in will entail blocking (isolating) a line segment within the station yard on the suction side (each line done separately) thus creating a dead leg back to the next upstream block valve crossover(s).  Hence, all of the flow will be forced into a single line when making tie-in on the adjacent pipeline line.  The result of forcing all volumes into a single line will produce greater pressure losses in the operating segment to the existing compression and reduce throughput due to lower suction pressure and respective horsepower limitations.  Discharge piping at the station having tie-in work will be unchanged regarding valving configurations.

Notes:
1.	Specific schedule dates are forthcoming
2.	Schedules could be impacted by material deliveries and is based upon receipt of construction permits
3.	Durations consider working around the clock until completed
