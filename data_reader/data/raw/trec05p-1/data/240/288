Stan................just a reminder to follow up with the commercial group regarding the question about gas going off the system.  While we have capacity, the field doesn't see much happening to bring customers back or to get new customers.  There was also the issue of better communication between the commercial group and the field.  They specifically mentioned a situation with ONEOK.  The customer told the field employees that ETS was releasing gas to them, not our commercial group.

Again...............you did an outstanding job yesterday.
