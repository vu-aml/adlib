Louise,

Attached is the list of Top 50 counterparties. 

As mentioned in my prior emails, and mentioned by credit in our meeting this morning:

Credit have a list (the one you previously supplied), but have been frustrated in that the list shows only group names and does not show the specific legal entities within the group name whom we need to approve (e.g. Aquila Risk Management Corp vs. Aquilla Capital and Trade). 

Attached is a list which we put together which was taken from the Top 50 Power and Top 50 Gas customer lists, based on online transactions.

Further work needs to be done to add back the actual power ranking and prioritise based on total value of business between both gas and power, and to prioritise the sub-entities, but this should give you an idea of what we hope to have ready to send to credit tomorrow.

I'm trying to reconcile how giving them this list helps at this late stage, but they have requested it, so I intend to provide it tomorrow, unless you have any objections.

Dave

Added all of Louise's counterparties except  for a couple for which we did no trade on eol with that specific entity- i.e. JP Morgan Chase continued to trade on EOL as The Chase Manhattan Bank.
