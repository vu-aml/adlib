Louise,

I understand that there's a lot of discussion going on about the approach to organizing our technical resources.  I would appreciate the opportunity to provide input to that process.

You don't know much about me, but I have been with Enron for over eleven years.  I was hired Enron Power Corp. as Project Engineering Manager for the Teesside project, was promoted to General Manager of Engineering concurrently with being Teesside PEM, and built up the engineering group there.  I moved into front end development support and have worked on development projects in Mexico, South America, the Middle East and Europe.  A little over three years ago I was assigned to support ENA efforts and I was intimately involved in the 99 peakers on.  Last November I transitioned my EE&CC development engineering group from EE&CC to ENA as part of the Technical Services group.

All of the above is only to say that I have pretty broad exposure to the overall organization.  I know a lot of the people, a lot of the history and I a little about how this machine seems to work.  I would be happy to give my perspective on the issues if it is any value to you.  Although I should provide truth in advertising and warn you that I am pretty direct and have fairly definitive opinions on most subjects.  In other words, my opinion is way too easy to get.

If I can add anything to the process, please let me know.

Mike Coleman
