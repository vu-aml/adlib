Hello, 

     Have you got soap? Take a comb and a towel. Got handkerchie
their bows  slung  going along  the road. He  saw the  lick  by t
that we were only about three miles from the salt and had no desi
language.
for him to go down for meat.
     Well, whoever it was put it on us. 
had sounded too much like the name of a state for a long time, an
dying pig. I understood finally: he was asking if we had one of t
country broken  up instead of the plains, and I was completely  h
was no rapid fire, no pouring it on him as he comes groggy into t
alone and not rattle  him, I said. Its hell  for him to shoot 
     Droopy  didnt know  but the  spearman said it was very roug
sable.
     MCola has been doing that with you too?
alongside, Kamau, the driver, put the lights on.

Have a nice day.
