Attached are two press releases:

1) Agreed to settlement of the EXXON-Mobil Pipeline
explosion in Abilene, and

2) A press release by Charles Matthews on the
confidentiality of tariff filings.  You will remember
this is an issue which was aired during the
discussions/creation of the Code of Conduct.  We think
it is being driven by TIPRO since Roger Plank (Apache)
is the current TIPRO president.  The Association's
State Regulatory Affairs Committee will be discussing
this issue next week.  We are awaiting the finalized
copy of the proposed rules with Commissioner Matthews'
request for public comment.  We will disseminate the
proposal by email as soon as we receive it.

Also attached is a list of charges delegated by the
Speaker of the Texas House to the Committee on Energy
for interim study.

Sincerely,

Patrick J. Nugent
Executive Director
512/478-2871
