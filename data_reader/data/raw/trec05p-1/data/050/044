Rob, I have already spoke with Paul and told him of the opportunities we have in Toronto.  He seemed very interested and it was left in his camp to contact me after thinking through his options (Calgary and staying in the UK).  Louise, you sent the E-mail to Derek Davies. Does Paul want a follow up from Derek as to Alberta options??

I will call him today to touch base anyway, but if possible please clarify....

Cheers, Paul D

Paul Goddard is a manager in the London office looking to come home to Canada (Calgary or Toronto) and has spoken to Paul in Toronto.  Paul is a strong manager who has been in the organisation for several years.  I know that Paul has a position offer in Dynegy (from Pope obviously).  I think that it would be good for you to have a chat with him to see if there is a fit as I wouldn't want to lose him.  At the moment, he seems very keen on Toronto and working in power retail - he definitely doesn't want to leave Enron.

His number is +44 7748 932298

Thanks

Louise
