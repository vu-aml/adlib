Investment ideas

1. INVESTMENTOR
Stealthy superstars of telecom
The three worst international telco equipment companies--or are 
they?

By Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist

Perhaps it's the Scrooge in me, but for this holiday column let's 
focus not on attractive or highly rated stocks--where, let's face it, 
opinions can vary--but on the stinkers, the lemons of international 
telecom equipment companies that you'd have to be crazy to bet 
your money on.

Or would you?

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
All eyes on Cisco (CSCO)
A plethora of smaller companies are nipping at its heels, but all they may 
get is bone

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

What do Juniper Networks (JNPR), Foundry Networks (FDRY), 
Extreme Networks (EXTR) and Riverstone Networks (RSTN) have in 
common? They all sport a market capitalization in excess of $1 billion 
(despite the massive tech sell-off of the last 18 months), and they all toil 
in the looming shadow of Cisco Systems (CSCO). 

Although growth investors continually check the pulse of these other 
tech upstarts, they can't do research in a vacuum. As goes Cisco, so goes 
these networkers. 

To be sure, these companies can try and wrest a few points of market 
share from Cisco. But if the market for switches and routers doesn't 
rebound sharply, share gains will result in only a minor revenue uptick. 
And no one has greater visibility into the direction of the networking 
market than Cisco. So when Cisco CEO John Chambers speaks, the 
sector listens.
