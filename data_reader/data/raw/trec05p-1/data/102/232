Confidential and urgent From Mr. Valentine Johnson:

Dear Sir/Madam,

URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL.

Please do not be offended if I have invaded your privacy. I am Mr. Valentine Johnson, I am contacting you on a business transaction involving a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.

PROPOSITION.
I was the accounts officer to Mr. Selah Adams (deceased) one of our foreign customers. While he banked with us, I oversaw his accounts and other official/financial obligations as my office demanded being his accounts officer, unfortunately, he died along with his entire family in the plane crash of 31 October, 1999 on board the Egyptian Airline 990 alongside other passengers.  While he was alive, none of his family members was ever known to me other than his immediate nuclear family. Since his death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has contacted the bank to make claim to this money. I cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking regulations. 

Having made a very franatic and exhaustive search for any family member that would lay claim to this fund, I have decided to take my chance with you. I now seek your permission to have you stand as next of kin to the deceased as I have all documentations including his certified Death Certificate that will facilitate your stand as next of kin to him as he had a closing balance of £5,500,000.00lbs (five million, five hundred thousand pounds sterling) here in our bank in London. I also have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any member of the deceased family member to become beneficiary of this fund. Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavour by
furnishing me with the following via E-mail.
 
1. Full Names
2. Beneficiary name and address
3. Direct Telephone and fax numbers

These process will enable us make some internal re-adjustments and effect the change of beneficiary within the bank making you the next of kin, this before now was left blank by the deceased upon opening of the account six years ago. Upon your reply to this email, I will give you more information. I am also assuring you that this transaction is 100% risk free on your part and it is a project that has been carefully and logically worked out for a successful execution. I solicit your interest and trust in this proposal as I await your response. 

Regards,

Mr. Valentine Johnson
