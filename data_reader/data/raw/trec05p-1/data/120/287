Jim-

We are working very hard to have an operational and reliable EDI environment in New York. So far, we are covering the three main billing scenarios (UDC-bill ready, UDC-rate ready and ESCO-bill ready) that we may choose and switch as needed. EDI billing is not ready yet but we expect having it implemented (testing included) at the most by May 2002. I'll keep you posted on the latest developments. Let me know if you need any questions. Thanks, Vinio

We need to ensure that the EDI rules are final and allow Enron to switch billing options early next year (see #2 below).  Let me know if there are any issues.

The deposit will be in the form of a cash deposit, wired into ConEd's Chase Manhattan Bank today. I am working with ConEd to agree on the applicable interest rate.

We can dispute ConEd's data. However, I do not think this is a good time to do so because:
1. Unlike our calc, the ConEd calc is based on the summer peak for the customers (even when we factor that in, I think that the volumes used in ConEd's calc may still be too high - but I intend to raise that issue at a later time)
2. The number of customers EES has contracted as at today (6000 - unknown to ConEd), and who will soon be enrolled with ConEd makes any argument unecessary. Per the UBP rules, if the volumes increase by 10%, ConEd is entitled to request an increase in the deposit amount. Whenever they come back to us for more, we will dispute their data and hopefully reduce the dollar amount and/or at least buy ourselves more time. More time is important, as the EDI rules in NY will be complete first quater of next year. At that time, EES will change its billing option, the security requirement will be unecessary, and our deposit will be returned to us with interest.
3. I had negotiated with ConEd to suspend their billing cycle on our customers to give us time to work through this issue. This has revenue implications for them. Disputing their numbers will appear as a gimmick, would generate bad will, and will frustrate our future negotiations/relationship with them 

I will provide an update later in the day.

Thanks,
Gloria

I was told Bradford would, "release the $1 million tomorrow."  I don't know what form.  I will find out.  

Also, regarding the usage - I do not know the answer.  Our numbers are systematically scraped directly off the ConEd website by account - I do not believe that any errors in this process could be consistently that low.  We pull actual data and site profile normalizes and calendarizes the data - Jeff probably is using the normalized info.  ConEd is likely using a design peak to maximize the deposit and ensure that even if we fail under design conditions they have sufficient security.  We could potentially use our data (their web data) to dispute their own calculation.

Gloria - can we dispute ConEd's calc based on the data we took from the website?  How tight is the approved deposit provision?

FYI. What form of security did we post the $1million? How does this amount change over time? Why do you think Con-Ed's consumption estimates are so different than ours?

Gloria,

The analysis performed by ConEd is based only on mass market customers with October start dates.  Looking at this set of customers, ConEd has estimated significantly higher consumption for our customers than Origination has calculated.  This is shown below, with the credit requirement calculated for 45 days during the summer peak.

			ConEd Calculation				Calculation using Origination Values
# of accounts		1,395						1,395
Peak Month MWh	8,993						5,694
Peak Month $		$539,616					$341,653

Electric 45 Day $	$809,424					$512,479
Nat Gas 45 Day $	$183,195					$183,195
Total 45 Day $		$992,620					$695,674       Difference $296,946

Extrapolating these figures out for all mass market customers signed as of today (6,000) with start dates between October and January, the credit requirements would be as follows:

			ConEd Calculation Extrapolated		Calculation using Origination Values
# of accounts		6,000						6,000
Peak Month MWh	38,681						29,232
Peak Month $		$2,320,930					$1,753,920

Electric 45 Day $	$3,481,395					$2,630,880
Nat Gas 45 Day $	$   787,936					$   787,936
Total 45 Day $		$4,269,331					$3,226,321    Difference $1,023,010

Using either calculation shows that are security requirement will very quickly be much higher than the $1 million currently being requested.  These values do not include additional mass market origination or the switching of existing financially served customers to physical service.  The conversion of existing financially served customers to physical service could easily add another $2 million.  

RAC needs to be aware that the $1 million will be a temporary fix and that the value will be much higher in the near future.

Thanks,
Jeff

Gloria,
As requested.  The method by which the $1 million security requirement for
agency billing on Enron Energy Services' current population is explained
below.  This is a consistent approach at calculating security requirements
for agency billing for ESCOs participating in our service territory.  If you
have questions, please let me know.  Thanks.
