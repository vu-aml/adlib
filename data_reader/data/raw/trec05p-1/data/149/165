Rick, I had Legal (Steve Hall) look over the document and he was ok with it and thought it was quite a good deal.  I will try to get it finalized this afternoon.  The other significant CA items are Seabron Adamson's estimates; the first one was $25k and the second totals $167k (through issue 1).  Should I try to pin him down and cap the second estimate?  We have pending invoices from him for $25k (relating to the first estimate) and $82k and $5k relating to the second.  Ray

Rick, please advise if I should proceed with finalizing the $200k fixed fee arrangement with Bracewell to carry us through the end of the CA proceeding.  (FYI we have an approximately $90k invoice pending that should be covered within the arrangement).  Thanks.  Ray
