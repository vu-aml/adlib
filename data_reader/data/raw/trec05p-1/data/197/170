We have a "bug" in Sitara when multiple global counterparty rows (Sitara portfolios and Tagg books) have the same COUNTERPARTY_LEGAL_NM.
We are currently not doing any code enhancement.
Until we get over this hump, we would appreciate your assistance in ensuring that duplicat names are avoided.

Thanks
