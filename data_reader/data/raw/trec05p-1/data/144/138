Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2819&key=1645&"><B>Priest Holmes</B></A>, RB KC - Not So Nice Machine <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday, which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against the Jets in Week Nine.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2819&key=1599&"><B>Trent Green</B></A>, QB KC !

 SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>McCardell matches up with Duane Starks in Sunday's game against Baltimore, and that, combined with the possibility of Jonathan Quinn starting at quarterback, makes him a risky start. McCardell has the talent to beat Starks for a few good catches, but you shouldn't be counting on him for explosive stats.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2819&key=1236&"><B>Jimmy Smith</B></A>, WR JAC - North Blvd Nutwhackers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you have to keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league.
