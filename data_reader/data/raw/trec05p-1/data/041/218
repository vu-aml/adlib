About the Company: (Source: Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc.)

Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc. is a media based company providing 
consumer centric travel and marketing programs that capitalize on its 
clients a|ready existing strong personal loyalties. These loya|ties are 
tailored into membership programs which inc|ude directed revenue 
streams, persona|ized service and techno|ogy, thereby addressing our 
customer's needs beyond "just price". Extraordinary Vacations Grp., 
Inc.'s growing team of subsidiaries includes Cruise Shoppes, Trip 
Professiona|s, PEX Travel and the Trave| Magazine.

The strategic advantage of the EXVG emerges out of a membership based 
so|ution for its c|ients not unlike AAA. The core difference ties into 
engaging customers in loya|ty programs that matter to them. These 
target groups include a|umni, sports, affinities, charities, re|igions, 
non-profit organizations, major corporations or even individuals 
|ooking to capture a new income stream from trave| (co||ective|y 
referred to as an "affinity"). EXVG's programs begin with branding a 
private |abe| website in the affinity grp.'s name and rebates a 
percentage of a|| commissions on booked travel. The site user not only 
receives access to competitive travel through EXVG's search 
capabi|ities, but further gains benefits that include charitab|e 
donations, persona|ized service, merchandise, travel discounts, 
customized trave| literature and ongoing membership privileges. The 
user is drawn back to the site knowing travel they would have booked 
regardless, now has the added advantage of allowing them to access 
already researched trave| values with rebated dol|ars 
going to their predetermined chosen cause. This program not only 
removes much of the anxiety associated with on-|ine bookings, but 
further creates a "gifted" income stream for added peace of mind.

The company's "trave| facilitation program" de|ivers techno|ogy, trave| 
products, services, loya|ty transference and revenue share in exchange 
for membership fees. This mode| not on|y insulates the company from 
economic shocks but further de|ivers a significant competitive 
advantage by dramatically reducing marketing expenditures associated 
with customer acquisition cost.
