Last night our main 'Server' failed, and we have been working since to restore service.
 
It looks like we lost NO data
 
For the time, you cannot get to your H:, P:, W:, R: (Local Drives)
 
I have no ETA.
 
You will have trouble starting some programs.
 
Terminal Server is UNAFFECTED:
 
Houston Based Data is UNAFFECTED:
 
I will follow up with more news / details later
 
Victor and Paul are available to help get you with anything we can.
 
Thank you for your patience
 
Dave
