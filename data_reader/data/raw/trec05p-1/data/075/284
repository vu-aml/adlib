Steve:

Per your request, we've reset your password to "password".  Your user id to
Enron Forum remains your email address which we have as 'skean@enron.com'.
Anecdotes from participants and the evaluation forms we have received thus
far show that Enron's initiative in hosting 'US Energy Policy at a
Crossroad' was very well received.   Enjoyed working with you at the October
event and look forward to the next one.  Let me know if you need anything
further.

Kind regards,
