Dear Member,

It has been more than a month since the tragic events of 
September 11.  And I want to express my personal 
appreciation to the many thousands of readers from around 
the world who have sent in words of sympathy to the people 
of this country and in particular of New York City.  The 
New York Times on the Web has kept open the area reserved 
for these messages, and you are free to read them on our 
site.

http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/19/national/ATTFORUM.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041E5s041ECU42_r6012000mdf2Mdf2y

The unfolding developments on the military and public 
health areas are covered in great depth by the Times' 
staff of reporters and editors. To make it easier to catch 
up on the past six weeks of coverage, we have created a 
special section on the Web called "A Nation Challenged." 
This includes a day-by-day rundown of events as well as an 
archive of past coverage. 

http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/dayofterror/index.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041E5g041ECU42_r6012000mdf2Mdf2y

With so many correspondents involved in coverage of this 
crisis, we felt it might illuminate some of the background 
to these stories to have conversations with many of them. 
You can listen to conversations with such veteran 
correspondents as R.W. Apple, John F. Burns, David Sanger, 
Judith Miller, and many others.

In a further effort to provide some unusual background to 
the situation, Vincent Laforet, a New York Times staff 
photographer, gives a first person account of being among 
the refugees in Pakistan in "Photographer's Journal," a personal 
multimedia essay.   His photos explore refugees piecing 
together a Koran, spending time in an opium den and living 
in a Pakistani school. Vincent accompanies the essay with 
an audio description.

I have to confess to being a fervent New York Yankees fan, 
going back to my childhood as a boy in the Bronx. Many New 
Yorkers got a tremendous lift by the Yankees' comeback 
against a very strong Oakland Athletics team. By the time 
you read this you may know whether the Yankees won or lost 
against the Seattle Mariners in the championship series 
leading up to the World Series.
