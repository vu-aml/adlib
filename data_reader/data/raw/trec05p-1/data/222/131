 	  	 Dear Andrew,

In the wake of Enron's downfall, the Senate Energy Committee is taking a second look at the Public Utility Holding Company Act. On Wednesday, the Committee will hold a hearing on the PUHCA and our Washington bureau will bring us the latest. 

With talk of possible criminal activities in Enron's trading division, many are wondering what liabilities UBS Warburg could face. On Wednesday from the Houston bureau, we'll talk with former U.S. Attorney and Porter and Hedges Partner Dan Hedges about problems that could arise for UBS Warburg. 

Haynes and Boone, LLP Attorney Larry Pascal talks about how Argentina's economic crisis is affecting the energy industry. We'll have details on the disarray in Argentina from the Houston bureau on Wednesday. 

On the West Coast, ENL's Kym McNicholas will speak with Saber Partners CEO Joseph Fichera on Wednesday. Fichera says there are some serious issues being overlooked in regard to the CPUC's rate agreement with the CDWR. Fichera will share his concerns during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow. 

Also on Wednesday, Kym says she'll have more on the California Senate Energy Committee's hearing on the Independent Systems Operators' Market Design Plan for 2002. Members of the committee say they have serious doubts about the ISO's ability to enforce market rules going forward. 

We'll also talk with Hydrogenics President and CEO Pierre Rivard on Wednesday. Rivard will join us from the NASDAQ during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast to discuss hydrogen fuel cell technology.
