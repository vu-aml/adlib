In a section of the will written on March 5, 1982, nearly a year after the
assassination bid, he makes a reference to his "place of funeral."

I know it's bad form to address you by your Christian name when we've never
formally met. But "Mrs. Parker Bowles" seems so formal. After all, I've read
so much about you (and of course listened to that saucy "Camillagate" tape)
that I feel I know you. At least well enough for a little woman-to-woman
chat.
