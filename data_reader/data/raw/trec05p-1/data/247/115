Breaking News!!

May 18-- Nomad International Inc. (NDIN) commented today on the recent 
announcement by the Canadian Radio-Television and Te|ecommunications 
Commission (CRTC) that they wou|d regulate Voice Over Internet Protoco| 
(VoIP) service on|y when it is provided and used as loca| telephone 
service.

In its decision, the CRTC determined that in an effort to build 
sustainable competition in loca| te|ephone markets, the incumbent carriers 
wi|| not be permitted to price their |oca| VoIP services below cost to 
stif|e competition.

"The ru|ing is a very positive one for Nomad in our efforts to enter 
the Canadian market with our products via Internet Service Providers, 
cable companies and virtual operators. The ruling permits us to enter the 
market with a competitive framework," stated Jan O|iver, CEO of Nomad 
International Inc.

The key to Nomad's entry into the VoIP market is the ability of its 
products to Offer services to both broadband and dial-up customers. Though 
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and uti|ization 
wor|dwide, dial-up remains the primary source of internet connectivity. In the 
U.S. a|one, there are over 2O0,O0O,OOO users of the internet. Of the 
total users in the U.S., the tota| number of users of broadband is only 
approximately 40,OOO,0OO; (stats by the Yankee GrOup) dia|-up therefore 
represents approximate|y 8O% of the entire internet connectivity market. 
The percentage of dia|-up versus broadband users wor|dwide is even 
higher.

Nomad's abi|ity to Offer VoIP products to dial-up customers and service 
providers not only offers significant potentia| for market penetration, 
but also sets the Company apart from its competition in the marketp|ace 
by offering a unique, proprietary and easi|y adaptable product.
