Action Plan
Halt all recruiting efforts
Rescind offers with start dates thru end of February 2002
No change (as of now) with offers starting Summer 2002
Complete several internal transfers into program - stop all future internal transfers into program
Immediately cut 4 and 5 rated Associates and Analysts
Reduce remainder of group consistent with commercial organizations
Roll A/A program into HR reporting to David Oxley
Reduce administrative staff significantly

Current Program
