In order for the estate to determine possible future WARN obligations, it is important that we have a predicted estimate of the number of employees that may be identified as RIF, in the next 90 days (i.e.. between now and April 14th).

This information is critical as it is part of a legal discussion on the estate's future financial obligations and clearly WARN may affect those. If you're not sure of the exact numbers, then please give us the spread e.g. 150-250, and an approximate date when you think this RIF will occur.

Please let Robert know (and cc me & Kalen) the estimated numbers, dates and BU's by close of business on Tuesday.

Thanks

Tim
