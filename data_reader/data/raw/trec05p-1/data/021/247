Attached is a revised draft of a letter as we would like to see it from Oneok, which includes changes from the draft Michelle and I crafted on Friday.  While we don't intend to provide this draft to Oneok, it will enable us to assist them if they ask for drafting suggestions (they will more than likely be on a short time fuse).  Please let me know if either of you has any comments...................Tony
