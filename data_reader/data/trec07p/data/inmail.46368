Very hard to read for those of us involved with trying to improve access to needed cancer care, including blood & marrow transplants, for underserved populations. Not only are there  severe disparities in the existing donor pool ( needed as only 25% of patients find a donor in their biological family) but often there is no coverage, or too-limited coverage, for donor testing.  Feel free to contact me for more info on  equity issues int he BMT field.

A Genetic Test for the Dogs

http://www.fhcrc.org/about/pubs/center_news/2007/may/art2.html

Curious about the ancestry of your mixed-breed dog? This summer, Mars
Inc. will launch a dog-DNA test developed by former Center researchers
Drs. Elaine Ostrander and Leonid Krugylak. The Wisdom Panel MX could
become one of the Center's biggest licensing deals to date.
<snip>

Given that more than 3 million mixed-breed dogs are born every year in
the United States, they calculated a possible annual market of $75
million, Weissman said.
<snip>

How research on the genetics behind cancers common to dogs and humans
became a commercial breed-test product is itself a unique story of
technology transfer at the Center. The process from bench to dog
bedside was relatively fast and has already proven profitable to the
Center.

"the Center" refers to Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle
