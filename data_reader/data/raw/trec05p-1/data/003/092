Gerald,

Here are the templates that Shawna left.  I am not sure if any of these will be sufficient as a Master for wellhead gas. We can talk about it further once you have a chance to look it over and discuss it with Jeff Hodge.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Judy

Attached are the following forms for ENA Upstream Company, LLC to use for wellhead purchases. They can be found in my directory-s.flynn under ENA UPSTREAM FORMS. I can be reached on my cell phone for the next few weeks (713)306-2926 or leave a message in my voice mail at Enron ext.34891. It really has been a pleasure working with all of you and I wish you all the best. Take care-Shawna
