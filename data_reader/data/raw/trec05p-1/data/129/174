I do not see these deals in Enpower.  I also do not see where we bought power for TECO in the P&L or Enpower.  Could you look into this for me?  I will be out Friday and all of next week, so if you could let Jeff Miller or Kayla Harmon know what needs to be done I would appreciate it.  Have a good Thanksgiving.

Thanks,
Laurel

John/Laurel,

I worked the nights of the 22, 23 and 24th, but I dont remember these trades.
I even double checked my trading log, but once again, no trades.

You might want to check with Steve as these are during the day shift when he worked.
