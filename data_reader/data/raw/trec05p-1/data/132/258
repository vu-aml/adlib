Bill,

Attached is worksheet that provides some comparables of the USGT volumes that flowed west.  In the scheme of things, the volumes in question our not that significant.

Look at the "comparables" page of the excel file.  This missing section should be given to you by Dennis Lee on Monday.

I'm out next week but I should be available by cell phone or my home phone (713)665-4026.
