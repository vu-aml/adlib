SACRAMENTO - Hundreds of local fire crews that saved homes from being

destroyed by wildfire this week are returning home today, after being

released by the Governor's Office of Emergency Services. State OES
engines will remain behind to finish what is hoped to be the final
stages of this month's wildfire fight. 

Today, with the fires nearing full containment, OES began sending
home local government engines from the Creek and North Fork fires.
Crews from the Leonard Fire will begin heading home tomorrow. The 261

engines will continue to depart the scene in parades of five,
scattered throughout the next several days, passing back across the
freeways to the 51 counties from which they came (see attachment). 

Of the nine large wildfires that started this month, it was the Creek

Fire, currently 85 percent contained, that dominated local government

and State OES Mutual Aid resources. For six days, the Creek Fire
roared across Tuolumne and Mariposa counties blackening 11,500 acres
and threatening to engulf homes in numerous communities. At its peak
deployment yesterday, OES had 260 engines and eight National Guard
helicopters on the fires.

Among its duties, State OES dispatches local government and state
fire fighting resources through the California Fire & Rescue Mutual
Aid System. The neighbor-helping-neighbor system is designed to
assist the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection,
federal wildland fire agencies, and local departments. It is also
ensures that additional resources are provided to local jurisdictions

whenever their resources are committed or insufficient for a fire.

The OES Fire and Rescue Emergency Operations Center in Sacramento
will remain activated 24-hours a day to coordinate statewide fire and

rescue efforts. At the center are representatives from OES Executive
Office, Law Enforcement Branch, Inland Region, and the California
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
