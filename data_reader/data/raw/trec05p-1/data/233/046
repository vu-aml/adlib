The best thing to do with the best things in life is to give them up. http://www.wehiuhef.com/ We always take credit for the good and attribute the bad to fortune. Empty pockets never held anyone back. Only empty heads and empty hearts can do that.


to get out please read on page above Every action we take, everything we do, is either a victory or defeat in the struggle to become what we want to be. Well begun is half done.
