Hello,

We tried contacting you awhile ago about your low interest mortage rate.
You have qualified for the lowest rate in years.
You could get over $300,000 for as little as $600 a month!
Bad credit? Doesn't matter, low rates are fixed no matter what!

To get a free, no obligation consultation click below:

Best Regards,
John Bryant
