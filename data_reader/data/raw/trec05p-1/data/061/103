I tried to submit my question via eSpeak however I received the following message "The system was unable to process your request.  The information you submitted may be in error."  Since I was unable to submit my question via eSpeak I thought I'd send my question to you directly.  

I'd like to begin by welcoming you back.  Although Enron has some experienced difficult times during the past year I know that you will help lead us and obtain our goal of being the world's leading company.  

Secondly, I wanted to bring to your attention a matter that concerns me a great deal.  A close personal friend of mine who works at Enron and lives in an outlying area of Houston has been commuting to work in what I would consider a risky manner.  What she does and from what I understand its a common practice among Enron employees as well as others who work downtown is pick up riders from the park & ride lots so that she can get on the HOV lane.  People from what I understand literally line up and cars drive up and pick up passengers.  It goes without saying that the majority of the time the drivers do not know who they are picking up or vice-versa.  This is the part that concerns me.  I'm sure that most of the people that do this are good people and have no bad intentions and are simply trying to save time and maybe even get a little extra sleep.   However, what concerns me is eventually I think someone who has bad intentions will come along and I don't want anything to happen to my friend or anyone else for that matter.  I'd like to see if there is something that Enron can do so that our co-workers, friends, and loved ones can commute to downtown in a manner that isn't so risky.  I have told my friend that this isn't a safe practice but unfortunately it has fallen on deaf ears and would at least like to try an come up with an alternative for her.  

The only alternative I could come up with is if Enron formed a voluntary list of Enron employees who live in the same area and commute to downtown in this manner so that they can car-pool in together.  I know some people might say that this isn't an Enron issue but I think it is because several Enron employees commute to downtown in this manner.  

This months tragic events made me realize that sometimes we place too much of an emphasis on things that really don't matter and to focus on the things that do.  I just want to try and make sure that nothing happens to my friend.  Thank you for your time and once again welcome back.  

Thanks.
Richard
