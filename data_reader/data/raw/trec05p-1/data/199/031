You are in the New York Times today, page C6.  Can't tell if it's good or bad cuz I don't understand business jargon.  I'm about to go for a little run.  It's beautiful out.  Met a new professor today, Russian but nice.  Ready for summer vacation already!  At least we have a three day weekend.  Hope you're having a good day.

Cheers,
Jules
