YOUR KIND ATTANETION:
PLEASE REPLY TO: hsbc@smygis.com
My name is Sharon Thompson; I work with the Phillips Consulting Firm in
London.We are conducting a standard process investigation involving a
client who shares the same name with you and also the circumstances
surrounding investments made by this client at HSBC Bank Plc. The HSBC
Private Banking client died interstate and nominated no next of kin to
inherit the title over the investments made with HSBC Bank Plc. The essence
of this communication with you is to request that you provide us
information on three issues:

1-Are you aware of any relative/relation having the same surname, whose
last known contact address was Brussels Belgium?
2-Are you aware of any investment of considerable value made by such a
person at the HSBC Bank Plc.?
3-Can you establish beyond reasonable doubt your eligibility to assume
status of next of kin to the deceased?

It is pertinent that you inform us ASAP whether or not you are familiar
with this personality that we may put an end to this communication with
you and our inquiries surrounding this personality.You must appreciate
that we are constrained from providing you with more detailed
information at this point. Please respond to this mail as soon as possible to
afford us the opportunity to close this investigation.
Thank you for accommodating our enquiry.
PLEASE REPLY TO: hsbc@smygis.com
Yours sincerely,
Ms Sharon Thompson.
