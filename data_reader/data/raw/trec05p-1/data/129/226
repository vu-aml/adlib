John,

If you need room in your special "Top 50 Bonus" and if you think we will have bonuses under the ordinary program there is no need to include Mike Mcdonald and Steve Thome right now.   I spoke with both of them last night and for different reasons I dont think they will revolt anytime soon.   The other guys are being bid by competition and/or they have checked with lawyers about their contracts:

Choi - 200
Rosman - 200
Parquet - 250
Thomas - 300

This implies a cash plus equity structure.  This deals with them till 1/31 after which we will need a clear 2002 bonus and retention program.
