It&#146;s designed to help investors track the total return of the Schwab 1000 Index&#174;.  The index includes 1,000 large- and mid-cap stocks and will typically represent between 85% and 90% of the total value of all U.S. stocks.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Not only does the Schwab 1000 Fund provide investors with broad exposure to companies in many different industries and of many different sizes, but part of its stated strategy is to consider the tax consequences of its investment decisions in an effort to help reduce the tax burden on its shareholders. It&#146;s a strategy that seems to have paid off.</font></P>

      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><i>The Schwab 1000 Index&#174; includes common stocks of the 1,000 largest publicly traded companies as measured by market capitalization. It does not include privately held companies, investment companies or companies incorporated outside the United States. Unlike fund returns, indices do not reflect any fee or expense deductions and cannot be invested in directly.</i></font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">* Investor shares, with operating expenses of 0.46%, require a $2,500 minimum initial investment. Select Shares, with operating expenses of 0.35%, require a minimum initial investment of $50,000. The fund charges a redemption fee of 0.75% for shares sold within 180 days of purchase. The expense ratio reflects a voluntary reduction by Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (CSIM) and Schwab, which is guaranteed through at least February 28, 2002.</font></P>
