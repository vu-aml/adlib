RE:  CLAY BASIN INTERRUPTIBLE STORAGE SERVICE

Effective for gas day November 28, 2001, Questar Pipeline Company (Questar) will allow injections up to an additional 1,000,000 Dth of interruptible storage service at Clay Basin (see critical notice #1383 for original 1,000,000 Dth).  However, Questar will NOT allow gas quantities in FSS to be transferred to ISS.  

If you have questions, please contact your Questar Customer Service representative or call (801) 324-2117.
