Great restaurants, shopping, historical attractions, and more. Take a Fan Fare trip from delta.com and explore a city you might not otherwise visit. 

Salt Lake City
The Winter Olympics are over, but spring is a fantastic time to visit this cosmopolitan city nestled in the Wasatch Mountains. Whether you're interested in immersing yourself in nature, the arts or history, Salt Lake City is the perfect destination this weekend.

Temple Square
No trip to Salt Lake City is complete without a long visit to the square that forms the heart of Salt Lake City. You'll find the Family History Library, the Tabernacle, home of the world-famous Mormon Tabernacle Choir, as well as the Temple that gives the square its name. Free tours begin every 5 or 10 minutes at the 100-foot flagpole in the center of this 10-acre block.	   <http://www.delta.com/images/spacer.gif>
