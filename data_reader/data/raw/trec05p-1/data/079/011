Attached is the real audio files from the above CERA conference for your review.  All indications are that government and industry will be working closer with possible real time reporting requirements to manage any impact to the flow of oil in America much like what was setup during world war II.

CERA Chairman Daniel Yergin hosted a presentation by US Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, at which the Secretary spoke on US energy policy and the legislative implications of the war on terrorism.

The importance of energy security strategy has certainly been raised, and Secretary Abraham spoke about actions by both industry and government to adapt to this new environment. He also noted requests from President Bush and Senate Majority Leader Daschle to the US Senate to enact a new US energy strategy. Finally, Secretary Abraham described his agency's efforts to improve communication between government and industry decision makers in this period of bipartisanship and heightened focus on energy security.
