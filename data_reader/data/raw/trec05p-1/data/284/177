Is This an Undiscovered Gem that is Positioned to Go Higher? Review Exactly What
this Company Does. 

Breaking News!!

CDTC Announced That They Have Rebranded As NEX2U
CDTC Inc., the premier provider of multimedia catalogs, revealed its new brand today
as NEX2U(TM) (CDTD). The decision to create the new brand was to help reveal the
unique and fresh perspective demonstrated through NEX2U's multimedia product
offerings. 

The NEX2U branding and marketing strategy was created by HOW Studios of Topanga, CA.
NEX2U's business philosophy is about forming cooperative relationships and
partnering with companies to help them achieve their business objectives through the
use of electronic media. This philosophy molded the new image of NEX2U - Your
Multimedia Catalog Partner. 

Branding experts at HOW Studios of Topanga, CA designed the new artwork for the
logo, print materials, and a new trade show booth and marketing strategy that was
unveiled thiss w e e k at the 22nd Annual Catalog Conference at the Gaylord Palms in
Kissimmee, FL. Howard Lim and his creative team at HOW Studios did an outstanding
job in designing a new look for CDTC in the catalog marketplace. 

NEX2U (CDTD) attended the 22nd Annual Catalog Conference (ACC) at the Gaylord Palms
in Kissimmee, Florida from May 23-25th. The introduction of the NEX2U brand was a
huge success. NEX2U staff gathered leads, performed demos, and established several
business relationships with companies in the U.S. and in Europe who are potential
alliance partners for the future.

The results of several studies performed for the conference concluded the following:
Internet sales remain constant at 7-9% of total sales. When catalog distribution
drops, sales in other distribution channels decrease significantly. The conversion
rate for internet shopping carts is only 21%. The issue isn’t m0re tr@ffic but
rather conversion of the 79% who don’t b u y. The internet is used more for research
than buying. As a result, more businesses are looking at multimedia alternatives. 

Rising postage and paper costs for 2006 are causing large scale catalogers to
rethink their marketing initiatives. Some of the discussion at the conference
surrounded ways to determine how to cut costs by producing smaller catalogs, using
lightweight paper, and many other alternatives. Even smaller companies who are doing
catalogs for the first time are considering multimedia because it can cut production
and shipping costs significantly compared to print. 

NEX2U has a promising outlook in the industry based on market indicators currently
impacting catalogers. NEX2U has positioned itself to develop both B2B and B2C
catalog environments.
