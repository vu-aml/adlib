Latest NFL Player News

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/20/01
With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Alexander
will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during their
charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against the
Chiefs this week.

Tom Brady, QB NE - Uran Man Updated 11/20/01
The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain
the team's No. 2 QB. "I don't see any changes this week," coach Bill
Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe
to your roster as an insurance policy if you can.

Jonathan Quinn, QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this
week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game.

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/20/01
Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice,
says the <i>Seattle Times</i>. He is not expected to return for another two
to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer
for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 11/20/01
Mike Riley told the <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i> there is no QB
controversy involving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. "Doug is going to be
our quarterback," he said. "You can talk about controversy all you want,
but there is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will
start. He will get us the next win the next week." Still, Flutie is not
playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.

Mark Bruener, TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury.
His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is
widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/20/01
Wheatley told the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i> he is no longer being bothered
by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.

Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected
to return to practice early this week.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/20/01
Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky
start in Week 11.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/20/01
The <i>Tennessean</i> says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the
team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect
him to miss any practice time this week. 

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/20/01
Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against
Seattle.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/20/01
Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may
have to start in his place,

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game
against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/20/01
Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve.
Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to
be moved back into the starting lineup. 

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/20/01
Dave Wannstedt told the <i>Miami Herald</i> there is no QB controversy
surrounding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of
hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're
going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 11/20/01
Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently
healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. "We'll get a chance
to evaluate that during the week and see," Shanahan told the <i>Denver
Post</i>. "If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a
situation where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our
team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in." 

Benjamin Gay, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
The <i>Cleveland Plain-Dealer</i> says Butch Davis won't indicate how much
Gay will play in the near future. "We'll try to get him involved in some of
the games," Davis said. "We'll see." 

Kevin Lockett, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to
play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real
value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia.
Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been
feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for the
'Skins. 

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/20/01
Green (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on Wednesday at full
strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the
matchup is favorable. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 11/20/01
Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session
of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered
serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on
Sunday Indianapolis. 

Cecil Martin, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday's game against Dallas.
He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expected to play in this
weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy
player, but he is a key blocker for Duce Staley. 

 Giants, DT NYG - Team Dick Updated 11/20/01
According to the <I>New York Post</I>, cornerback Jason Sehorn's
surgically-repaired right knee began giving him problems again this past
weekend. In fact, the team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either
Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he
continues to play on a bad wheel, you should consider starting any
receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/20/01
The <i>Baltimore Sun</i> says there is no indication that Grbac will be
replaced as the team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough
to start for most Fantasy teams.

Donald Driver, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss
Thursday's game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a
Fantasy player at this point. 

 Ravens, DT BAL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/20/01
Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after
undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of
the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage
than usual. 

 Cowboys, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Linebacker Dexter Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a
sprained knee, will likely get the start on Thursday after being out for
just one game. He'll help keep Denver's running game in check, but don't
expect his presence to give Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/20/01
Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Denver. "I'm not 100
percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job," Smith told the <I>Dallas
Morning Star</I>. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to
Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 11/20/01
Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He
may miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this
weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the
league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11. 

Terry Hardy, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Hardy is expected to return to practice this week after missing three games
due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to play on Sunday
against San Diego. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Harris is out for Thursday's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury.
Harris has been an unreliable Fantasy player and is only worth a roster
spot in deeper leagues. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/20/01
Stewart (ankle) is hopeful that he can play returned to practice and may
start Thursday's game against Green Bay. He will work his ankle extensively
in practice prior to Thursday, and is optimistic that he'll be ready to
play. If Stewart is able to go, he's worth starting in if you need a
running back for Week 11. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 11/20/01
Taylor has been told by a medical specialist that he should not return to
action this weekend against Pittsburgh. In fact, Taylor could be out for an
even longer period of time than what was originally diagnosed. Taylor tore
the groin muscle completely off the bone back in Week Two, which is an
injury that normally takes about three months to heal. "It's going to be
very unfair for anyone to assume he will play any time in the immediate
future," said Taylor's agent, Drew Rosenhaus. "He's just not healthy yet.
He can't run full speed without tremendous pain. The Jaguars have done a
very good job in working him but he's still in pain." Expect Stacey Mack
and Elvis Joseph to continue splitting carries in Taylor's absence. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 11/20/01
Emanuel is out for Thursday's game against Green Bay due to a sprained
ankle. In fact, the injury is so bad that Emanuel may miss the remiander of
the season, but no definitive word on his condition has been made by the
team.

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/20/01
According to published reports, Muhammad's shoulder injury will likely keep
him out of Sunday's game against Atlanta. That could mean big things for
Donald Hayes and Issac Bryd, who'll start against a questionable Falcons
secondary. 

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Luccis Losers Updated 11/20/01
Cleeland (ankle) is doubtful for Sunday's game at New England. He'll likely
be replaced again by Boo Williams, who scored two touchdowns last week
against Indianpolis. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
According to the <I>Dallas Morning News</I>, Carter expects to start on
Dec. 2 against Washington. Carter, who has been out since October with a
hamstring injury, will serve as the No. 3 quarterback on Thursday vs.
Denver. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 11/19/01
Hilliard continues to feel some soreness in his surgically-repaired toe,
and it is causing him to limp around a bit. He is still expected to start
in Monday's game against Minnesota, but playing on the artificial turf
can't be good for his injury. 

Reggie Kelly, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
According to published reports, Kelly (knee/ankle) should be able to return
to action this weekend against Carolina. He won't make much of a Fantasy
impact, however, so don't bother starting him in Week 11. 

Chad Lewis, TE PHI - Blue Balls Updated 11/19/01
Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's 36-3 win over Dallas.
The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Lewis is expected to
start this weekend's game against Washington. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/19/01
McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the
<i>Tennessean</i> says he will probably miss some practice time this week.
He should still be able to play in the team's next game.

 Packers, DT GB - Uran Man Updated 11/19/01
Safety LeRoy Butler suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during
Sunday's game against Atlanta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the
remainder of the season. Chris Akins will likely take over the starting
duties in Butler's absence. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/19/01
McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the
<i>Tennessean</i> says he will probably miss some practice time this week.
He should still be able to play in the team's next game.

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/19/01
Hakim left Sunday's game against New England with an ankle injury. X-rays
were negative, and Hakim is listed as day to day. 

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 11/19/01
Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's
game against Dallas is unclear.

Terance Mathis, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 11/19/01
Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70
yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but
he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Harris suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against
Philadelphia. He did not return to the contest, and is listed as day to
day. 

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/19/01
Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching seven passes
for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the game,
however, and is listed as day to day. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough that he's ready to
return to action. However, the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more
weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. The team wants to evaluate
Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll have any trade value
in the offseason. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/19/01
Jackson told the <i>Cleveland Plain-Dealer</i> it was a coach's decision
not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering from an ankle
injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have been able
to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fantasy value
might drop greatly.

Ryan Leaf, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the <I>Dallas Morning
News</I> is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for
the time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fantasy
Football. 

Kevin Lockett, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib
injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain
at this time. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told
the <I>Washington Post</I> that there's a "definite possibility" he would
be ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham
would start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive
Fantasy option against the Eagles. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/19/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee.
However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when Dallas faces
Denver on Thanksgiving Day. 

Larry Foster, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against
Arizona. He is listed as day to day.

Desmond Howard, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did
not return to the game, and is listed as day to day. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 11/19/01
Emanuel suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is
listed as day to day. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His
status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins.
Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent
Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary
will continue to see some work at his expense.

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/18/01
Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing
defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open
often after starting the year slowly.

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit.
Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better
game this season.

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/18/01
The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23
carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very
thin at RB..

David Sloan, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you
are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks
from Charlie Batch.

Lamont Warren, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64
yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs
and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for
the rest of the year.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 11/18/01
Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for
only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good
Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is
also erratic.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to
get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless
your team is very thin at wideout.

David Terrell, WR CHI - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is
not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 11/18/01
Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his
third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player
you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second-year
receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player.

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards
and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks,
however, which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for
the entire preseason. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 11/18/01
Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. While
he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for
Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable totals.

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 11/18/01
Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98
yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is
becoming somewhat of a gamble. 

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has
not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 11/18/01
Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and
four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the
league and is a must-start every week. 

Jerry Rice, WR OAK - Team Chick Updated 11/18/01
Rice had a huge game on Sunday, catching eight passes for 131 yards and
three touchdowns against San Diego. Rice may not be an every-week starter
in smaller leagues, but he can certainly still put up huge Fantasy numbers
when the matchup is right. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Banks was carted off the field in the second quarter of Sunday's game at
Denver with a concussion. He was replaced by Kent Graham.

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 11/18/01
Favre threw for 262 yards and two TDs against the Falcons, but he was
intercepted three times and lost a fumble. Despite some inconsistent play
in recent weeks, Favre's potential for big games makes him a must-start
every week.

Corey Bradford, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Bradford caught three passes for 117 yards against Atlanta. The Green Bay
wideout is still too inconsistent to be considered a solid Fantasy player.

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Chandler started at Green Bay, and threw for 352 yards, two TDs and two
interceptions. He remains a good Fantasy backup when healthy.

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Christian rushed for 40 yards and caught five passes for 62 yards at Green
Bay. The Falcons are using him more often, and Christian makes a good
backup RB right now.

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/18/01
Grbac threw for 261 yards, two TDs and was intercepted four times by the
Browns. The veteran QB has been a big disappointment this year and should
not start for most Fantasy teams.

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/18/01
Brookins rushed for 89 yards on 21 carries against the Browns. The rookie
is a servicable, yet unspectacular Fantasy player who should give you some
occasional TDs down the stretch. 

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 11/18/01
Couch threw for only 144 yards and was intercepted three times at
Baltimore. The Cleveland QB appears to be a risk even as a Fantasy backup
right now.

Benjamin Gay, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Gay saw his first extensive action of the year, carrying the ball 18 times
for 56 yards and a TD at Baltimore. He displayed good vision and lateral
quickness, and Gay is definitely worth picking up if you need help at RB. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/18/01
Jackson (ankle) did not play at Baltimore. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White
shared carries in his place. 

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 11/18/01
Smith rushed for only 53 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Smith
appears to be mired in mediocrity right now, and he is a risky start unless
you lack depth at RB.

Chris Chambers, WR MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 11/18/01
The rookie wideout caught only two passes for 25 yards against the Jets.
Chambers is still too inconsistent to start for most Fantasy teams.

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/18/01
Moss made his pro debut on Sunday, but did not catch a pass and was stopped
for a six-yard loss on his one carry. The rookie has missed too much time
to make a Fantasy impact this season. 

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Huntley actually had a good outing against San Francisco, posting 94
scrimmage yards and a touchdown. However, he's far too inconsistent to
start on a weekly basis. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/18/01
Weinke started Sunday's game against San Francisco after missing last
week's game due to a shoulder injury. He put up decent numbers, throwing
for 177 yards and two touchdowns in Carolina's 25-22 OT loss. 

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 11/18/01
Chrebet did not catch a pass at Miami. The Jets' wideout is no longer
worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams. 

Garrison Hearst, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Hearst had another strong game, posting 113 scrimmage yards against
Carolina. His comeback from a serious ankle condition is nothing short of
miraculous, and he's actually been a reliable Fantasy player over the last
two weeks. 

Alex Van Pelt, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Van Pelt threw for 316 yards, two TDs and no interceptions against the
Seahawks. He did lose a fumble, but Van Pelt got solid protection for most
of the game and will be a respectable Fantasy backup while he fills in for
the injured Rob Johnson.

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/18/01
Garcia had another huge game, posting 305 yards and three touchdowns
against Carolina. He's been one of the top three Fantasy quarterbacks this
season, and may even be more valuable than Peyton Manning at this point. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
Price caught 10 passes for 138 yards and a TD against Seattle. He has
clearly become Buffalo's best Fantasy player this season.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 11/18/01
Hasselbeck threw for 134 yards, one TD and no interceptions at Buffalo. The
Seattle QB is making less mistakes, yet he doesn't help Fantasy teams much,
either.

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/18/01
Kitna put up 234 yards passing and a touchdown against Tennessee, but two
interceptions made his performance mediocre. He's no better than a reserve
Fantasy player at this point, best used when the matchup is right in a
deeper league. 

Koren Robinson, WR SEA - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Robinson caught two passes for 15 yards at Buffalo, including his first
career TD, a seven-yarder. Robinson is slowly improving, but still does not
produce enough to be a reliable Fantasy player.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 11/18/01
Dillon was held in check by Tennessee, rushing for only 38 yards on Sunday.
However, with all the injured running backs around the league this season,
Dillon is still a must-start on a weekly basis.
