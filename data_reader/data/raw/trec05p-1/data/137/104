I would like to roll them in, however we may not be able to get their information as readily as from the others.

The reason I ask is that Fallon was asking.  We can tell him the cuts roll under us or we can leave Freeman and Hotte to roll their stuff up under Sheriff and Horton.  Your thoughts?

Hotte is doing very minor tweaking for ETS, for EGS they are currently investigating.
Freeman is looking to take down the IT group by another 100, dependant on what happens to Metals and Credit.

What is Hotte doing?  Are they planning any reductions and if so, who, how many, etc?  Also, same questions for EEL and Freeman.
 
Thanks.
