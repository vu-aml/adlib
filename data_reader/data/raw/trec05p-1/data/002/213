Armando executed the wrong price confirms and unfortunately, I did not catch it.  We need to send an amendment to change the price for the August 1- October 31 time frame. I will send a copy of the original that he should have exectued.

Thanks 

Stephanie

You are right.  It was our mistake of executing the wrong  agreement.
 
We will take your 2nd alternative:
 
2. Leave the Inside Ferc. reference for July and change  Aug - Oct. to
enable future hedging opportunities. We would need to create  an
amendment for NGI if you want to go this route.
 
Please make the amendment and sent it to me
Saludos,

I noticed that Mexicana and ENA inadvertantly executed the  confirm that
referenced an "Inside FERC" Socal Border Index. I believe that  we had
revised the paperwork to reflect a "Natural Gas Intelligence"  Socal
Border Price since that is the index used for fianancial settlement  in
the basis markets.  
The Inside FERC index is new (started  in March 2001) and reflects an
index of $4.76 for July whereas NGI  published $4.70. Should you elect to
hedge August, Sept and/or October, we  would need to amend the agreement
to reflect the NGI posting.
Here  are our options:
1. Substitue the first page of the confirm (I would  need to send it back
to you for initials) for July - Oct.
2. Leave the  Inside Ferc. reference for July and change Aug - Oct. to
enable future  hedging opportunities. We would need to create an
amendment for NGI if you  want to go this route.
Please call me to discuss at your earliest  convenience - I will be out
of the office this afternoon but back Monday  morning.
Regards,
Stephanie
