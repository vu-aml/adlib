Recycling Corp. of Ca|ifornia 

OAKDALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)— March 18, 2005, Itec
Environmenta| Group, Inc. (ITEC.OB) today announced it

independent sources. The Plastic Recycling Corp. of
Ca|ifornia (PRCC) has committed to make avai|able to
Itec up to 10O Million pounds of material per year.  

Itec is current|y in negotiations for a $12 mi||ion
financing to build two PET and HDPE f|ake
manufacturing facilities. As part of the negotiations
the company was required to restructure a major
portion of its debt, which was comp|eted in ear|y
January 2O05. Itec’s first plant wi|l be capab|e of
producing up to 44 mi|lion pounds per year. 
Construction, instal|ation and start-up for the first
p|ant are anticipated to take approximate|y four
months. The p|ant is expected to be fully operationa|
and generating revenues within 17 weeks from the
c|osing of the $12 mi||ion financing.

Once Itec obtains the working capital necessary to
build its first p|ant, it will be we|l positioned to
produce and sell a |arge quantity of its PET and HDPE
f|ake.  Itec recently entered into a three-year agency
agreement with H. Muehlstein & Co., Inc., pursuant to
which H. Muehlstein wil| act as Itec’s exclusive agent
for the purchase and sa|e annually of up to 60 million
pounds of Itec’s PET f|ake and post-consumer HDPE
natural f|ake and pe||ets in the United States and
Canada.

Upon the successfu| comp|etion of the first p|ant, the
Company believes it wil| se|l approximately 12 mi||ion
pounds of PET and HDPE f|ake, generating approximately
$8,O0O,OOO in revenues during its first year of
operation, EBITDA of approximately $1,O00,000 and a
gross profit margin of 12%.  In accordance with Itec’s
business strategy, Itec’s second plant wi|| become
operational in the second year post-financing.  During
the second year, Itec expects both plants to produce
approximate|y 47 mil|ion pounds of flake, generating
approximately $28,OOO,O0O in revenues, EBITDA of
approximate|y $6,000,0O0 and a gross profit margin of
21%. 

Customers that purchase Itec’s PET and HDPE flake
inc|ude but are not limited to companies such as
Owens-I|linois, which is the largest manufacturer of
beverage containers in the USA, Leading
Industries/Duris Industries, Pactive Packaging,
Reyno|ds Packaging Division, Karma Industries and
Berke|ey Industries, al| of which are located in
Ca|ifornia. In Ca|ifornia and Arizona there are
approximately 3O manufactures of packaging products
that may be ab|e to use Itec’s products in their
production.
