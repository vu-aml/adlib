Attn:
I am Mr. Eric Persson deputy Managing Director of one of the Prime Bank here in the Netherlands. I was the accounting officer of late Mr. Mario Riminton a national of United State of America who was a contractor here in the Netherlands. On the 21st of  july 2000 my client, his wife and their only son were involved in a car accident along Amstelveen highway in Amsterdam , all occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to his embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives but this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to  contact you to act as the next of kin to Mr Mario Riminton. I have contacted you to assist in transfer of huge Capital of funds($12.500.000) left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the share holders of this bank so that they can share his funds as dividends amongst themselves. The said Bank has issued me a notic!
 e to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next fourteen official working days. Because as at the time of his demise I was his accounting officer ,but have since been promoted to the position of Deputy Managing Director, ever since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 2years now, I seek your consent to present you as the  next of kin to the deceased, so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to you. Therefore, on receipt of your positive response, we shall then discuss the sharing ratio and modalities for transfer. I have all necessary formation and legal documents needed to back you up for claim .... All I require from you is your honest cooperation
to enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. I am waiting to hear from you soon.

Best regards,

Mr. Eric Persson
