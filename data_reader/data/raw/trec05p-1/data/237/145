Good to hear from you, Kim.

            I hope that with your new management team you are able to
survive and grow again with a better foundation.

            I wish you the best.

            Bob

 

Hi Robert,

 

Yes, I am still here!  However, the Research and Development department
is no longer a part of Enron which is why their emails have been
returned to you.  Thank you for your thoughts, I will keep you posted. 

 

Kim.
