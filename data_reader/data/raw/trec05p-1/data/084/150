Danny:

Just wanted give you an update on the status of you becoming a March of Dimes board member. 

Your bio has been passed on to the chair of the nominating committee and the executive director, and they are thrilled to hear about your interest. The nominating process will take place some time between now and the end of the year, and after you have been officially nominated, they will contact us and let us know the next steps.

Missy Stevens from Community Relations is leaving Enron at the end of the month, and Misha Siegel will be taking her position. Misha and I will keep you updated on the status of everything.

Call me with any questions.

Thanks!

Kimberly
