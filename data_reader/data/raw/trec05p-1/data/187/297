hey people

How frighteningly few are the persons whose death would spoil our appetite and make the world seem empty.
I wish it (Christianity) were more productive of good works ... I mean real good works ... not holy-day keeping, sermon-hearing ... or making long prayers, filled with flatteries and compliments despised by wise men, and much less capable of pleasing the Deity.
Defend your limitations and you own them!

Learning is an ornament in prosperity, a refuge in adversity, and a provision in old age.
Do not tell a friend anything you would conceal from an enemy.
Equality consists in the same treatment of similar persons.The search will continue. Not until the empirical resources are exhausted, need we pass on to the dreamy realms of speculation.
Never give in, never, never, never, never, in nothing great or small, large or petty, never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense. Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.
