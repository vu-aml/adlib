* For CNN's extensive coverage of the Simi Valley GOP debate, visit the CNN Political Ticker at cnn.com/ticker.

Though it "had the potential for illumination and clashes, the event was mostly civil, allowed little room for expanded
or thoughtful responses and did little to change the shape of the race." (San Francisco Chronicle)

"Republican operatives agreed that the debate did nothing to shake up the crowded GOP field." (AP)

Rudy Giuliani took the prize for the most references (5) to former President Ronald Reagan.

Total Reagan mentions: 19.

There were just four specific mentions of President George W. Bush by the candidates. (Ticker math)

* Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) said he "got the ball rolling" for Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) "to get a Secret Service detail
after hearing of some 'evidence' -- Durbin declined to specify -- that he said was 'worrisome.'  Several sources said
there was not a single incident or specific threat that triggered the request." (Chicago Sun-Times)

Friends of Obama "say he has resisted the idea of a U.S. Secret Service detail for fear it would limit what has been a
great part of his appeal, namely his ability to make a close connection with voters." (Chicago Tribune)

Thompson apologizes for comment on gay discrimination

LOS ANGELES (CNN) -- Republican presidential candidate Tommy Thompson apologized Friday morning for saying in last
evening's debate that private employers should be allowed to fire gay employees because of their sexual preference.

Thompson was asked by the moderator: "If a private employer finds homosexuality immoral, should he be allowed to fire a
gay worker?"

The former Wisconsin governor answered: "I think that is left up to the individual business. I really sincerely believe
that that is an issue that business people have got to make their own determination as to whether or not they should
be."  The moderator appeared a bit startled: "OK, so the answer is yes?"  Thompson replied, "Yes."

In a telephone interview from O'Hare Airport, Thompson told "American Morning" that he "misinterpreted" the question
and should have asked to have it repeated.

"That's never been my position," Thompson said, said adding that discrimination isn't acceptable.

"NOT READY TO BACK DOWN": House Democratic leaders are indicating they are not ready to back down in their
confrontation with President Bush on Iraq, even as pressure mounts to approve new funding for U.S. troops. House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other party leaders are considering a bill that would fund the war as Bush wants,
but only guarantee the money through July. After that, Congress could block additional money from being sent if the
Iraqi government does not meet certain political and security goals. The proposal, not yet endorsed or briefed to
caucus members, would be a direct challenge to the president, who has demanded Congress fund the war with no strings
attached. This week, Bush vetoed a $124.2 billion bill that would have provided money for operations in Iraq and
Afghanistan while requiring troops to begin coming home by Oct. 1. AP via Yahoo! News: Democrats not backing down on
Iraq Bill http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070504/ap_on_go_co/us_iraq

CLINTON PUSHES EXPIRATION DATE FOR WAR AUTHORIZATION: Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-New York, announced Thursday she is
teaming up with Sen. Robert Byrd, D-West Virginia, to introduce legislation that seeks to de-authorize the Iraq war.
The legislation will propose that the president's Congressional authority for the use of force in Iraq should expire on
October 11, 2007 -- five years to the day after the Senate voted on the authorization. "The American people have called
for change, the facts on the ground demand change, and the Congress has passed legislation that requires change,"
Clinton said on the Senate floor Thursday. "It is time to sunset the authorization for the war in Iraq. If the
president will not bring himself to accept reality, it is time for Congress to bring reality to him." The Ticker:

RICE MEETS SYRIAN FM: Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met on Thursday with her Syrian counterpart in the first
high-level diplomatic contact between Washington and Damascus in more than two years. The 30-minute meeting with
Syria's foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, came in the middle of two days of international talks on Iraq in which the
Bush administration is seeking the help of Iraq's neighbors, and countries around the world, to quell the violence
there and relieve Iraq's enormous debt. To that end, Ms. Rice also tried to speak with her counterpart from Iran, a
country that the United States has no diplomatic relations with and that it has sought to isolate and contain. New York
Times: U.S. and Syria Discuss Iraq in Rare Meeting http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/04/world/middleeast/04diplo.html

EX-DOJ OFFICIAL SPEAKS HIGHLY OF FIRED PROSECUTORS: A former deputy attorney general told the House Judiciary Committee
on Thursday that he regarded most of the fired United States attorneys as highly competent prosecutors who should not
have been dismissed. James B. Comey, who was deputy attorney general from 2003 until August 2005, testified that his
experience with the ousted prosecutors was "very positive," and said he knew of no problems with their performance that
justified their removal. The testimony by Mr. Comey, who was once the United States attorney for the Southern District
of New York, contrasted starkly with assertions of current Justice Department officials who have said the eight
dismissed prosecutors were removed mainly because of failings in their performance. New York Times: Ex-Justice Dept.
Official Defends Ousted U.S. Attorneys http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/04/washington/04attorneys.html

WH ISSUES VETO THREAT FOR HATE CRIMES BILL: After the same-sex marriage fights that roiled the 2004 elections and
knocked gay rights groups on their heels, advocates seemed poised with the Democratic seizure of Congress in November
to enact federal civil rights laws they have sought for nearly two decades. But four hours before House passage
Thursday of a federal hate crimes bill that has languished since 1991, the White House issued a threat to veto the
bill, which would be just the third veto of the Bush presidency. "It makes it apparent to a lot of people," said Rep.
Barney Frank, a gay Massachusetts Democrat, "that as long as you have George Bush as president, nothing that tries to
promote fairness for gay and lesbian people has any chance." Congress also is considering another measure, introduced
in 1994 but never passed, to ban employment discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. San

THE GURUS OF THE YOUTUBE/MYSPACE ERA: Every campaign has someone similar -- young, tech-savvy and committed to the
transforming possibilities of the Internet. For these online political operatives -- or OPOs, as a few have taken to
calling themselves -- the Internet isn't just a tool. It's a strategy, a whole new way of campaigning, a form of
communication, from blogs to MySpace to YouTube, with far more potential than the old media of print and television.
"TV is a passive experience, and the Internet is all about interactivity, all about making a direct connection," said
[Obama OPO Joe] Rospars, waxing expansive in the way all the OPOs tend to do. Washington Post: Meet the OPOs

CAMPAIGNS OFFER MERCHANDISE, INCENTIVES TO LURE DONORS: Clamoring for a John McCain mouse pad? It's yours for $75. For
$20, Dennis Kucinich supporters can nab a ladies' T-shirt, adorned with a red, white and blue peace symbol. Bluegrass
and country music fans can get their fix with a CD for a $50 donation to John Edwards. In their race for campaign cash,
presidential candidates are scrambling to use new and old techniques to sway supporters to give. They range from Mitt
Romney's decision to pay college students a commission for the donations they collect, to meetings with former
president Bill Clinton, arranged by his wife's campaign. USA Today: Merchandise fattens '08 coffers

DEBATE UNLIKELY TO "ALTER THE CONTOURS" OF GOP FIELD: The 10 declared Republican candidates for president introduced
themselves to the nation last night in their first debate of the 2008 campaign season, displaying sharp differences
over social issues, immigration, and the pursuit of Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden as they sought to make a strong
first impression with voters. Former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani struggled to clearly articulate his position on
abortion. Arizona Senator John McCain reiterated his support for staying in Iraq but offered sharp criticism of the
Bush administration's conduct of the war. And Mitt Romney, in his national coming-out party of sorts, delivered a
largely comfortable, confident performance that left his advisers beaming. Boston Globe: Republican candidates show
their differences http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/05/04/republican_candidates_show_their_differences/


GIULIANI OFFERS "SHARP CONTRAST" ON ABORTION: Former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said last night that he would
be "OK" with a Supreme Court repealing Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to
abortion. But Mr. Giuliani said he would approve of the justices upholding the decision -- a sharp contrast with the
nine other candidates on the stage for the first Republican primary debate, who said they would welcome its overturn
and one even saying that would be "the greatest day in the country's history." It was the latest stance for Mr.
Giuliani on an issue that has dogged his campaign as he tries to win the nomination of an avowedly pro-life party whose
social conservative base has such power in the primudles. "It would be OK to repeal. It would be also if a strict
constructionist judge viewed it as precedent," Mr. Giuliani said during the 90-minute debate hosted by the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Library and Museum. "I think the court has to make that decision and then the country can deal with
it." Washington Times: Giuliani wary of repeal of Roe http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20070504-123739-8044r.htm


NO SPECIFIC THREAT, BUT OBAMA GETS SECRET SERVICE DETAIL: Although Sen. Barack Obama has been drawing enormous crowds
and intense attention during his presidential campaign, friends say he has resisted the idea of a U.S. Secret Service
detail for fear it would limit what has been a great part of his appeal, namely his ability to make a close connection
with voters. But those reservations gave way to security concerns on Thursday, when the Secret Service assigned a team
to the Illinois Democrat - the earliest point in a campaign cycle at which the agency has ever taken responsibility for
a candidate not already under its protection as an office holder. Chicago Tribune: Obama gets Secret Service protection

FRED THOMPSON, BLOGGER: Fred Thompson plays a district attorney on TV and, in real life, a commentator on the Internet
— two roles that give him plenty of visibility for a presidential bid. In recent weeks, the former Tennessee senator,
who is considering a run for the Republican nomination, has used conservative Web sites to opine about tax cuts, the
Virginia Tech shootings, even the NFL draft... The actor-politician had experimented with blogging, posting two- and
three-sentence thoughts on the Web site for ABC News Radio, for whom he is a host and commentator. But not until
several weeks ago, after declaring an interest in the presidency, did he start weighing in in earnest. Now his opinion
columns are appearing on RedState.com, the Pajamas Media blog, National Review Online and his own blog, The Fred
Thompson Report. Several other conservative Web sites have picked up the commentaries. AP via Yahoo! News: Thompson and
his ideas are now online http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070504/ap_on_el_pr/fred_thompson_blogs

WOULD WHITE SUPREMACIST TV ROLE BE A LIABILITY? Ronald Reagan became president even though he worked with chimps in B
movies. Arnold Schwarzenegger played a murderous robot, and that didn't keep him from becoming governor. So can "Law &
Order" actor and former Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) become the first presidential candidate with this credit? Thompson
played a white supremacist, spewing anti-Semitic comments and fondling an autographed copy of "Mein Kampf" on a
television drama 19 years ago. His colleagues say that he was just an actor putting everything he had into playing the
role of a charismatic racist, named Knox Pooley, in three episodes of CBS' hit show "Wiseguy" in 1988. "Do you call Tom
Cruise a killer because he played one in a movie?" asked show creator and writer Stephen J. Cannell. But in the age of
YouTube, this performance could raise an intriguing political question: How does a performer eyeing a presidential run
deal with a video history that can be downloaded, taken out of context, chopped into embarrassing pieces and then
distributed endlessly though cyberspace? Some conservative political blogs are already considering the problem. Los
Angeles Times: Will Fred Thompson's racist role have political repercussions?
