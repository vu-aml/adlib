Oh goodness..I wasn't thinking! 

T.K. Lohman indicated that she currently utilizes LIM on her desktop.  Is she a potential resource for you or should we request access for another party within your group?

Julie,

Lorna, Kay and Sean, will not be available as a resource to me starting February 1 because of the Dynegy situation.  Will need our own access.

Please advise.

Thanks, Kim.

Hi Kim:

I will forward your response to Lorna Brennan to ensure that Kay and Sean continue to have access to LIM.

Thank you.

Julie, I currently do not utilize LIM on my desktop, however; in light of the changes with NNG/Dynegy, I believe that someone in my shop should have access to LIM.  We had been currently utilizing Kay Treat and Sean Bolks for LIM information.

Should we coordinate with you?

Please advise.

Kim.

Good Afternoon:

The following information is being compiled per Lorna Brennan:

Please advise me (yes or no) via e-mail if you currently utilize LIM/MIMIC on your desktop.

Thank you for your assistance!
