<2> 	Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Trader:

Markets slumped this week as the anthrax scare widened and
traders took an increasingly gloomy view of the impact of
the September terrorist attacks on global economies.
Copper futures, a leading indicator, sank close to fresh
lows, and Debt futures ended weak.  However, while Stocks
finished the week lower, they managed a Friday rebound, and
the Dollar started to look stronger.  Bottom line though?
Traders are still very nervous.  Crude Oil did a see-saw,
rallying late on production cut hopes after sliding during
the week, while Natural Gas advanced on the basis of a
forecast that the coming winter would be cooler than the
warm winters of the late 90's.  Huge supplies and great
weather continued to depress Corn and Soybeans, while Wheat
rebounded on firm cash and export hopes.  Sugar had a late
surge, but Cocoa sold off ahead of new-crop shipments,
Coffee fell back after a failed rally, and Cotton sank on
ideal harvest conditions.  Hogs and Bellies closed on the
weak side, Cattle mixed.
