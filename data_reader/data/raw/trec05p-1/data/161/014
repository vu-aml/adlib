Subject: GISB EC Consideration of the Base Contract


Dear EC Members, Alternates, Contracts Subcommittee Members and EC Meeting
Participants,

We have received several requests to extend the comment period for the
consideration of the base contract due to unexpected work load.  After
speaking to the chair of the Contracts Subcommittee and the officers of the
EC, the comment period is extended to January 15 and while it will be
discussed at the EC meeting in December, it will not be voted on for
adoption
until the February EC meeting.  We hope that this change does not
inconvenience you.

Best Regards, GISB Office
