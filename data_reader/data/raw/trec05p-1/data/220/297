If you have not already taken your drug test , please do so by Tuesday, 5th February.   This process needs to be completed and results fed back to UBS prior to your start date.   You cannot commence employment with UBS until they have this data which takes approximately 5 days from date of test.

If for any reason you cannot take this test by tomorrow, please advise.    Also, if you have completed your test please let me know so I can update the UBS records.


Regards,

Karen.
