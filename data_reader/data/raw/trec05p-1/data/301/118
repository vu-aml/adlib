"Society has long been hostile to intellectuals, suspecting them of everything from moral weakness and dangerous scepticism to communist conspiracy and venereal disease, but never has it been quite so explicit in pursuing the opposite prejudice, the moral elevation of simple-mindedness.  We North Americans find ourselves, on the brink of the third millenium, living in a high-tech society in which, paradoxically, stupidity is our brightest badge of goodness.  -- Mark Kingwell, Dreams of Millennium",
