FROM: BALOY SITHOLE. 
TELL: 27-735-660-276 

ATTN:PRESIDENT/CEO 

  I know you will be surprised to read from me, but please
consider this as a request from a family i dire need of
assistance.First, I must introduc myself. I a MR. BALOY
SITHOLE. from Angola. I am the first and only son of
BRIGADIER SITHOLE JONES. I am presently resident in South
Africa. 

I got your contact address from a business directory in
Johannesburg Chamber of commerce and Industry. On behalf of
my widowed mother MRS. ELIZABETH SITHOLE, I desided to
solicit for your assistance to transfer the sum of US$21.5
MILLION( TWENTY ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED
STATES DOLLARS)inherited from my late father, into your
personal/ company's account. 
Before my fathers' death, he was a Brigadier in charge of
Arms and Ammunation procurement for the Angola Army. In his
WILL, he specifically drew my attention 
to the said sum of money which he deposited in a safe box
of a private Security Company in Johannesburg- South Africa
in a treasure box, fully documented in my 
name. 

IN FACT MY FATHER SAID AND I QUOTE 

'MY BELOVED SON, I WISH TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO US$21.5
MILLION . I DEPOSITED THE BOX CONTAINING THIS MONEY IN A
SECURITY COMPANY IN JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA. DURING THE
WAR, I WAS VERY DEDICATED AND OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT
FUNCTIONARIES WERE BUSSY HELPING THEMSELVES WITH GOVERNMENT
FUNDS AND PROPERTIES AND SENDING THEM TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES.
DUE TO THIS, WHEN I AND MY FORMER SPECIAL ADVISOR TO THE
PRESIDENT WERE ASSIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT (EDUARDO SANTOS)
TO PURCHASE ARMS IN SOUTH AFRICA, WE SAW THIS AS A GOLDEN
OPPORTUNITY AND DIVERTED THE MONEY AND DIVIDED IT. i GOT A
TOTAL SUM OF US$21.5 MILLION. IN 
CASE OF MY ABSENCE ON EARTH, AS A RESULT OF DEATH ONLY, YOU
SHOULD SOLICIT FOR THE FUND FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES.' 

From the above, you will understand that the lives and
future of my family depens on this money, as such I will be
grateful if you can assist us. We are now living in South
Africa as political Asylum seekers and financial laws and
regulation of the Republic of South Africa do not permit us
financial rights to such huge sum of money. In view of
this, I cannot invest this fund in South africa, hence i am
prepared to offer you 20% of the total fund, while 10% will
be set aside for local and international expenses and 70%
will be for my family and me. 

Finally, modalities on howthe transfer will be bone will be
conveyed to you once we have established trust and
confidence between ourselves. Please treat this matter as
very urgent. 


Best regards, 

BALOY SITHOLE.
