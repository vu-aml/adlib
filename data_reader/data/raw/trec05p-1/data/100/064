Healthcare Outlook: Biotechnology  Pharmaceuticals:
development, delivery and distribution

Tremendous competition exists to find the new technology
that will identify new drug targets. Bioinformatics
companies that can bring precision to the R&D process,
but yet, may never be profitable. An expensive and
pitfall ridden drug approval  process.  A complex
business landscape created by the mergers of giant,
multinational pharmaceutical companies and upstart
biotech ventures. In the span of one day Healthcare
Outlook will address these issues and look at the
business plans of 50 private companies that promise
to innovate an industry. Industry executives, leading
academics and venture capitalists will meet to lend
perspective and point out opportunities along the
complicated life cycle of developing a drug.

* Optical Processor Firm Chorum Lands $54.7M Round Four
By Giselle Greenwood <mailto:greenwood@venturewire.com>	top   mail <http://venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=NIQLONQMII> 	
RICHARDSON, TEXAS -- Chorum Technologies, a provider of all-optical processors and subsystems for optical networks, said it raised $54.7 million in its fourth round of funding.

Other investors included new investor Wheatley Partners, and previous investors Star Ventures, Austin Ventures, Rho Management Trust, Crown Advisors International, Azure Capital Partners, Sycamore Ventures, Bowman Capital Management, and J. & W.

* Encorp Closes $38.1 Million Series D, Names New CEO
By Michelle Tsai <mailto:tsai@venturewire.com>	top   mail <http://venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=QLPMJQPMII> 	
WINDSOR, COLO. -- Encorp, a provider of products and services for the power-technology sector, has closed $38.1 million in Series D financing and appointed Dennis Orwig as chief executive officer. 

New investor Ballentine Capital Partners led the round, which also included other new investors, Perseus and Wexford Management. All existing investors -- Arete's Utech Climate Challenge Fund, Craig Drill Capital, Enron North America, Enstar Management, and Micro-Generation Technology Fund -- reinvested. Banc of America Securities served as placement agent for the deal.

Encorp had expected to raise $20 million for the round when it began fund-raising last fall, said Mr. Orwig, adding that the company's valuation is significantly up from the last round. Prior to this round, the company had raised $4.5 million. 

Prior to Encorp, Mr. Orwig served as CEO and president of Catalytica Energy Systems, a manufacturer of pollution-prevention equipment. He replaces founder and former CEO and president, Jeff Whitham, who retains his chairman position on the board. The president position remains open.

Steve Ballentine of Ballentine Capital Partners joins the board, as does Mr. Orwig. Seven directors comprise the board, which is full.

New funds will be used for product and service development and commercialization. The company employs 115 and does not expect significant staff growth in the next year. Encorp, which opened six new sales offices this year, doesn't plan any additional new offices. 

The company will break even within the next five years, said Mr. Orwig, who added that the company will be investing heavily in product development in the next 15 months. Encorp expects to generate $10 million to $12 million in revenues this year.

* Napster Cuts 15% of Staff, Prepares for New Service
By Lizbeth Scordo <mailto:scordo@technologicp.com>	top   mail <http://venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=NIIHKIQMII> 	
REDWOOD CITY, CALIF. -- Napster, the embattled online song-swapping service, has cut 16 employees, approximately 15% of its staff, in an effort to strengthen resources in other areas as it prepares for the launch of its new membership-based service, the company said in a written statement. 

A Napster spokesperson said the layoffs mainly focused on customer service, business development departments, and administration areas. The company's staff now totals 88.

Last month Napster said it reached a preliminary agreement with American songwriters and music publishers to settle their class-action lawsuit, under which Napster agreed to pay damages of $26 million to music creators and copyright owners for unauthorized uses of music, and will also pay an advance of $10 million against future licensing royalties. The company has also settled lawsuits brought by musicians Metallica and Dr. Dre. 

Napster, which once let users download and trade songs for free, is planning to launch a fee-based membership service, though the target date has not been disclosed. 

The company is backed by Hummer Winblad, the University of California at Los Angeles, and individuals. Last year Napster also received a $60-million loan from Bertelsmann that may convert to equity.

* Bigstep Lays Off A Third of Staff
By Michelle Tsai <mailto:tsai@venturewire.com>	top   mail <http://venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=IJMKMNPMII> 	
SAN FRANCISCO -- Bigstep, which provides small businesses with electronic business services, has laid off 25 employees, according to CEO Lucy Reid.

Since last December, the company's staff size has shrunk from 150 employees to 50. This round of layoffs eliminated positions in engineering, content, marketing, and administration, including two vice presidents. The layoffs came after Bigstep attracted fewer customers as it became a fee-based service this summer and also from the completion of Bigstep's product development, said Ms. Reid. 

The company, which has raised $72 million in venture capital, closed $6.5 million in Series E funding in September from InterWest Partners, Mayfield, Partech International, Staenberg Venture Partners, U.S. Venture Partners, VeriSign, The Washington Post, and Worldview Technology Partners. 

Ms. Reid said the layoffs were not related to the funding and that the company still expects to break even in the third quarter of 2002.

By Jeffrey Sanders <mailto:sanders@venturewire.com>	top   mail <http://venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=MJHKLOQMII> 	
OTTAWA -- Tropic Networks, which develops optical packet networking systems, released 35 people, or 19% of its total staff in an across-the-board cost-cutting move, according to a company spokesperson.

The layoffs occurred in both of Tropic's offices, in Ottawa and Andover, Mass., with the most cuts in the Ottawa office. The company, which now employs 150, did not make any changes to its executive management team, the spokesperson said. All employees received severance packages.

In early September, Tropic Networks secured a $10 million loan from GATX/MM Venture Finance Partnership, Silicon Valley Bank, and Transamerica Commercial Finance. The money was to be used for purchasing equipment for product trials and testing.

The company reduced its headcount in order to preserve its cash until 2003, the spokesperson said, adding that it is still on target to release its first product in 2002. 

Tropic Networks has raised $80 million to date and is also backed by Altamira Management, Anschutz Investment Co., Celtic House, Crescendo Ventures, Enron Broadband Services, Goldman Sachs Group, Kodiak Venture Partners, the Ontario Teachers Pension, and Raza Foundries.

* RadioWave.com in Talks to be Acquired, May Lay Off 25
By Giselle Greenwood <mailto:greenwood@venturewire.com>	top   mail <http://venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=IPNQPOPMII> 	
CHICAGO -- RadioWave.com, which provides a Web-based, interactive audio player, has warned 25 of its 28 employees of possible layoffs with severance in two weeks.

CEO Bill Pearson said the company is in a "pretty vulnerable state," and is talking to several companies about the possibility of being acquired. Although the company has not shut down, if no one acquires the company, it will no longer be in business, Mr. Pearson said, adding that he expects a decision to be made in two weeks. 

"It is a possibility that we will remain intact," Mr. Pearson said. "However, we're anticipating the worst."

Mr. Pearson attributed the slumping ad market to the company's demise, leading to the decision to increase its fees to make up for revenue loss. Previously, the company did not rely on its fees as a source of revenue, but with ad revenue flagging, Mr. Pearson said a fee increase is necessary.

If the company is acquired, Mr. Pearson said it will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of a larger company.

RadioWave.com has raised $22 million from FBR Technology Venture Partners, Intel Capital, Motorola, Susquehanna Radio, and Warburg, Pincus Equity Partners.

* FreeRein Lays Off Most of Staff, Looks for Buyers and Funds
By Michelle Tsai <mailto:tsai@venturewire.com>	top   mail <http://venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=MJHJNHQMII> 	
BELLEVUE, WASH. -- FreeRein, a developer of platforms that provide enterprise applications and services, has laid off all but six of its 31 remaining employees, according to CEO Bruce Gilpin.

The company laid off five employees in September, but needed to make additional cuts to conserve cash, Mr. Gilpin said. Of the firm's executive staff, Mr. Gilpin, the chief financial officer, the chief scientist, and the vice president of product strategy remain.

FreeRein continues to operate and to fund-raise for $10 million in Series B financing, though it has also begun to look for a buyer. Existing investors ComVentures and Technology Partners will contribute to the round if FreeRein can secure a new lead investor, said Mr. Gilpin. He added that given the current fund-raising environment, an acquisition is more likely. FreeRein expects to find a buyer in the wireless enterprise or carrier sectors.

Without additional capital, the company can operate through the end of the year, since 90% of its former staff worked on technology development. The company expects to generate $500,000 in revenues this year.

FreeRein has raised $15 million in venture capital from ComVentures and Technology Partners. In March, FreeRein acquired Clarios, which creates wireless platforms for messaging, in a stock swap.
