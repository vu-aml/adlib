CAN YOU BELIEVE? FLY TO EUROPE FROM $178 RT + YOU COULD RECEIVE A FREE USA TICKET WHEN YOU RETURN--WOW! 

This is one unbelievable offer. Fly to Europe from $178 roundtrip, now through March 20, 2002, and you could earn double airmiles. This is one heck of a double whammy. On many routes to Europe, you will earn enough airmiles for a free domestic U.S. or Canada roundtrip ticket. What's also great is that you could earn an off-peak ticket for as little as 20,000 airmiles and an all year ticket for just 25,000 airmiles. For 30,000 airmiles, you could fly to the Caribbean or Mexico. For example, Los Angeles, San Diego or San Francisco or Rome, Munich or Frankfurt is only $328 roundtrip and you will earn over 27,000 airmiles. If you're short on miles, you can purchase up to 5,000 additional miles for three cents a mile. In this case, you would only have to purchase 3,000 more miles for $90 to fly to the Caribbean. From Dallas to Amsterdam, you can earn 20,000 airmiles or enough miles for a free off-peak domestic ticket. This promotion is valid from over 55 U.S. cities to Manchester, London, Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris, Madrid, Rome, Frankfurt or Munich. Check out our qualifying cities at <http://mercury.xxi.com/travel/desks/story.asp?id=48119>. Remember, all travel for this unbelievable offer must be completed by March 20, 2002, no exceptions.
