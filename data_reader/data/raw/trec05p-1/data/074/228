Gerald and Judy,

Shawyne Smith has made the following deals with Unimark LLC   pooled and committed wells ( 1063501, 1033968, and 1063576 ) which include pricing language with 5 separate tiers for maximum volumes of 4275/d.
How should we confirm these deals?  We have language to confirm 2 pricing tiers.  

Judy how should we proceed to confirm these deals?  Should we start this trend of multiple pricing tiers for such small volumes?

Please let me know how we should proceed.
