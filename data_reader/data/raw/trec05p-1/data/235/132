Currently the Northend temperatures show to drop from mid 30's Saturday to 19 degrees Sunday and 10 degrees for system weighted temperature for Monday and start back up into the high 20's and low 30's by Friday of next week. With these kind of temperatures and Redfield withdrawals falling off it is going to starting requiring more flow coming up from the south.I would recommend that we hold off and see what the end of next week looks like.

Randy, the time table you have for this outage  is 02/26 to 02/28 to replace a section of the exhaust header. If we have cold temps the first part of the week, can this outage be pushed back a few days?
