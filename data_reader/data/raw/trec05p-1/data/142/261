TITLE VII PUNITIVE DAMAGES NOT DEPENDENT ON COMPENSATORY
DAMAGES

Punitive damages may be awarded in cases under Title VII of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act regardless of whether a judge or
jury awarded any compensatory damages, the Second Circuit
rules, addressing an issue of first impression
("Cush-Crawford v. Adchem Corp., "2d Cir., No. 00-7617,
11/16/01). The appeals court affirms a jury verdict of
$100,000 in punitive damages but no other damages for Tonia
Cush-Crawford in her Title VII sexual harassment suit
against Adchem Corp. The statute allows a maximum of
$100,000 in total damages for companies of Adchem's size.

The statutory caps "strongly undermine the concerns that
underlie the reluctance to award punitive damages without
proof of actual harm," Judge Leval writes. Citing the
different purposes underlying the award of compensatory
damages and punitive damages, Leval also says it would be
improper for an employer who acted with malice or reckless
indifference to the employee's rights to escape the award of
punitive damages just because the employee was fortunate
enough to avoid suffering actual harm . . . . Page AA-1,

JUDGE REJECTS CHALLENGE TO FORD'S POLICIES FOR EXTENDING
FMLA LEAVE

Ford Motor Co.'s requirement that absent workers notify the
employer of the need to extend an approved medical leave
within five days of the expiration of the leave does not
violate the Family and Medical Leave Act, the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Michigan rules ("Alexander
v. Ford Motor Co.,  "E.D. Mich.,  No. 01-70051,  11/5/01 ).

 A group of Ford employees sued challenging the company's
"five-day quit" procedures, as applied to those employees
seeking to extend an approved FMLA leave. Department of
Labor regulations interpreting the FMLA require the employer
to give employees two days to notify it of the need for an
extended leave, so Ford's more generous policy does not
violate the act, Judge Edmunds finds, granting Ford summary
judgment on the claim. . . . Page A-7

FEDERAL EMPLOYEES CAN BRING RETALIATION SUITS UNDER ADEA

Federal employees may bring retaliation claims against their
agencies under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the
District of Columbia Circuit rules ("Forman v. Small, "D.C.
Cir., No. 00-5256, 11/16/01). Although the ADEA provision
waiving sovereign immunity for federal employee suits does
not specifically mention retaliation claims, the language
requiring that federal agency personnel decisions "shall be
made free from any discrimination based on age" is broad
enough to do so, the court explains in a retaliation suit
brought by a curator for the Smithsonian Institution.

Unlike the express prohibitions applicable to private,
state, and local employers in ADEA Section 623(d), the
provision governing federal agencies, 29 U.S.C. Section
633a(a), does not by its terms prohibit retaliation.
"Congress's failure to mention 'retaliation' explicitly does
not undermine its intended breadth of the provision," the
court says. It is difficult to imagine, it adds, how a
workplace could be "free from any discrimination based on
age" if a federal agency could fire or take other action
adverse to an employee for complaining about age
discrimination. . . . Page A-1

WORKER'S CLAIM ADVANCES BASED ON REQUIRED REPORT TO
HARASSING BOSS

A machine shop worker at a Pennsylvania factory can proceed
with her sexual harassment claim against her former employer
because the company's internal policy required her to report
the actions to her supervisor--who was one of the alleged
harassers, a federal judge in Philadelphia rules ("Hare v.
H&R Industries Inc., "E.D.Pa., No. 00-CV-4533, 11/7/01).

Rejecting H&R Industries' motion for summary judgment, Judge
James McGirr Kelly of the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania holds that former employee
Priscilla Hare presented enough evidence for her claims
under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the
Pennsylvania Human Relations Act to go to trial.

Hare's evidence showed that the company's policy was
ineffective and that her failure to pursue it was
reasonable, the court holds, and she also presented evidence
that her subsequent termination resulted from harassment. .

NO DENIAL OF BENEFITS TO DEPRESSED HARASSER, DIVIDED COURT
DECIDES

A Michigan probation officer allegedly unable to continue
working because of depression arising from his suspension
for sexually harassing female public defenders, may not be
denied workers' compensation based on his status as a sex
harasser, a divided Michigan Court of Appeals rules ("Daniel
v. Corrections Dep't, "Mich. Ct. App., No. 224423, 11/2/01).

Tony Daniel's conduct was not willful and intentional and
the depression he faced is too attenuated to find that it
occurred by reason of his acts, Judge Danhof holds in
reversing the judgment of the workers' compensation board
and trial court. Calling Daniel an "unsympathetic" and
"difficult" employee is not enough to disqualify him from
receiving benefits, the appeals court says. The state
workers' compensation law was designed to remove the focus
on the consideration of the fault of the claimant, the court
says.

In dissent, Judge O'Connell says that allowing a serial
sexual harasser to profit from his misconduct was
"untenable" and a result never contemplated under the state
workers' compensation law.  . . . Page A-5
