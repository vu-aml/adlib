Sally has a Dr.'s Appt. on Monday, Feb. 4, therefore she has asked that I move the meeting time (Mon. Feb. 4 only) to review the task list from 9:00am to "11:00 am CST".  For those of you outside the office, please let me know if you would like for me to conference you in by phone.

Unless you are scheduled to be on vacation, please make every effort to attend these meetings daily so we can assure all tasks are updated.


Thank you,
