Dear Colleague:

Eric W Cope has submitted an application to AT&T Labs,
with a request that we seek a reference letter from you in support of this application.
We thank you in advance for providing this letter.  The reference letters are
a very important part of our evaluation process, but we also recognize that
they call for a significant measure of time and attention on your part.
In this message, we first describe below the three options for submittal
of the letter, and then, in the final paragraphs, you will find some
comments about the nature of the job applied for.

We know your time is precious, so we have tried to make the
process as efficient as possible.  If you have access to a browser
from your mailer, then the easiest thing is to use the URL given below:

  http://www.research.att.com/~kbl/cgi-bin/resumedocs/S05371/R966

Via this web page, you can submit text, html, postscript, or pdf files.
Please note that this URL should be used ONLY by you, and ONLY for
this particular student.  It is linked directly to the student's resume,
and the processing occurs automatically and immediately.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
If it is inconvenient to use the URL, you may email your letter by replying
to this email, but please help us out, if you use this option, by sending
the letter as plain text only, not as a word processor file, without indent, and
not as an attachment.  Also please make sure that your mailer includes
the entire subject line in your reply message.
If you use this option, please note that the processing of your letter
will occur manually, and therefore may entail a considerable delay.

Our system will format the emailed text appropriately for display, unless
you ask that it be treated as fixed-format.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
As a third option, if you prefer you may submit your letter as hard copy.  Please
note that we discourage this approach, since electronic letters can be
distributed far more effectively to the hiring managers.  However, if you
wish, please see http://www.research.att.com/academic/Addresses.html
for information on the proper address to use for various purposes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, a word about the position for which the student has applied:

This student has applied for a summer internship.
We hire summer interns roughly from the third year of undergraduate
work through graduate school.  The summer projects vary in level,
depending on the student involved.  The students normally work in
a one-on-one fashion with a member of staff on some facet of the
ongoing research work in the lab, but they are expected to function
somewhat independently after an initial period of familiarization
with the work.  Accordingly, we are interested in information you
may have as to the student's adaptability, ability to learn new
material, and to work effectively with minimal supervision.


Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Ken Lyons,
AT&T Labs Web Resume Database
