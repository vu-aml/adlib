Louise,

Attached is a new table derived from the list we reviewed on Thursday.

This table, combined with the BoD approved Transaction Approval Process (TAP) on the RAC Website (rac.corp.enron.com), should provide originators in the Americas with a roadmap for seeking spending approval and indicate where authority and responsibility lies for such approval.  (FYI, the TAP is likely to change at the next board meeting--I'll send you a revised version next week.)

The next step is an initiative to improve spending controls by linking DASH approved levels to the Accounting and Treasury systems.  Rick Carson will be heading up this project and coordinating with Accounting and Treasury for support.

Please distribute this as you see fit within your team.  Let me know if any changes are required.

 
Regards,
