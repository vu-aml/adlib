      RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD} =20
  {ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS) =20
  ********************************************

Hello Dear,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 126,000.000.00 USD) One hundred and =
Twenty six million United States Dollars) from a Bank in Africa,  You c=
an serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me=
 till the end for this important business trusting in you and believing=
  in God that you will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Mr.John Neff, the Auditor General of a bank in Africa, during the =
course of our auditing I discovered a floating fund in an account opene=
d in the bank in 1995 and since  1998 nobody has operated on this accou=
nt again, after going through some old files in the records I discovere=
d that the owner of the account died without a [heir] hence the money i=
s floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be for=
feited for nothing. the owner of this account is Mr. Frankline Sullivan=
, a foreigner, and a sailor, and he died, since 1998. and no other pers=
on knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has=
 no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that Fr=
ankline Sullivan until his death
was the manager Sulliv Coy.(pty). SA. =20

We will start the  first transfer with Twenty six million [$26,000.000]=
 upon successful transaction without any disappoint from your side, we =
shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest amount to your ac=
count.

The amount involved is (USD 126M) One hundred and Twenty Six million Un=
ited States Dollars, only I want to first transfer $26,000.000 [Twenty =
Six million United States Dollar from this money into a safe foreigners=
 account abroad before the rest, but I don't know any foreigner, I am o=
nly contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approve=
d to a local person here, without valid international foreign passport,=
 but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid international pas=
sport or drivers license and foreign a/c because the money is in us dol=
lars and the former owner of the a/c Mr. Frankline Sullivan is a foreig=
ner too, [and the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us together I got yo=
ur contact address from my secretary who operates computer, I am reveal=
ing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in =
this business, So please reply urgently so that I will inform you the n=
ext step to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and fax num=
ber including the full details of the account to be used for the deposi=
t.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a bindin=
g agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to=
 any account of your choice where the fund will be safe. Before we fly =
to your country for withdrawal, sharing and investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine. because the manag=
ement is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct=
 information of this account, which I will give to you, upon your posit=
ive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet=
 up with instruction of a key bank official who is deeply involved with=
 me in this business.

I need your strong assurance that you will never, never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank official we can transfer=
 this money to any foreigner's reliable account which you can provide w=
ith assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arriv=
al in your country for sharing. The bank official will destroy all docu=
ments of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace=
 to any place and to build confidence you can come immediately to discu=
ss with me face to face after which I will make this remittance in your=
 presence and three of us willfly to your country at least two days ahe=
ad of the money going into the account.

hat you are ready to act and receive this fund in your account. I will =
use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward =
transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from =
 the relevant ministries and foreign exchange departments.

amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for exp=FFenses both parti=
es might have incurred during the process of transferring.You should tr=
