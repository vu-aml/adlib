[0]Roland Piquepaille writes "Quantum computing is usually associated
with extremely low temperatures. Physicists at Harvard University have
shown that [1]diamonds can be used to create stable quantum computing
building blocks at room temperature. A nitrogen vacancy in diamond could
lead to quantum registers able to store or retrieve data. '"The problem
is, what makes single nuclear spin so stable - its weak interaction with
its surroundings - also prevents us from directly manipulating it," Lukin
says. "How do you control something that can't interact with anything?"
You do it gingerly and indirectly, the Harvard physicists report in
Science. They found that nuclear spins associated with single atoms of
carbon-13 - which make up some 1.1 percent of natural diamond - can be
manipulated via a nearby single electron whose own spin can be controlled
with optical and microwave radiation.'"

unchiujar writes "The New York Times reports that the full genome of
James D. Watson, one of the discoverers of the structure of DNA in 1953,
has been deciphered, marking what some scientists believe is the gateway
to an impending [0]era of personalized genomic medicine. A copy of his
genome, recorded on a pair of DVDs, was presented to Dr. Watson on
Thursday in a ceremony in Houston by Richard Gibbs, director of the Human
Genome Sequencing Center at the Baylor College of Medicine, and by
Jonathan Rothberg, founder of the company 454 Life Sciences. 'The first
two genome sequences belonging to individuals are now being made
available to researchers within a few days of each other. One is Dr.
Watson's and the other belongs to J. Craig Venter, who as president of
the Celera Corporation started a human genome project in competition with
the government. Dr. Venter left Celera after producing only a draft
version of a genome, his own, in 2001, which the company did no further
work on. He has now brought his genome to completion at his own institute
in Rockville, Md., and deposited it last week in GenBank, a public DNA
database, he said.'"

Stony Stevenson writes "A team of US researchers is using the
super-adhesive properties of nanoglue to [0]create a super-sticky
web-shooting device much like the comic-book hero Spiderman's. The
nanoglue is also being trialed in the production of computer chip
circuitry and is expected to miniaturize the process, meaning faster and
more powerful chips. From the article: '"If we can find a way to create
threads and/or intertwined bundles using the molecules in a scalable
fashion, while retaining the adhesive properties, then creating
web-shooters similar to Spiderman's is a real possibility," Ramanath
said. "There are ways in which molecular threads/bundles can be created
in large quantities. The challenge will be, however, to simultaneously
engineer adhesion on certain surfaces (and not others, since we want the
suit only to form on the desired surface) and also with each other during
the thread formation."'"

An anonymous reader writes "The Harvard Law Review, a journal for legal
scholarship, recently published a short piece on [0]the privacy
implications of online photo-tagging (pdf). The anonymously penned piece
dourly concludes that 'privacy law, in its current form, is of no help to
those unwillingly tagged.' Focusing on the privacy threat from newly
emergent automatic facial recognition search engines', like [1]Polar Rose
but not Flickr or Facebook, the article states that 'for several reasons,
existing privacy law is simply ill-suited for this new invasion.' The
article suggests that Congress create a photo-tagging opt-out system,
similar to what they did with telemarketing calls and the Do-Not-Call
Registry." How would you enforce such a registry, though?

the Phenom FX, X4 and X2. If you're unfamiliar with Phenom, the
processors will be based on AMD's K10 architecture. They've been tight
lipped about specifics, but we know that it will feature a faster on-die
memory controller, support 64-bit and 128-bit SSE operations, and they'll
be outfitted with 2MB of on-chip L2 cache (512KB dedicated per core) in
addition to 2MB of shared L3 cache. This week, instead of revealing some
more of the juicy details regarding those enhancements, AMD just sent
over [1]a tasty photo of a Phenom die. At least it's something."

[0]mrbluze writes "It appears that more and more of the data collection
sanctioned by the US government is [1]passed through the hands of private
enterprise, Salon reports. 'Because of the cloak of secrecy thrown over
the intelligence budgets, there is no way for the American public, or
even much of Congress, to know how those contractors are getting the
money, what they are doing with it, or how effectively they are using it.
The explosion in outsourcing has taken place against a backdrop of
intelligence failures for which the Bush administration has been hammered
by critics, from Saddam Hussein's fictional weapons of mass destruction
to abusive interrogations that have involved employees of private
contractors operating in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.
Aftergood and other experts also warn that the lack of transparency
creates conditions ripe for corruption.'"

technology that uses the magnetic quantum properties of the spin of
electrons, or plasmonics, another one which 'involves the transfer of
light electromagnetic energy into a tiny volume, thus creating intense
electric fields.' Now, researchers at the University of Alberta (U of A)
have merged these two nascent research fields to create [1]a new
nanotechnology field called spinplasmonics. According to the researchers,
this new technology, which was already used to control the quantum state
of an electron's spin to switch a beam of terahertz light, could one day
be the basis for 'computers with extraordinary capacities.'"

wants Taking Liberties to shake the British public out of their apathy
over what he sees as the dangerous erosion of traditional rights and
freedoms. 'This film uses shock tactics. We needed to be unashamedly
populist... Once you give up traditional liberties such as free speech
and the right to protest you are not going to easily get them back,' says
