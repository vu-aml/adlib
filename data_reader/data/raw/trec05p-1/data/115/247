Guys,
Here is the draft of some of the ways of looking at the EGM businesses.  This is the starting template and it will become a living document that can be attached with your cash flow sheets and 2002 earnings summaries.  I would like your written comments and other views on these sheets/topics.  

Obviously this is very confidential.

Thanks,
M
