Rod - The furniture that David is interesting in purchasing was acquired by Enron International a couple of years ago.  So... It's now your asset.  We have made him a fair offer.  You would get the cash proceeds.  Do you want our office to negotiate or is it a take it or leave it deal.  This is very good quality stuff but way off standard from what we expect to use in future.  Also... we think we'll have plenty of executive furniture to keep in stock for future use, i.e. these pieces can be considered surplus.  Your thoughts - Bill

Bill, do you want to discuss this?  The items you guys want to keep or you think I'm being unreasonable on, tell me and we'll exclude those and focus on the others.  We probably need to decide this week as I am moving next week and need to tell my new landlord what to remove from my new space, which comes furnished. Thanks, David

David - 
Bill Donovan has been made aware of this pricing structure for your furniture. The pricing offered you represents 
the discounting structure available to executives leaving Enron for furniture purchases.  Feel free
to contact Mr. Donovan to discuss this matter further.  As we discussed, I believe your offer of $300
is fair for your desk chairs.

Do you want to forward this message trail to him, or should I , or what is the next step? Also, I think we'd find that in the present market, fair market value for used office furniture would be below or far below what I proposed.

David -
I would need to look at your chair.  The prices quoted are based on fair market value and depreciation factors.
Additional discounting will need to be addressed with Bill Donovan who is the president of EPSC.

Bill, I have proposed below pricing for the furniture that  I would be more comfortable with, given it will be separated from the Enron built in decor and dimensions it was designed to integrate with. This particularly affects the desk, which is very nice but drawerless and designed to work together with the wall unit that sits behind it. The "credenza w/tamboor" is built in to the wall to fit the specific dimensions of that space and probably should be kept in the office. Also, I noticed that my desk chair was not on the list, perhaps because it is older. I would propose $300.
