Kevin,

How are you doing? Hope things are going well for you.
As for myself, I might have to go back home to
Indonesia in a short time. I have not decided the time
yet, but I'll let you know what is the definite time.

I was wondering if you might have time for a lunch
next week. Let me know if you are available. Thanks.


David Junus
