The code only seems to have 'nick', which is set to the name you enterwhen you first switch on a new OLPC. Is your position that there shouldbe separate attributes, 'nick' which you can change, and 'name' whichyou can't? Is there any design in which this is documented? In theabsence of any particular reference, I'd been assuming the codeimplements the design.

So something like, the tooltip when you hover over an XO shows you theirnick, avatar and stored name?
