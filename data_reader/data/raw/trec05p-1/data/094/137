 <http://mailer.free-irewards.com/?sku=608072&store=weather>Norton Utilities™ 2001
Improve your PC's performance. Speed Disk™ optimizes your hard drive by putting your most-needed files near the front of the disk for faster access. That can significantly speed up the loading time of your applications and documents. Subsequent optimizations are even faster, so it's easy to keep your hard drive working efficiently.

Fix Windows problems. Norton WinDoctor™ diagnoses and solves a wide range of Windows problems, from software errors to hardware configuration conflicts. It protects your work by fixing problems that might otherwise lead to data loss, and helps Windows run better by cleaning up problems that occur from everyday use of your computer.

Keep your hard drive healthy. If your hard drive develops problems, it can make your PC run poorly or even damage your valuable data. That's why Norton Disk Doctor™ detects and repairs a variety of hard drive problems. It not only checks the disk's physical surface, but also its directories. 


Stop trouble before it starts. Run Norton System Doctor™ continuously in the background to keep your PC working smoothly every minute it's on. Norton System Doctor finds potential disk and system problems, and in many cases can automatically take proactive measures to prevent a minor problem from becoming serious. The Norton Protected Recycle Bin can help you recover files that you accidentally deleted.


Completely erase unwanted files. Want to make sure that files you erase are really gone-especially ones that contain confidential information? Wipe Info™ permanently deletes the contents of selected files and folders from your hard drive. Use it for peace of mind when you give your old PC or hard drive to a family member or a charity.
