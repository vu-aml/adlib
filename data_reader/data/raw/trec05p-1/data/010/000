Attached is the recently developed Policy recommendations.  There are 8 title subjects:   Those  of you able to attend our last meeting, recall the form and discussion on 
the issues using this title-topic-basis and consideration bullets.  I have inserted the considerations that we discussed or agreed to include. Please review and circulate your comments to the group.  A consolidated narrative document (with 8 titled policies) will be forthcoming.  Please anticipate that Monday, at the latest.  Please mark your calendars for Monday July 30, at 1-4 PM in 15C1.  We will be working to finalize the recommendations to HR Leadership as well as establishing the next steps.  Regards, Rj
