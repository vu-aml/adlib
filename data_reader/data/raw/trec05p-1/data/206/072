Changing the Order of the Tab and Group Stops by Jeffrey J. Mayer

If you’ve ever wanted to change the order in which your cursor moves from
field to field when you press the Tab or Enter keys, this tip is for you.
What you’ll want to do is change the Tab Stops or the Group Stops.

This is how you do it:
1. Select Design Layouts from the ACT! Tools menu.
2.  Select Edit, Field Entry Order, Show from the menu bar to display
 the Tab and Group Stops within the layout.

 Within each field on the layout two little gray boxes appear at the
 field's right-hand edge. The Tab Stop box has a number that
 designates its position in the Tab Stop sequence. If a field is set
 as a Group Stop, a red dot appears in the gray box just to the left
 of the numbered Tab Stop.

3.  Click the number on the fields whose tab order you want to change,
 and the number disappears.

 ACT!Tip: If you double-click either the Tab Stop number or the
 Group Stop sign, the Object Properties dialog box appears. Click
 Cancel to make it go away.

4.  Click the fields in the new order in which you want the cursor to
 move when you press the Tab key. ACT! inserts a new number.

Adding and removing Group Stops is just as simple. To add a Group Stop,
just click the Group Stop button, and the red dot appears. To remove a
Group Stop, just click the Group Stop button, and the red dot disappears.

Here are some additional things you can do with Tab and Group Stops:
* Clear your Tab and Group Stops: Select Edit, Field Entry Order,
 Clear. Then click the fields in the order in which you want the
 cursor to move when you press the Tab or Enter keys.
*  Reset your Tab and Group Stops: Select Edit, Field Entry Order,
 Reset. 
*  Hide your Tab and Group Stops: After you set your Tab and Group
 Stops, you can make them disappear by selecting Edit, Field Entry
 Order, Hide.

This tip was provided by Jeffrey Mayer, and is excerpted from his newest
ACT! eBook "Customizing Your ACT! Database". To order and download Jeff's
new ACT! & Business eBooks "Growing Your Business With ACT!", "Getting
Organized With SideACT!", "ACT! Power User Tips" and "Opening Doors with a

ACT! Fanatic User Stories

Thanks to so many of you for sharing how ACT! helps you run your day and
your business.  Here are a few stories from ACT! Fanatics that will give
you ideas to help make ACT! work even better for you.

Why I'm an ACT! Fanatic from Alex K.

“We have been a faithful ACT! user since 1997. We have been able to
customize our ACT! user fields to meet our very specific business needs. We
are able to organize all of our customers by group and easily create
specialized mailings targeting any group we have created. We also use the
scheduling feature in a network situation, so all of us are able to
schedule service calls from any one of the network stations. As a database
manager, ACT! is second to none and without a doubt has made our business
more profitable and easier to operate.”

Why I'm an ACT! Fanatic from Robert F.

“Among other things, I use ACT! for sending out faxes and e-mails to
promote concerts for the choir I am in.  Because ACT! integrates with
WinFax Pro and Word, I can create a template for the notice in Word, sort
out which media contacts I want to send the notice to in ACT!, merge the
two and have the notices sent automatically with WinFax Pro.  After the
faxes are sent, I have a report detailing the job including which faxes
were not received.  Integrating ACT! templates with Word really simplifies
a lot of my work and saves me a lot of time.

Why I'm an ACT! Fanatic from Dennis K.

ACT 2000! is my ONE STOP--it's the place where I access my database, keep
my calendar in order, handle my e-mail and faxes, track my sales efforts
... and NOW, thanks to these cool "add-ons,"  I can effectively download
data quickly via egrabber and listgrabber, send e-mails in HTML form, and,
transfer info to my Palm Pilot.”
