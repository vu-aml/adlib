Dear Beth & Sally,

I just spoke with Mike J - due to competing priorities and the current environment, Michael Brown feels that there should not be any London Doorsteps in Q4 and is discussing this with Buy and Causey.  I don't have any information on either of their responses to Michael, I'll let you know if I hear anything.  

I haven't told any of the doorsteppers that their visits may be postponed.  Currently, most of the doorsteps are scheduled for the week of Nov. 5. 

In regards to the doorstep I am going on (Warsaw, Recycling, Frankfurt Cont Power & Gas) Mike agrees that one should still continue.

Regards

I understand from Mike that Michael Brown is currently in discussions regarding Doorsteps in London during Q4. Once I know the outcome of those I'll get back to you.

Regards

Can I then suggest that Paul and Christina co-ordinate this information from the EAS perspective

Dear Andrew-

London Metals has been selected to be reviewed under the "Doorstep" process the week of Nov. 5.  The process involves a review of the current market issues as well as an operational review of the front/mid and back operations.  The doorstep team will consist of Brenda Herod, a member from RAC and an Andersen staff member.  I am helping facilitate the process.

In order to start this process, I need to get a few items from you:

A list of traders and Orginators who can help our team gain an understanding of the current Metals business
A list of mid/back office personnel whom that we could talk to help us understand the existing control structure and management reporting as well as anyone else who we might need to meet with that you feel would or could add value to the process
A population of deals and transactions over the last 10 -12 months that will allow us to start pulling our sample for deal testing
Any other material that you may have that would allow us to do some pre-reading prior to our visit in order to help our understanding of the Metals business.

We will be working closely with EAS/Andersen to ensure that we are not duplicating efforts.  

Please advise as to how would be the best way to schedule interviews - would you prefer that we contact the individuals that you identify for interview or should we coordinate that process through someone in London.

Thank you for your help.  If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me at (713)853-1781. 

Regards,
Christy Lobusch
