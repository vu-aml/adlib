FROM THE DESK OF SAMUEL EZE
TEL: +27-83-431 0008

The Director

Sir,

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me  since you do not know me personally, the purpose of my introduction is that, I am , the first son of JAMES EZE , who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe.  I was furnished with viable information from the International trade Center here in South Africa and in support with the chamber of commerce the same South Africa (JHB) hence l decided to write  you.

Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$25.5 Million (TWENTY FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND United States Dollars), in one of the private security company, as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe.  This money was deposited in a box as germ stones to avoid much demurrage from Security Company.  This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and established of new farm in Swaziland.

This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduce a new Land Act reform which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some 
few blacks farmers.And  this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society.  In fact, a lot of people were  killed because of this land reformed Act for   which my father was one of the victim.

It is against this background that, I and my family who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my father's money to foreign account since the law of South Africa prohibit a refugee (asylum 
seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction througout the teritorial zone South Africa.  As the eldest son of my father, 
I am saddle with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government 
who are bent on taking everything we have got.  The South African government seems to be playing along with them.  I am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in South Africa for fear of going 
through the same experience in future since both countries have similar political history.  Moreover, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not 
allow such investment as an asylum seeker.

As a businessman, who I have to entrust my future and of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free.  If you accept to assist me and my family all I want you to do for me is to make arrangements and come to Johannesburg  South Africa, so that you can open a non-resident account which will aid us in transferring the money into any 
account you will nominate overseas.  This money I intend to use for investment.

I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction.  Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country.  Whichever the options you want, feel free to notify me I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of 
expenses incurred in the process of this transaction.  If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 25% of the money while the remaining 70% will be for my investment in your country.

Contact or call me with the above telephone, E-mail (samez101@hotmail.com.) or fax numbers on receipt of this my message, while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction.

Yours Faithfully,

SAMUEL EZE

(For the Family)
