No wise man ever wishes to be younger. . Nobody can serve two masters. . As is the gardener so is the garden. .
The squeaky wheel gets the grease. . The early bird catches the worm. . Where observation is concerned, chance favours only the prepared mind. .

Marry in haste, repent at leisure. . What the eye doesn't see, the heart doesn't grieve over. . The darkest hour is before the dawn. .
