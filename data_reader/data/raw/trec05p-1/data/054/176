Least talk most work. 



All promises are either broken or kept. . Nothing is ill said if it is not ill taken. . Love sees no faults. . A good thing is all the sweeter when won with pain. .
Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. 

Don't rely on the label on the bag. 

no more?

Discretion is the better part of valour. . From trivial things, great contests often arise. . An apple a day keeps the doctor away. .
A good conscience is a soft pillow. . Use not today what tomorrow will need. . Take your wife's first advice. .

If you see something you like, take it and make it better. . A drowning man will clutch at a straw. . Leave tomorrow till tomorrow. .
