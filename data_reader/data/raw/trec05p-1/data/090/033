Kenneth,

I'm an associate in EES, and I have been working in Enron for two an a half years.

First I would like apologies if this causes any inconveniences, but I am writing this email to you because I'm quite concern about the latest news about the partnership/CFO  that came out in the last week or so. Me and many of my fellow A/A co-workers as well as other employees do not know what is going on, and speaking for myself, if it's possible for you to let me and everyone else know what the situation is and how are you taking measures to reassure confidence in the marketplace I would greatly appreciate your time.

I assure you that many of my fellow A/A co-workers have confidence in the future of Enron, and I expect that greener pastures will be in front of us very soon.

Many thanks in advance,
Carlos Vicens
