Sarabeth,

Could you change the person that you send the Citizens Insurance Invoice to to the following:

Laynie East @ EB2363B

her phone number is 713-853-3131 and she will be paying the invoice.  If you have any questions, please call me at x30685.

Thanks,

Kim Ward
Manager, West Gas Origination
