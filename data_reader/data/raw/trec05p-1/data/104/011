Latest NFL Player News

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/26/01
Jeffers hopes to return to the field for the first time in 14 months when
the Panthers play host the New York Jets on Sunday. Jeffers, who tore the
anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during in a preseason game
against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2000, said he's been told by the
coaching staff that he'll be activated Sunday for the first time this
season. "They said it looks like I'll be up, so I'm preparing like I will
be," Jeffers said. "I'm excited. It's another step along the way." Keep
Jeffers reserved for now. He will see limited action if plays. 

Ryan Leaf, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Leaf will be the Cowboys' backup QB Sunday. Clint Stoerner has been named
the starter in place of the injured Anthony Wright. 

Clint Stoerner, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Stoerner will start at quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys against Arizona
on Sunday, replacing Anthony Wright, who is out with a chronic sprained
knee and could face season-ending surgery. We wouldn't advise using
Stoerner as the starting QB on your Fantasy squad. He has played just three
games in his two seasons with Dallas, but was 4-of-7 for 44 yards and two
touchdowns against Philadelphia this year. Ryan Leaf will be the No. 2
quarterback for Dallas. 

Edgerrin James, RB IND - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
James hyperextended his left knee in the fourth quarter of Thursday's game
at Kansas City. He did not return, and was replaced by Dominic Rhodes, who
scored the Colts' final TD on a 77-yard run. James remained on the
sidelines after leaving the game but said his knee should be fine for the
Colts' next game on November 4. 

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/25/01
Alexander suffered an injury to his ribs prior to Thursday's game vs.
Indianapolis. He did not play, and Larry Parker and Marvin Minnis saw most
of the work in two receiver sets.

James Hodgins, RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Hodgins is suffering from a toe injury and is questionable for Sunday's
game against New Orleans. He won't be used much in the Rams offense even if
he is healthy. 

Dave Stachelski, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
The Saints released Stachelski Wednesday. He caught just one pass this
season for five yards. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Bennett missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable on the
injury report. He is making progress in his recovery, but his owners should
reserve him on their roster. Head coach Dennis Green hasn't given any
indication that he will use Bennett this week. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Heap is optimistic about playing in Sunday's game against the Jaguars.
However, he has been inactive since Week Two and is listed as questionable
on the injury report. Consider reserving him this week. 

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/25/01
Thomas has been named the starter for Sunday's game. He has a case of turf
toe but the injury is not considered to be serious. Thomas is listed as
probable on the injury report. 

Kevin Swayne, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Swayne will start at wideout in place of the injured Wayne Chrebet.
Consider using Swayne if you need a third receiver to start this week. 

Reggie Swinton, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Swinton is still recovering from a hamstring injury and will be
re-evaluated after practice on Thursday. Swinton won't have much Fantasy
value if he is healthy. 

Dedric Ward, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Ward has been ruled out of Sunday's game at Seattle. He is still recovering
from a foot injury. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/25/01
Allen practiced Wednesday but remains questionable for this week's game,
according to <i>The Baltimore Sun</i>. Jason Brookins will start Sunday if
Allen is inactive. 

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01
Brookins has a minor shoulder injury but is expected to play this Sunday.
He might actually start this week in place of the injured Terry Allen.
Nevertheless, he is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/25/01
Sharpe is recovering from a leg injury but is expected to play in Sunday's
game. He is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Freddie Jones, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/25/01
Jones has a sprained ankle but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is
listed as questionable on the injury report. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01
Ward missed practice Wednesday because of a foot injury but is expected to
play in Sunday's game. He is listed on the injury report as probable. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01
Galloway's status for Sunday's game will be determined after Thursday's
practice. He is suffering from a foot injury that he suffered in the
Cowboys' previous game. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01
Batch was given the day off Wednesday, because of a sore arm. However,
<i>The Detroit Free Press</i> reports that he is still expected to play
Sunday against the Bengals. 

O.J. McDuffie, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Don't expect McDuffie to play again this season. The <i>Miami Herald</i>
reports that he is still suffering from pain in his surgically repaired
toe. McDuffie missed most of last season as well because of the injury. 

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Wilkins will not play in Sunday's game. He has been ruled out because of
broken ribs. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/25/01
Pathon will miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a
sprained right foot. Rookie Reggie Wayne will replace him in the starting
lineup. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/25/01
Glenn's status for Sunday's game is uncertain, according to <i>The Boston
Globe</i>. He did some running but did not practice Wednesday. Glenn is
still recovering from a hamstring injury and the Patriots want to see how
his leg holds up before activating him Sunday. 

Drew Bledsoe, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
<i>The Boston Globe</i> reports that there is a possibility that Bledsoe
might be able to fill in as the emergency QB Sunday. Although he is still
under his playing weight, he has begun throwing and doing individual
passing drills. 

Chad Morton, RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Morton might be able to play this Sunday, according to <i>The Bergen
Record</i>. He has missed the past three games because of an ankle sprain. 

Marco Battaglia, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Battaglia is listed on the injury report as probable. He has a calf injury
but is expected to play in Sunday's game at Detroit. 

Chad Johnson, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Johnson is making progress in his recovery from a broken clavicle, but
<i>The Cincinnati Enquirer</i> reports that he will be sidelined for
several more weeks. Ron Dugans will fill in as the third receiver in his
absence. 

Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Sanders has responded well to back treatment and might play Monday,
according to <i>The Nashville Tennessean</i>. However, Sanders is used as a
third receiver on a run-oriented team and won't be too productive even if
he is healthy. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/25/01
Wheatley did not practice Wednesday because of a wrist and knee injuries,
but head coach Jon Gruden told <i>The Contra Costa Times</i> that he is
making progress. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the
Eagles. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/25/01
Johnson ran in the morning and afternoon but did not practice Wednesday,
according to <i>The St. Petersburg Times</i>. Johnson is recovering from
hip and thigh injuries but is expected to play Sunday. 

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/25/01
Green is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Minnesota. He is
recovering from a groin strain. Frank Murphy will replace Green at receiver
if he is unable to play. 

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/25/01
Dunn participated in running drills Wednesday and did not have any setbacks
in his recovery from a toe injury, according to <i>The St. Petersburg
Times</i>. Nevertheless, Dunn is still listed as questionable for this
week's game against Minnesota. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/25/01
Hillard is suffering from soreness in his surgically-repaired foot,
according to the <i>New York Newsday</i>. The foot was sore following the
Giants game against St. Louis in Week Five but it is even more sore now.
Keep an eye on this situation. This condition might force Hilliard to the
sidelines if it intensifies. 

Damon Jones, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Jones' status for this week's game is questionable, according to <i>The
Florida Times-Union</i>. He missed practice on Wednesday because of a
shoulder injury. Kyle Brady will get most of the looks at tight end if
Jones is unable to play. 

Elvis Joseph, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Joseph took a lot of snaps in practice Wednesday and will be incorporated
in as the third-down back, according to <i>The Florida Times-Union</i>.
Joseph won't have much value in this job but he will take carries away from
starter Stacey Mack. 

Tyrone Davis, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Davis could return from his hamstring injury sooner than what was
originally expected, according to published reports. He might begin
practicing next week and will almost certainly be activated before his
target date of Thanksgiving. Davis has been sidelined since August because
of hamstring surgery. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/25/01
Grbac will likely be a game-time decision for Sunday's game, according to
<i>The Baltimore Sun</i>. He threw very little in practice and is still
suffering from a sore chest. Randall Cunningham will start if Grbac is
unable to play. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01
Moss is suffering from tendonitis in his left Achilles tendon, according to
<i>The Pioneer Press</i>. Moss missed practice Wednesday but is expected to
play on Sunday. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 10/25/01
Martin might be ready to play when the Falcons resume their season on
November 4. He has been sidelined for the past four games because of a
broken collarbone but the <i>Atlanta Journal-constitution</i> reports that
he ran routes on Wednesday and caught some passes. 

Wane McGarity, WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
The Saints have signed McGarity, who was released by the Cowboys earlier
this season. McGarity will be used mostly on returns, but he might
eventually work his way into the Saints' regular rotation of receivers. 

Matt Stover, K BAL - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01
Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent him from kicking off but he
will be able to kick field goals, according to published reports. The
injury isn't considered serious but the Ravens are considering Steve
Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs. 

Eric Metcalf, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
The Washington Redskins signed Metcalf on Wednesday. He will be used mostly
as a returner and has minimal Fantasy value. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Biakabutuka will be out until at least training camp with a fracture and
other structural damage to his right foot. "He's not going to be really
ready to do any work that would be football related until next summer,"
coach George Seifert said Wednesday. "Basically, it just separated,"
Seifert said of the top part of Biakabutuka's foot. "The ligaments, tendons
and bone broke, so it all had to be put back together." Richard Huntley,
who will replace Biakabutuka in the starting lineup, visited his teammate
at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said the injury was far worse than he
expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play again. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/25/01
Stewart will probably play on Sunday against the Bengals. The <i>Detroit
Free Press</i> reports that his ankle injury has now been identified as a
bad bruise and not a sprain. 

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/25/01
Chrebet, the New York Jets' top receiver, will miss Sunday's game at
Carolina with a head injury. He was hit in the helmet by St. Louis Rams'
defensive tackle Brian Young on Sunday and left the game complaining of
dizziness. It was the second consecutive week that a head injury knocked
Chrebet out of the game. He left the Jets' win over Miami in the second
half on Oct. 14. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as
"post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the
injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was
given. Laveranues Coles will be the top receiver in his absence. Rookie
Kevin Swayne will move ino the starting lineup. 

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01
Davis disputed rumors that he may have a stress fracture in his leg and
could be lost for the season. "At this point in time, I'm on schedule to
play this Sunday," Davis said. Davis, who has missed five games this year
and 29 since 1999, admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has
been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks. He remained
on the scout team Wednesday as the Broncos prepared for this week's game
against the New England Patriots. Davis was listed as questionable on the
weekly injury report. Don't bother to start him. His abilities will be
limited if he does play Sunday. 

Clint Stoerner, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Starting quarterback Anthony Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of
fluid on his right knee, and might not play Sunday. Head coach Dave Campo
said Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf, if Wright isn't ready to
play. Using Stoerner in your starting lineup would be a risky move.
Stoerner, a second-year player from Arkansas, has never started in the NFL.
He has played in only three games, completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards
and two touchdowns in his two appearances this season. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01
Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and
coach Dave Campo indicated Wright might not play Sunday. Wright expected to
have results of an MRI exam Thursday, and Campo said he wouldn't make a
final decision on the quarterback's playing status for the Arizona game
until after that. Campo said Clint Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf
if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Campo said there was a good chance
that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Sunday. Leaf apparently hasn't been
with the team long enough to merit a starting spot yet. 

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/24/01
Davis is sufficiently healed from a knee injury, but now his lower left leg
is giving him problems and will probably keep him out of action this week.
X-rays revealed no stress fracture, says the <i>Denver Post</i>, but Davis'
leg is throbbing. Mike Anderson will retain the starting job for now. If
Davis is able to play, which seems unlikely, he will be very limited.

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/24/01
According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe
Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer
caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a
reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last
season, in an effort to motivate him. 

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/24/01
Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach
Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and
said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet
passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced
by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League
and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40
straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL. 

Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after
receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are
looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending
injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job.
Don't bother picking him up.

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/24/01
Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for
Monday's game against Tennessee.

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/24/01
The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn
patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
The New York <i>Daily News</i> says there is still a noticeable hitch in
Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect
him to return is Dec. 2.

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/24/01
Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on
the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/24/01
Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting
lineup. But the <i>Kansas City Star</i> notes Chris Thomas is still working
with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which player
will start on Thursday against the Colts.

Larry Foster, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 10/24/01
According to the <I>Detroit Free Press</I>, Foster is expected to start in
Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an
inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right
now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks.

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments
in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you play
in a keeper league.

Neil Rackers, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
According to the <i>Cincinnati Enquirer</i>, the Bengals worked out three
kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is
a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play.

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/24/01
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He
will be evaluated on a day to day basis. 

Ron Dixon, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress
in his recovery and might play this week.

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/24/01
Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to
the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's
absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a
chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer.
Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside
Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines. 

Reggie Swinton, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for
Sunday's game against Arizona. "He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on
Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will
be available," said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib
Ismail will get more playing time in his absence. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/24/01
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the
Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He
is recovering from a sprained foot. "We're expecting some limited practice
tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it
will depend on how he improves the next two or three days," said head coach
Dave Campo. 

Darrin Chiaverini, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game
against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/24/01
Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any
problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game. 

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>Tacoma News Tribune</I>, Seahawks Head Coach Mike
Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as
he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. "We'll cross that
bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I
didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he
got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would
suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again." If you have the roster
room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure
you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost
the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy
rosters at this point.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game
against Miami, according to the <I>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</I>. He
replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with
a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a
Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at
Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the
concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Dedric Ward, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss
Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point
in the season.

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected
to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of
Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend
you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is
hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this
week.

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a
sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken
ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback
game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided
whether they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the
Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't
recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain
he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>St. Petersburg Times</I>, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring
strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the
week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish
it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled
late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11
carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to
post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster
allows for a solid replacement. 

Joe Nedney, K TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this
week. 

Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury.
However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 10/23/01
Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's
game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in
this week's game. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's
game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
<i>The Tennessean</i> reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back.
The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment
options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to
play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder
showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status
for next week's game remains uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to
week, they increase his exercises and change of direction," head coach Tom
Coughlin told <i>The Florida Times-Union</i>. "It remains to be seen when
Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well
this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return
date] next week." Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his
groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to
play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told <i>The Baltimore
Sun</i> he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game.
Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained
ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at
running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against
Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. "I'm day-to-day. I'm
feeling pretty sore in the chest area," Grbac said Monday. "There could be
something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown
a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see." Randall Cunningham will
replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York
Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game
against New Orleans. 

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</I>, Canidate is expected to
start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. "I
wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game," coach Mike Martz said.
"He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to
let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play." Canidate proved
himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be
starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close
to being completely healthy. "Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was
a blessing for me because I was able to get treatment every day," Stokes
told the <I>Contra Costa Times</I>. "I practiced today good. I wouldn't say
I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close." Stokes has been less than mediocre,
however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to
be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants'
starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on
Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his
surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a
sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game
against New Orleans. "I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week
ago," Martz said. "I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this
game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to
let him play." Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is
he's unable to go. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Wright is expected to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling
in his right knee. Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so
starting Wright from a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable.
