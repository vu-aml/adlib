LABOR SECRETARY CHAO URGES FORUM TO KEEP OPEN MIND ABOUT
ERGONOMICS

Labor Secretary Chao defends her decision to hold a series
of forums on ergonomics and predicts that no matter what
approach the department takes, "we're going to make somebody
unhappy." The truth of that statement is evident as
organized union protesters greet the first forum with
placards calling on the Labor Department to issue a standard
to protect workers and criticizing the scheduling of
hearings. "The issue isn't about whether we should deal with
ergonomics injuries, it's about how we deal with them," Chao
says.

Pat Cleary of the National Association of Manufacturers says
the best ergonomics approach is one based on more scientific
research, more emphasis on best practices, and more clarity
regarding what is and is not work-related. He urges the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration to create a
clearinghouse of best practices. Eric Frumin, health and
safety director for the Union of Needletrades, Industrial
and Textile Employees, testifies that ergonomic programs
work for both employers and employees. Good ergonomics
programs improve productivity, reduce medical and disability
costs, and improve product quality, he says.  . . . Page

IBEW MEMBERS RATIFY ACCORD FOR 5,500 WORKERS AT NIAGARA
MOHAWK

A 40-month contract covering some 5,500 hourly employees at
Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. is narrowly approved by IBEW
local 97 members. In the final package, union negotiators
agree to adjustments in some benefit areas to free up
resources for other benefits that the local deems essential
to the membership, As a result, retirees will be paying
somewhat more in health premium costs, and the short-term
disability benefit and separation allowance are both now
less generous.

 An initial 3.25 percent general wage increase is
retroactive to the June 1 effective date of the agreement
with a further 3.25 percent next June and 3.75 percent in
2003. The job security provision. remains in the contract
and will apply to all employees currently on the payroll.
The provision assures employees with at least 10 years
service, whose jobs are abolished, an alternative position
at the same rate of pay. The language will not apply,
however, to employees hired after ratification.  . . . Page

STUDY SHOWS HIGH REVERSAL RATE FOR PLAINTIFFS' EEO VICTORIES

A disproportionate number of employment discrimination cases
won at trial by plaintiffs are reversed on appeal when
compared to cases won by defendants, according to a new
report by two professors at Cornell University Law School.

The study, by Theodore Eisenberg and Stewart Schwab,
maintains that from 1988-1997, 43.61 percent of plaintiff
trial victories were reversed in federal appeals courts,
although only 5.8 percent of defense trial verdicts were
overturned on appeal. The study also indicates that the gap
between reversal rates of plaintiffs and defendants is
larger for employment discrimination cases than any other
category of cases, including civil prisoner cases.

Speaking at a press conference to release the study, Schwab
says, "benign explanations for the large gap in reversals
are hard to come by" and argues that there is a "nationwide,
double standard" when it comes to reviewing claims brought
under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, and the Americans with
Disabilities Act. The study was commissioned by two law
firms that represent employment discrimination plaintiffs. .

COURT SAYS YAHOO! MUST REVEAL TO COMPANY IDENTITY OF
ANONYMOUS POSTER

An Internet service provider must disclose to a New Jersey
biopharmaceutical company the name of an anonymous Internet
user who, describing herself as a "worried employee," posted
confidential information about the employer on the ISP's
finance message board, the New Jersey Superior Court rules
("Immunomedics Inc. v. Jean Doe, a/k/a "moonshine _fr,"
"N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div.,  No. A-2762-00T1,  7/11/01).
Although anonymous Internet speech ordinarily is protected
under the U.S. and New Jersey Constitutions, there was
sufficient evidence that plaintiff Jean Doe compromised that
right by breaching Immunomedics Inc.'s employee
confidentiality agreement by posting the messages, Judge
Fall decides.

In a separate case decided the same day, Fall affirms a
trial court's refusal to grant a similar motion requiring
Yahoo! to disclose to Dendrite International Inc. the
identity of an anonymous Internet user who posted allegedly
defamatory statements about that company's financial
dealings. Dendrite failed to show that the unidentified
Internet user--who may or may not have been a Dendrite
employee--posted any information that harmed the company,
the court ruled ("Dendrite Int'l Inc. v. John Doe No. 3,
"N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div.,  No. A-2774-00T3,  7/11/01). . .

SALOMON SMITH BARNEY AGREES TO BIAS SETTLEMENT

The investment brokerage firm Salomon Smith Barney Inc. will
pay $635,000 and offer salary increases and enhanced
promotional activities to a class of computer employees
claiming employment discrimination on the basis of race and
national origin, according to the terms of a settlement with
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission approved by a
federal judge "(EEOC v. Salomon Smith Barney Inc.
"S.D.N.YNo. 00-7402settlement approved 7/12/01).

The commission sued Salomon Smith Barney on behalf of 13
current or former employees of the company's Greenwich
Street Data Center in lower Manhattan, who alleged that they
were subjected to disparate treatment and to a hostile work
environment because of their race or national origin. Five
named plaintiffs, who EEOC identified as being African
American, Haitian, Nigerian, or West Indian, charged that
they and similarly situated employees had been subjected to
"repeated and offensive comments that created a hostile work
environment." . . . Page A-11
