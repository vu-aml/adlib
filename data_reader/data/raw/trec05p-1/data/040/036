SBX 1 (Soto/Scott) The bill passed out of the Assembly Revenue and Taxation
Committee, as amended, on a party line vote.  The bill now goes to
Appropriations.  Amendments should be available tomorrow.

SBX 78 (Polanco) - The Governor's office called a meeting earlier today of
the business community to discuss a strategy for moving SBX 78 out of
Appropriations and off of the Assembly floor.  The Governor asked that the
business community try to get support from Republicans.  Assemblyman
Leonard, who was the lone Republican to vote for the bill yesterday, is
meeting with Republicans now to try and get their support.  It is widely
held that his rationale for voting for the bill was because he was concerned
that if the bill did not get out in its current form, liberal Democrats
would have amended the bill to look more like the original bill. This is
likely the reason why they need Republicans now.  Assembly session begins at
8:30 a.m. tomorrow and Appropriations will be held off the floor.  Language
is still not available.
