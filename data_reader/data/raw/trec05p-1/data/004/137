Gerald,

In case he does not get back to me, could we please put together execution copies of this form for Brian Redmond's (Jean's on vacation) signature for us to take over to visit Chuck at 8:30am tomorrow morning?

Thanks,

Chuck,
 
Per our discussion last week, you will find attached a confidentiality
agreement regarding our interaction.  Please review and let us know if
you have any modifications.  If not, we will bring executable copies
with us on Friday morning.  Thanks in advance for your cooperation.
 
Chris
