   Word of the Day for Friday April 5, 2002:

   proclivity \pro-KLIV-uh-tee\, noun:
   A natural inclination; predisposition.

     New  York  City  is  full  of  people  like  Mr.  O'Neal --
     life-long  bibliophiles with a proclivity for accumulation,
     holed  up  in  compact  spaces  in  the intimate company of
     thousands upon thousands upon thousands of books.
     --"For  Some,  Acquiring  Books  Has  Become a Compulsion,"
     [1]New York Times, July 6, 1997

     Those  close  to Clark from childhood were not surprised at
     how   quickly   he   recognized   the  lucrative  financial
     opportunities commercial announcing afforded, for Clark had
     demonstrated a proclivity for entrepreneurship as a youth.
     --John  A.  Jackson,  [2]American Bandstand: Dick Clark and
     the Making of a Rock 'n' Roll Empire
     _________________________________________________________

   Proclivity  comes  from  Latin  proclivitas,  from  proclivis,
   "inclined," from pro-, "forward" + clivus, "a slope."
