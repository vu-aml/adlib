MR.SIMON WONG
DAH SING BANK LTD.
DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,
CENTRAL HONG KONG,
HONK KONG.



I am Mr.Simon Wong, credit officer of the Dah Sing Bank Ltd.I have a 
concealed business suggestion for you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war, 
our client General. Hassan Fazi who was with the Iraqi forces and also 
business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, 
with a value of Fourty Three Million,Six Hundred Thousand United 
State Dollars only in my branch.Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent 
and still no response came from him. 

We later find out that the General and his family had been killed 
during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.
After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Hassan 
Fazi did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including 
the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last 
time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. 
So, Fourty Three Million,Six Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still 
lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it What 
bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my 
country at the expiration three years the funds will revert to the 
ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the 
funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like 
you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen.Hassan Fazi so that you 
will  be able to receive his funds.

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we 
shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will 
prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin 
to Gen.Hassan Fazi ,all that is required from you at this stage is for you 
to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney 
can commence his job. 

After you have been made the next of kin,the attorney will also fill 
in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and 
letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account 
that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the 
matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare 
all the necessary documents.

Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning 
this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank 
account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 
5%for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation.
Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax 
numbers for easy communication, you can write me via my private box 
thus:(mrsimonwang@myway.com) and i will provide you with more details of 
this operation.

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards

Mr.Simon Wong
