   Rand,
         I concur with Steve's question relative to whether there are any
unacceptable provisions in the draft, "draft" permit or the need for any
modifications.   I also agree with Steve that we should anticipate an
administrative challenge to the permit by   Coconut Creek or other such
municipality.    In light of such a potential challenge, please contact me
to discuss any weaknesses in the proposed permit.
         Thanks !  Kerri

B each ERP


The discharge into Independence Lake might be challenged by Indy
Bay/Waterways/etc. - the existing agreement only allows ~2/3 of the
property to drain to the lake.  I agree with your assessment of
sufficiency/standing, however, Coconut Creek has been and most likely
will continue to be relentless in their pursuit to delay the project.

Are there any recommended changes to the draft?  

Please keep the team apprised when the 30-day clock starts.

Thanks,
Steve
