What was the 5,790 adjustment?  I don't think I knew about that.  What is the total balance sold now?

Hi Jim,
I am working on getting more support for the July GL storage adjustment of 5,790 MMbtu.  I have the support for this months adjustment of 24,368 and have reflected it in schedule 6.  Do you want Schedule 6 without the 5,790 adjustment or wait until I have that allocated in the sched.?
Thanks
