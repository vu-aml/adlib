Rob,

Thanks. I am copying Jim on the entire exchange.

I realize things are hectic at Enron but they have been for some time
now and my payments can no longer be delayed. I think no one wants to
assume responsibility for this and that's why I am writing to you and
Jim because the delay is really reaching break point from my standpoint.
These are contractually agreed upon payments and they are not days or
weeks late but MANY MONTHS late. I really need to receive the payments
in a matter of days.

All the best and look forward to hearing from you.

Diomedes.

Dio -

I think Jim's email address is jim.derrick@enron.com.  I haven't heard
back
from Mary Joyce on any of this.  In fairness to her, things are a little
hectic over here right now.  Thanks.

Rob

   Rob,

   I've not been able to follow this to Jim ?I must be misspelling his
   name. Can you please do so and also send me his email address?

   Thanks,

   Diomedes.

   Jim and Rob,

   I hope you are both doing well. I realize that you must both be
   extremely busy with other more important issues but I find myself in
a
   position that I HAVE to raise the issue described in the email below
to
   your direct attention. The email is self explanatory but the bottom
line
   is that not only has Enron failed to make payments that are due to me
   and to one of my companies for MONTHS now but  the company is not
even
   responding to my requests for information.

   I would highly appreciate it if you advised me on the best way to
handle
   this, i.e WHO do I need to talk to who has the decision authority to
   make the payments and give me answers. I stress once more that the
   unjustified delays by Enron in making these payments is already
causing
   me serious  problems and potential losses.

   I look forward to your response.

   Thanks and hope to see you soon.

   Diomedes.

   Mary Joyce,

   I hope all is well with you.

   I am contacting you regarding a number of late payments by Enron
which
   have now become urgent from my standpoint. These payments refer to
   contractual obligations between ECI (one of my affiliate companies)
and
   Enron and to the Employment Contract between Enron and myself. The
   payments have been invoiced and they are months late now.

   After questioning John Novak about the status of these payments
(after
   leaving Enron I was told by Rob Walls to send all invoices related to
   the ECI and to my agreement with Enron to John Novak in Enron South
   America) I received a voice mail from Pam Buttler, who I believe
works
   with you, informing me that I would have to wait until early
November,
   maybe even until late November as the "changes in management at Enron
   require that all contracts be reviewed by the Compensation Committee
   which would convene in early or late November".

   As soon as I received this message last Wednesday I left a message
with
   Pam and also a voice mail with you and I subsequently left two
messages
   with your assistant asking you to contact me urgently regarding this
   very serious matter but as I have not heard from you I am writing
this
   email to make sure that my position is clear.

   These payments are due by Enron based on existing contracts and I see
no
   reason why I have to wait for a review by an internal Compensation
   Committee. These payments are already significantly late and I have
been
   extremely patient with continuous delays in payments due to me by
Enron
   up to now. Moreover I have repeatedly let Enron know that I am in the
   process of closing a transaction which depends on receiving these
   payments, otherwise I would incur costs by unwinding other positions
   that I have. I need these payments to be made no later than
Wednesday,
   October 24.

   Please inform me of Enron's intents so that I can take all the
   appropriate steps to enforce my contractual rights.

   I look forward to hearing from you,

   Regards,


   Diomedes Christodoulou.
