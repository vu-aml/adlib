As discussed in our staff meeting yesterday, the 2001 PAA Program will end effective December 3, 2001.  Any and all PAA/American Gift Check requests must be received on or before November 30 to allow time for processing.  

In addition, the total remaining balance may now be shared by all division heads.  The current balance as of the 11/13/2001is $126,950.00.
