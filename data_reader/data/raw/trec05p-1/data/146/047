This Subscription Agreement governs use of Dow Jones Interactive (including, but not
limited to, the Dow Jones Business Newsstand, Dow Jones Publications Library, Dow Jones
CustomClips, Company & Industry Center, Historical Market Data Center, and Dow Jones
Web Center sections).  If you have been authorized to access The Wall Street Journal
Interactive Edition, this Subscription Agreement also governs use of Barron's Online,
as well as The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition.  When used in this Agreement,
"Interactive Journal" means Barron's Online, and The Wall Street Journal Interactive
Edition, and "Service" means those parts of Dow Jones Interactive and the Interactive
Journal which you have been authorized to access.  If you download, install, or receive
Dow Jones Interactive software that you use or can be used to access the content, this
Agreement also applies to that software (the "Software").

By clicking the "I Accept" button, or using the Software or any part of the Service,
you are representing that you are 18 years old or older, and that you agree to be
bound by all of the terms in this Subscription Agreement.  You may print and keep a
copy of this Agreement.  Dow Jones may change the terms in this Subscription Agreement.
When the terms are changed, Dow Jones will notify you by e-mail and/or online postings.
The changes also will appear in this document, which you can access at any time by clicking
on Help "?", then Subscription Agreement (for Dow Jones Interactive) or by selecting Help,
then Subscription Information, then Subscriber Agreement (for the Interactive Journal).
By accessing a Service or using the Software after Dow Jones has notified subscribers of
a change in the Subscription Agreement, you agree to be bound by all of the changes.

PRIVACY OF INFORMATION

By clicking the "I Accept" button, you also are agreeing that Dow Jones may store
information you provide as part of the registration process and usage information,
and provide aggregate statistical information about subscribers to advertisers,
potential advertisers, and content licensors.  Dow Jones also may use the information
to inform you about other Dow Jones publications, products and services, unless you
notify Dow Jones that you do not wish to receive this information.  Dow Jones also
may deliver additional messages about the Service or Software to you by e-mail.

As a general policy, Dow Jones does not disclose to third parties any specific
personal identifying information about you, such as your name, address, phone number,
or email address ("Personal Identifying Information").  Dow Jones will not disclose
any of your Personal Identifying Information to a third party without first notifying
you and giving you an opportunity to elect not to have your Personal Identifying
Information disclosed.

ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS

If Dow Jones and you or your employer have manually signed a paper version of a
contract governing your use of the Software or the Service, or if you or your
employer subscribe to the Service pursuant to an Enterprise Subscription Agreement,
the terms in that manually signed, paper document or Enterprise Subscription
Agreement are not amended by, and supersede, terms in this Subscription Agreement.

FEES AND PAYMENTS

You can always find the current Subscription Fees and charges posted in Pricing "$"
(for Dow Jones Interactive) or in Help, under Subscription Information (for the
Interactive Journal).  Your subscription will continue and renew automatically
until terminated by Dow Jones or until you notify Dow Jones by telephone or
electronic mail of your decision to terminate your subscription.  You agree to pay
or have paid all fees and charges incurred in connection with your user name or
password at the rates in effect when the fees and charges were incurred.  All
fees and charges are nonrefundable.  Dow Jones may charge late fees on overdue
accounts, and you agree to pay or to have paid all costs (including, without
limitation, attorneys' fees) incurred to collect overdue amounts.  Dow Jones may
change the Subscription Fees and charges then in effect, or add new fees or charges,
by giving you notice in advance.

All fees and charges incurred in connection with your user name or password will
be billed to the credit card you designate during the registration process for
the Service or the electronic information service which provides you access to
the Service (or, if agreed in advance by Dow Jones, billed by paper invoice.)
If there are any annual, monthly, daily or similar periodic fees for your Service
subscription, these fees will be billed automatically to your credit card at the
start of the annual, monthly, daily or similar period, and at the start of each
renewal period, unless you terminate your subscription before the relevant period
begins.  If you want to designate a different credit card or there is a change
in your credit card validity or expiration date, or if you believe someone has
accessed the Service using your user name or password without your authorization,
you must call Dow Jones Customer Service at the telephone numbers posted in Help
"?".  You also are responsible for any fees or charges incurred to access the
Service through an Internet access provider or other third party service.  YOU,
AND NOT DOW JONES, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT
CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, WHICH WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU.

If Dow Jones and you or your employer have manually signed a paper version of a
contract governing your use of the Software or the Service, or if you or your employer
subscribe to the Service pursuant to an Enterprise Subscription Agreement, some or all
of these "Fees and Payments" terms may not apply to you.  Please contact your employer
for details.
