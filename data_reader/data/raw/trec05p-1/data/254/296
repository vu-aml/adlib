We were not paid by either cornerstone Propane or Midamerican for these deliveries.

I had a letter that needed to be sent out today so I left early.  This is what I need and you can tell me what the process is.

ENA purchased gas from TDC (sitara #1143983) in the month of December 2001 on NGPL.  It appears that we scheduled the gas on an NGPL IT agreement to the NGPL LA Pool.  At the pool, it appears that we made some sales 
	Deal 1184526 Cornerstone Propane, L.P.
	Deal 1184587 MidAmerican Energy Company
	Deals 258085 and 315861 to Enron MW, L.L.C.  - desk to desk deals.

Did Cornersone pay ENA for the gas?
Did MidAmerican pay ENA for the gas?
How do these desk to desk deals work?
Did any of this goes go to cash out or did ENA go short and cash out?

Not a rush but I would like to have an answer by next Friday if possible.

Thanks

Please work with Energy Operations to determine where it went and if we sole it or if is still on the pipe.  The priority should be based on your judgment.

Ed, this gas was nominated on an IT contract into a pool on NGPL.  I am unable to identify the gas after that so its difficult for me to tell if the estate benefited.  Let me know what you want to do at this point.

Thanks

Assuming all of what is below is all correct, it appears that TDC is
entitled to payment.  The question with administrative priority is whether
the the estate benefitted.  If we took the gas, I assume that we did.
THanks.

3/6/02 2:30 PM just spoke with Louis Schott (504-529-3630  Sr. Vice
President & General Counsel for TDC) - TDC has not filed a claim with the
courts at this time.  TDC is trying to avoid the administrative expense and
expects to be paid $203,196.00.  I told him I would call him back Friday
afternoon and give him a status update.  Please let me know what I can tell
him.  This was an ENA deal.

>     Summary:  TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00
from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001
(sitara deal #1143983).  TDC stated that it would "file a claim for
administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all
other necessary relief against ENA" if ENA did not remit payment by the
close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it
appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.
>
>     Kay, Ed, Question:  I have not contacted TDC to determine if they
have filed a claim with the court.  Would that have any impact on making a
payment to TDC?  Should I contact TDC?

>
>     Calculation of Post-Petition Payment using Dec 3 as Post-Petition day

So I just need to verify with you  we TOOK this gas by nominating it.

Counterparty wants payment for post-petition gas delivered to Enron.
Please advise if you need commercial involvement.  Thanks
