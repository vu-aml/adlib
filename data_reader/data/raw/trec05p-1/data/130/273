Kim,
I agree with the three people on the list as those we should consider.

Carolyn Brown has had interest in the Board, but she is seldom on the same
page as other people commonly are, and when she was on the board when Ken
chaired it, almost everyone pulled their hair out after being in meetings
with her.

Houshyar talked with Ken about his interest in being on the board, and both
Houshyar and I told Ken that it is not a problem for both of us to be on the
board at the same time.

More later as thought come to me.

Paula
