1. Sound Off: Europe's ban on hate speech
2. Ask the Expert: E-government
3. Tech Tact: Ultradense computing
4. CIO Legal: Perils of a dotcom wind-down
5. CIO Opinion: E-commerce can still work
6. Are you involved with CRM or ERP?

1. Sound Off: The question of whether the U.S. should support
Europe's ban on Internet hate speech is a loaded one indeed.
Europeans are concerned that homegrown bigots will "outsource"
their racist websites by moving the hosting to American ISPs.
U.S. First Amendment advocates argue that a ban on hate speech
will start us down the slippery slope toward censorship. Should
the U.S. support the ban?

2. Ask the Expert: Donald Upson, secretary of technology for the
Commonwealth of Virginia, is available to offer his insight
and advice on the challenges of e-government.

Center at:

3. Tech Tact: Whether they're single rack-space slices that
hold a handful of CPUs or a slice design that packs hundreds
of identical single-board computers into a rack, ultradense
servers are all about saving money by reducing real estate
needs and cutting power requirements.

4. CIO Legal: If you have the misfortune of being the CIO of
a dying dotcom, you can and should address several issues in
order to minimize the impact of its failure.
http://www.cio.com/legal/edit/111201_dotcom.html

5. CIO Opinion: We've heard plenty - perhaps too much -
about the dotcom decline. But there are still good ideas
out there and, despite all the doom and gloom, this
e-commerce thing can still work.

6. Are you involved with CRM or ERP?
Share your experiences by rating the leading systems
integrators and software packages. You'll also receive
