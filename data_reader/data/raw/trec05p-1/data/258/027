desire a purchasable thing. All I want is, I want to stand right in front of you so close that we feel our breaths hitting our faces, our hearts listen to each other's beats, our eyes play together, your whispers vibrate my body, and I, taking your hands into mine, thrusting our fingers together, taking a deep breath, would scream so loud that all the tiredness inside me, all the sadness vanishes in the air."
