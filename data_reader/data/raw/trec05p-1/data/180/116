Investment ideas 
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Broadband providers hit the canvas
DSL has fumbled the ball and cable has hit the deck, but the ref 
hasn't counted them out...yet

By Ben Macklin, senior analyst, eMarketer

It has been a tough year for broadband access providers in the US.  
On the digital subscriber line (DSL) front, wholesalers Rhythms 
Net Connections (RTHMQ), North Point and Covad 
(COVD.OB) hit the canvas.  Covad is in the process of getting 
back on its feet, but its future remains uncertain.  On the cable side, 
Excite@Home recently filed for bankruptcy, and numerous 
broadband wireless providers including Winstar and Metricom 
have also dissolved.  But what lies ahead for those that survive?

While DSL technology has fumbled the ball early in the game and 
is now unlikely to ever live up to its promise, cable and satellite 
providers still have a chance to run for daylight. But for the time 
being, dial-up remains the clear market leader.

Indeed, eMarketer predicts continuing growth in the dial-up sector, 
at least for 2002, even though broadband services will become 
more widespread. Dial-up will taper off in the following years, but 
it will still be the most common means of Internet access in the 
home even as late as 2004.  AOL, with its 26 million subscribers 
(not counting Road Runner) as of September 2001, will continue to 
dominate the scene. Its nearest competitors, MSN (7 million 
subscribers), United Online (6.1 million subscribers) and 
Earthlink (ELNK) (4.9 million subscribers) will battle it out for 
second place.  Even if the largest five ISPs after AOL merged, they 
would still fail to rival AOL Time Warner (AOL).
