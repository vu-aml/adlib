<span class="line">Greetings fellow Insiders,<br>
<br>
Y' know, sometimes the most challenging thing about putting together the Insider is figuring out how to stuff all the groovy new ImageStation features into a single newsletter. This issue is no exception, as we've added a plethora of goodies, and mouth-watering deals to the site. <br>
<br>
Most notably, you'll want to check out the premiere of the ImageStation Magazine our new Photo Greeting Cards by Hallmark Stories, and free shipping on select cameras purchased by November 30th. You'll find details on all this and more tips, tricks and offers than you can shake a turkey drumstick at below.<br>
<br>
All the best,<br>The ImageStation Team<br><a href="mailto:editor@imagestation.com">editor@imagestation.com</a><br><br></span>

	<img src="http://a1060.g.akamai.net/f/1060/597/30m/www.imagestation.com/images/insider/common/tnt_topbracket.gif" width="163" height="25" border="0" alt=""><br><br>
		<span class="line">	<b>Proper Props</b><br></span><img src="http://a1060.g.akamai.net/f/1060/597/30m/www.imagestation.com/images/insider/volume_01/issue_05/kids.jpg" width="163" height="126" vspace="5" border="0" alt="">
<span class="line">Terrific props are usually available and can greatly add to the overall atmosphere and theme of your picture. This is an especially nice touch for holiday photography - for example, the inclusion of the pumpkin pie in the image above strengthens the concept of a festive family feast, and enhances the photo's sense of fun and whimsy.</span>
<br>

<br>
<span class="line"><b>Time to Reflect?</b><br></span>
<img src="http://a1060.g.akamai.net/f/1060/597/30m/www.imagestation.com/images/insider/volume_01/issue_05/nasa.jpg" width="163" height="126" vspace="5" border="0" alt="">
<span class="line">Always be aware of your reflection or shadow in the picture. Sometimes it's a distraction, and sometimes it adds greatly to the image. You may recall the famous shot of astronaut Buzz Aldrin in full space walking garb complete with reflection of fellow astronaut and photographer Neil Armstrong. (Photo Credit: NASA)</span>
<br>

<br>
<span class="line"><b>Let There Be Light</b><br></span>
<img src="http://a1060.g.akamai.net/f/1060/597/30m/www.imagestation.com/images/insider/volume_01/issue_05/sunrays.jpg" width="163" height="126" vspace="5" border="0" alt="">
<span class="line">If you're shooting on an overcast day, wait for the sun to dart through the clouds. According to meteorologists, this happens, on average, in spurts every two to three minutes. You typically get a thirty-second opportunity for a more interesting and illuminated image.<br></span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="line"><b>Member Suggestion (NEW!)</b><br>
If you don't want to invest in, or carry a large flash diffuser for steady shots, try using a 'space blanket' instead (available at most camping stores). They're lightweight and very inexpensive, and the reflective Mylar surface is perfect for bouncing a light source on to your subject. - Jim Best<br>
