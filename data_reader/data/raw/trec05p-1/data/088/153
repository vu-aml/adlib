Restoring GA
	
FEDS FREE FIRST OF 41,000 STRANDED AIRPLANES
Most VFR pilots near five major cities were able to take to the air last Monday morning, following the release of a notam late Saturday night. Five more cities were opened Tuesday and an additional five on Wednesday. "AOPA's staff has been working almost 24 hours a day to achieve this first goal," said AOPA President Phil Boyer. "The efforts of AOPA members, along with other general aviation organizations, have helped to free the first of the GA 41,000." A special edition of ePilot was sent early Sunday to pilots in and near the affected areas. AOPA's staff will be focusing now on restoring flight privileges in the remaining 15 enhanced Class B areas and the Washington and New York temporary flight restriction areas (TFRs). AOPA is also working toward gaining approval for news and traffic reporting, banner towing, ! and sightseeing operations to resume operations in enhanced Class B (ECB) airspace.

FAA PUTS ONUS ON NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL
An FAA representative told the House aviation subcommittee Wednesday that while the agency is working on plans to reopen the 15 remaining ECB areas, they can't do so without concurrence from the National Security Council and the Department of Defense. This clarifies the much disputed question as to who is making the decisions regarding the reopening of ECB to VFR traffic. Steve Brown, FAA associate administrator of air traffic services, received pointed questions from members of the committee. He said that the FAA has been working hard with members of the general aviation industry, such as AOPA, to remove the restrictions. But committee members believe the lifting of such restrictions should have come long ago. North Carolina congressman and AOPA member Robin Hayes said to Brown, "Just fix the problem, will ya?"

NSC CONSIDERS PROPOSALS 
The National Security Council met Thursday to consider FAA plans for restoring operations in the remaining 15 ECB areas. The FAA's presentation considered recommendations made by a coalition of general aviation groups for easing restrictions on VFR flying. AOPA, EAA, GAMA, HAI, NATA, NBAA, and NASAO developed consensus recommendations addressing aircraft and airport security and airspace operations.

AOPA ASKS CONGRESS FOR HELP
AOPA again Wednesday reminded Congress that the airspace around 15 major cities remains closed to VFR pilots. "The problem is not yet solved. With each day that passes, some 65,000 pilots and nearly 21,000 aircraft at 132 airports, and the businesses that support them, continue to be affected in 15 areas. These VFR operations must be restored," said Andy Cebula, AOPA senior vice president of Government and Technical Affairs, testifying before the House aviation subcommittee. In addition to the business losses caused by the continuing restrictions, Cebula said that individual aircraft owners were facing average fixed costs of $2,400 a month whether the aircraft flies or not. See AOPA Online <http://www.aopa.org/whatsnew/newsitems/2001/01-4-044x.html>.

CONGRESSMEN INTRODUCE VFR RESTORATION BILLS
House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Don Young (R-Alaska) introduced Wednesday aviation security legislation that includes a provision that requires that any notam, regulation, or order that restricts the ability of Part 91 aircraft to conduct operations in ECB airspace shall cease to be in effect 10 days after the bill is passed. This provision is similar to the bill also introduced Wednesday by Rep. Bob Filner (D-Calif.) that would require the FAA to develop a plan to allow VFR flight in the remaining 15 ECB areas where it is currently prohibited. Filner said his legislation "requires the FAA to have a specific timeline for opening up these closed airports. National security is paramount, but we must also find a way to allow this backbone of American transportation to resume flying."

FAA MAY GRANT PROFICIENCY, INSPECTION EXTENSIONS
As a follow-up to informal discussions with FAA officials, AOPA formally requested that pilots and aircraft owners directly affected by the enhanced Class B flight restrictions and the TFRs be given relief from the regulations governing instrument proficiency, flight reviews, and certain aircraft inspections. In particular, AOPA asked that the FAA extend the due date to November 30 for those whose pilot proficiency or aircraft inspections were due on or after September 30. Relief was also requested on behalf of our military personnel serving overseas. The FAA recently told AOPA that granting the requested relief was possible with certain modifications. A final decision is expected early next week. See AOPA Online <http://www.aopa.org/whatsnew/newsitems/2001/01-4-026x.html>.

SAN DIEGO CITY COUNCIL VOTES TO CONTROL AIRPORT
AOPA's two-year-long opposition to a privatization plan for San Diego's Brown Field Municipal Airport succeeded when the City Council voted unanimously to maintain local control of the airport. It will help secure the future of general aviation at Brown Field. The field was one of five airports nationwide scheduled to be privatized-that is, sold or leased to a private developer-under a congressionally ordered demonstration program. But the plan for Brown Field would have harmed GA. See AOPA Online <http://www.aopa.org/whatsnew/newsitems/2001/01-3-166x.html>.

FAA GOES AFTER CITY FOR $50,000 LANDING FEES
The FAA set last Saturday as the deadline for the town of Islip, New York, to drop a recently enacted $50,000 nighttime landing fee at Long Island-Mac Arthur Airport. The fee violates a federal funding agreement prohibiting unjust discrimination. As recently as early September, AOPA said the town "ignored us" when asked on several occasions to discuss nighttime curfew issues.

PILOTS ARE SOUGHT TO TEST FSS ENHANCEMENTS 
The FAA is seeking volunteers to participate in a research program involving the aviation digital data system (ADDS). The test, to be conducted at the FAA's William J. Hughes Technical Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey, will study the potential for conducting interactive weather briefings for pilots utilizing the flight service system. The program will take place from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. from November 6 through 8. Pilots need only participate for one of the days, and no prior experience with the system is needed. This is an opportunity to be involved in an important safety and service enhancement for the general aviation community. AOPA has been a long-time advocate of providing official weather information over the Internet. AOPA staff members will also be participating in the study to evaluate future member benefits.
