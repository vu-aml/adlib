Before we carry this much further, let me explain some more why I raised the question in the first place.

We currently assume that our exposure to CTC going forward is zero.  Arthur Andersen was questioning this assumption, as market prices in general are lower than embedded gen now (unless you include DWR costs), which implies that if we were under the old CTC regime we could be paying some positive CTC.  AA was wondering why we weren't holding some reserves for this eventuality.

Mary Lynne and I told them we weren't reserving b/c we just have no clear idea what will happen in the coming months re:CTC, but that in all likelihood zero is the best guess b/c no one can agree on what PX credit ("market" price) is now that there is no PX.  Besides, though SCE and PG&E are arguing for different methods (the so-called "top-down" and "bottom-up"), in the end the result will be about the same (CTC=0), especially now that PG&E has supposedly stopped "adjusting" the PX credit to recover past undercollections.  And of course, the DWR contracts muddy the waters, since if one includes them in the calculation of utility gen costs, then you could easily get to a negative CTC situation.  Bottom line: we think things are so screwed up that everyone will prefer just to ignore CTC for the few months remaining that it has to run.

In light of all this we thought we might further quell AA's skepticism if we could show that although we had once argued that DJI should be used as a substitute for PX credit, we were now simply arguing that DA should pay T&D only, and that CTC should become a relic of the past.

I think by now it may be a dead issue -- I believe AA has accepted our arguments w/o this extra bit of persuasion, else I would have heard more from Mary Lynne.  Thanks for all the background and input from everyone, and please let me know if you have any more relevant comments given this context.
