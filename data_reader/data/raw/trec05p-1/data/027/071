AIRLINE ILLEGALLY CONSIDERED FMLA LEAVE IN FIRING, NINTH
CIRCUIT SAYS

An airline that fired a passenger service representative
based in part on the 16 sick days she took during the early
months of 1996 violated the Family and Medical Leave Act by
impermissibly considering FMLA-protected leave in making the
termination decision,  the Ninth Circuit rules ("Bachelder
v. America West Airlines Inc.,  "9th Cir.,  No. 99-17458,
8/8/01).

Reversing summary judgment for America West Airlines and
ordering summary judgment to plaintiff Penny Bachelder, the
Ninth Circuit rules that the airline failed to inform its
staff of the method it used to calculate the 12-month period
in which employees are entitled to take 12 weeks of FMLA
leave. Where an employer fails to notify employees of its
method for calculating leave eligibility, the method that is
most beneficial to the plaintiff should be used, Judge
Berzon writes. Applying a "calendar method," the court
determines that the leave that Bachelder took in 1996 was
protected under the act. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-11

RNS' REFUSAL TO VOLUNTEER FOR OVERTIME REQUIRED NOTICE, NLRB
SAYS

The New York State Nurses Association violated the National
Labor Relations Act by failing to issue a 10-day strike
notice when it directed its members to refuse to volunteer
for overtime at Mount Sinai Hospital, the National Labor
Relations Board rules in a 2-1 decision ("New York State
Nurses Ass'n, "334 N.L.R.B. No. 103, 7/27/01 [released
8/1/01]).

Overturning a decision by an administrative law judge, the
majority finds that nurses who refused to volunteer for
overtime work at the union's request and those who refused
assigned overtime were engaged in a concerted refusal to
work. The majority makes it clear that it is not suggesting
that employees could not concertedly refuse to work
voluntary overtime. Rather, it says, such a refusal must be
preceded by the issuance of a 10-day notice if a union is
responsible for the action. . . . Page A-1,  Text E-1

FOUR CURRENT NLRB MEMBERS DISCUSS MAJOR RULINGS, JUDICIAL
CRITICISM

The four current members of the National Labor Relations
Board discuss their views on past and future issues before
the board, criticism by the appeals courts, and the board
during the Clinton era during a session at the American Bar
Association's annual meeting.

The board's decisions in "M.B. Sturgis Inc." and "Jeffboat
Division, American Commercial Marine Service Co., "
involving temporary workers give rise to complicated
bargaining situations, "but I think collective bargaining is
vibrant enough, if done in good faith, to achieve results,"
NLRB Chairman Hurtgen says. Part of the difficulty in
situations involving temporary workers is created by the
unions and employers themselves trying to decide whether
including or excluding temps is to their side's advantage,
he adds.

 Hurtgen says the board's unanimous ruling in "Lee Lumber
and Bldg. Material Corp." "reflects a good result of board
decisionmaking" in which the board tried to fashion "an
easy-to-use rule" in an area that involves "unstable,
difficult factual analysis." He speculates that future
boards may fashion similar rules in other situations where
good faith bargaining is ordered.

When asked about a spate of recent D.C. Circuit decisions
that have been rather critical of the board's
decisionmaking, Member Liebman observes that any board
member needs to develop either a thick skin or a sense of
humor. "I'm concerned by the disdain and contempt for board
decisionmaking" shown in certain appeals court rulings,
Liebman adds. . . . Page C-1

NMB DISMISSES AMFA PETITION FOR UNITED MECHANICS

The National Mediation Board dismisses a petition from the
Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, an independent
union seeking to replace the International Association of
Machinists as the bargaining agent for more than 15,000
United Airlines mechanics and related employees.

AMFA's petition for a representation election was dismissed
"due to an insufficient showing of interest" among the UAL
employees to support the independent union, the NMB says.
Action on the AMFA petition opens the way for resumption of
contract talks between United and IAM District 141-M for the
mechanics group. . . . Page A-9,  Text E-19

POWELL UPDATES U.S.-MEXICAN GROUP'S IMMIGRATION DISCUSSIONS

Secretary of State Powell says that the U.S.-Mexican working
group studying immigration issues has begun exploring "some
specifics with respect to a temporary guestworker program,"
but that it is "in no hurry" to issue recommendations on the
matter. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Mexican
officials at the State Department, Powell stresses that
establishment of a new temporary worker program has to be
"done in a careful way, a way that will be seen as fair and
equitable by ... the people of both nations."

The group is looking to fashion a system that "is grounded
in reality and the needs of our economy, one that doesn't
hurt U.S. workers," he says. The program "will rest on a
carefully worked-out partnership between the sending and
receiving countries, one that recognizes also the
contributions that undocumented Mexicans are making in the
United States and that brings together willing" workers and
employers.

 A new guestworker program is one of a number of immigration
reforms U.S. and Mexican officials have been discussing
since President Bush and Mexican President Vicente Fox
agreed last February to establish the working group. . . .

STAGE SET FOR CONFEREES TO ADDRESS PATIENTS' RIGHTS
LEGISLATION

When Congress returns in September from a month-long recess,
the ongoing fights over how to craft provisions expanding
patients' access to legal remedies will continue, but the
battleground will shift to a conference committee of House
and Senate representatives.

Predictions vary on what the outcome of a House-Senate
managed care conference will be. The Senate-passed
legislation (S. 1052) provides far more latitude for
patients to sue their health plans than that afforded in the
House bill (H.R. 2563), which passed with the approval of
the Bush administration. Bush has said he would veto the
Senate-passed bill. . . . Page B-1
