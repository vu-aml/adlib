Conoco and Tesco Unveil New Drilling Technology

  

    Conoco and Tesco will construct 3 innovative drilling rigs using 

Tesco's proprietary Casing Drilling technology. The drilling rigs 

will operate under an exclusive contract to Conoco for 2 years. Pilot 

testing shows the technology sharply reduces drilling costs and 

speeds well completion by using the conventional casing instead of 

drill pipe to drill the well. The companies say that Casing Drilling 

is safer and eliminates the time-consuming trips necessary to change 

drill bits and set casing. Tesco will operate the rigs for Conoco to 

conduct a 2-year development drilling program in Conoco's South Texas 

Lobo natural gas trend. The first rig is expected to be operational 

by September 1st. The other 2 rigs will be ready to begin work by 

year end 2002. Tesco says that wells drilled with Casing Drilling can 

be drilled up to 30% faster than conventional wells.
