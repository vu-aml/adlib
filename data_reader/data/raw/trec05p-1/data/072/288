Hello All,
Attached are two updated reports.  These include the revised Utilization Analysis and AAP Goal page for the Associate/Analyst program based on the report Alicia recently sent to me.

Based on her report, the Associate, Professional and Analyst job group numbers have been changed to reflect the numbers in her report.  The Professional job group includes the job titles of Junior Specialist, Non Applicable, and Specialist.

The revised report indicates that a new goal has beed identified for females in the Associate pool.  Availability is at 33.64% and current utilization is 21.10%.  At the current utilization rate, a shortfall of 13 females exists in the Associate pool.  This is a change from the 
1-15-01 report.   

Please let me know if you have any questions with regard to these reports.  I can be reached at x37921.
