The subject line of this email is hardly news.  How
have companies toughed out past downturns and gone
on to succeed?  What did it take in terms of leadership,
strategy and execution for companies to continue growing
and prosper in past downturns?  What were the key
differentiators in sales and marketing, human resource
and financing success?  As you know from the last email
I sent you, the VentureWire Executive Summit on November
6 in San Jose plans to get the answers to these and many
other questions.  We’ve called together a superb roster
of speakers and panelists who have built companies in
difficult times, and positioned them well to ride past
upturns.  How will organizations need to be structured
to be ready for when the current market rebounds?  Where
is the money to be had until that rebound happens?

Our roster of speakers are supremely well-qualified to
answer these and other pressing questions.  Take a
moment to scroll down and see who is speaking and
participating at VentureWire’s Executive Summit.  By
clicking on their photos, you will be able to read their
profile and track record.  You’d be hard pressed to find
so much talent under one roof anywhere else:
