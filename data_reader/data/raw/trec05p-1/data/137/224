To our customers and counterparts:

As of Sunday, November 18 our OASIS and E-tag servers are running on PPT.
The only business practices we are changing now, is that our OASIS
transmission products are all based upon PPT.  Our scheduling system/e-tag
server is also running on PPT.  However, we can and will continue to accept
e-tags in any timezone, as long as the profile has a valid OASIS
reservation.  We will also continue to check out with our counterparties in
the time zone that we have historically used with each neighboring control
area.  

The cost?  $4.79 for a tall, skinny latte' and a plain bagel with light
cream cheese for our programmer.

If you have any questions, please give me a call at 208-388-2243.

Thanks,
Lisa
