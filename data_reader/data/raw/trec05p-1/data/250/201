Jennifer -

I haven't heard from Sam, so I don't know her status.  She got the same
e-mail everyone else did, so if I hear from her, Kim will give her an
assignment.

I'm forwarding your message to Kim so she can answer your question about the
pear dish.  We have not made it before, so I can't answer your question.

John

John,
Do we know if Sam is coming?  I am wondering on my assignment for the pears.
Also, have you and Kim made this before?  Would it be OK to make the pears
and sauce ahead of time or shall I bring it for preparation?
Thanks.
Jennifer

> Ingredients:
> 1 head garlic
> 1/2 teaspoon olive oil
> Instructions:
> Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Chop top 1/5 of garlic head (from the
pointy
> tip).  Discard any extra garlic skin, leaving most of it intact.  Place
> garlic head in a medium sized piece of aluminum foil.  Pour olive oil on
top
> of garlic.  Wrap foil around garlic, encompassing the entire head.  Bake
in
> oven until the garlic is golden brown and the garlic pulp is easily
removed
> from its individual shell (around 40 minutes).  Remove from oven; let
cool.
