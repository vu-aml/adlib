Good morning!
 
We now have some new pipes on production that need to show up in qviewer
 
efms-dcaf2
irfx-dcaf2
gcp-livelink
gcp-eim
 
That means that all efms, irfx, dcaf2, gcp, livelink and eim queues need to be visible in qviewer.
Today or tomorrow, I'll give you a list of who needs access to those queues.
Thanks,
Shawna
