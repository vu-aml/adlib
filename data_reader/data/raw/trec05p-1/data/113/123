Ford Introduces Co-Fueled Clean Diesel Focus
Ford Motor Company recently introduced a new diesel-powered research vehicle that will meet California's ultra-low emission vehicle II (ULEV II) standards. The company said the vehicle features a "co-fueling" process that combines diesel fuel and urea -- an ammonia-based compound -- to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. 

"Ford Motor Company strongly supports introducing cleaner, more fuel-efficient diesel vehicles in key markets around the world, including North America when the timing is right," said Ford advanced diesel systems group corporate technical specialist Dick Baker. 

The automaker said the ULEV II diesel-powered Focus produces extremely low emissions as a result of its NOx reduction catalyst and a soot-trapping particulate filter. The catalyst uses a water solution of urea sprayed on the catalyst to remove NOx from the exhaust. 

"Co-fueling with urea in a common-rail diesel engine allows us to produce a vehicle that provides the performance and fueling process customers are accustomed to," said Baker. 

Ford said the ULEV diesel-powered Focus features an advanced common-rail diesel engine with refined calibration that provides "superior engine performance, drive quality and fuel economy." 

"This prototype vehicle is an example of what could be done to make future diesels fully comparable to gasoline vehicles in emission control, with lower [carbon dioxide] (CO2) emissions and excellent fuel economy," said Baker.
