D.C. CIRCUIT OVERTURNS NLRB DECISION ON WORKPLACE CONDUCT
POLICIES

A California firm's two workplace policies barring abusive
and threatening language and restricting solicitation and
distribution did not constitute unfair labor practices, the
District of Columbia Circuit rules, overturning a National
Labor Relations Board decision ("Adtranz ABB Daimler-Benz
Transp. N.A. Inc. v. NLRB, "D.C. Cir., No. 00-1282,
6/26/01). The board held the workplace conduct policies of
Adtranz ABB Daimler-Benz Transportation N.A. Inc. interfered
with employees' exercise of their rights under the National
Labor Relations Act. The board ordered that a second
election be held to determine whether Adtranz employees in
Pittsburg, Calif., wanted to be represented by the
Machinists Automotive Trade District Lodge 190 of Northern
California.

The appeals court finds it lacks jurisdiction to consider
Adtranz's appeal of the order for a new election, because it
is not a final order. The court rejects the board's view
that the ban on abusive and threatening language was an
unfair labor practice regardless of whether it actually
chilled employees' exercise of their rights. Judge Sentelle
finds the solicitation-distribution rule is legal because it
"only applies to conduct during working time and in the work
place" and "applies across the board, so it cannot be said
to discriminate against unionization efforts or other
protected activity." . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-1

WORKPLACE PANIC ATTACKS RENDER EMPLOYEE UNQUALIFIED UNDER
ADA

A former customer service worker for a Wisconsin power
company fired after having panic attacks at work that likely
stemmed from a head injury was unable to establish that her
discharge was illegal under the Americans with Disabilities
Act, the Seventh Circuit rules ("Emerson v. Northern States
Power Co.,  "7th Cir.,  No. 00-3746,  6/26/01).

Loretta M. Emerson failed to show she was a "qualified
individual" under the act, given that her anxiety attacks
could interfere with her ability to answer customer phone
calls about gas or electricity emergencies, Judge Bauer
finds, affirming summary judgment to Northern States Power
Co. Bauer also finds Emerson posed a direct threat to her
employer, because her job "required prompt, accurate
handling of emergencies such as gas leaks and downed power
lines that could pose significant danger to the public." . .

UAN DELEGATES VOTE UNANIMOUSLY TO AFFILIATE WITH AFL-CIO

Delegates to the National Labor Assembly of the United
American Nurses, the labor arm of the American Nurses
Association, unanimously vote to affiliate with the AFL-CIO.
If all goes as planned, the affiliation of the
100,000-member union will become effective July 1. However,
it appears one more hurdle may need to be cleared before the
affiliation, which has been in the works for more than a
year, becomes a reality.

The ANA House of Delegates is scheduled to vote June 30 on a
bylaw change that would require any state nurses'
association that engages in collective bargaining to be a
member of UAN within four years. This was a condition of the
AFL-CIO granting a charter. It is unclear whether the bylaw
change will pass, and if it does not what happens to the
affiliation agreement. . . . Page B-1

NEW YORK CITY PARTLY IMMUNE FROM BIAS LAW, COURT FINDS

In a case of first impression, a federal trial court
overturns a jury's $1 million sexual harassment punitive
damages award against New York City because it did not
explicitly waive sovereign immunity from punitive damages
under the city's human rights ordinance ("Katt v. New York
City, "S.D.N.Y., No. 95 Civ. 8283 (GEL), 6/19/01). Rejecting
the defendants' other post-verdict motions, however, Judge
Lynch of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of New York upholds the jury's award of $400,000 in
compensatory damages.

The court rejects the city's affirmative defense that
plaintiff Alli Katt failed to take advantage of the New York
Police Department's complaint process, finding that she was
intimidated into not doing so because of explicit and
implicit pressure. The court also rejects the city's
late-raised challenge to the timeliness of the complaint. .

HOFFA, LEEDHAM NOMINATED AS CANDIDATES FOR TEAMSTERS
PRESIDENT

In a noisy but orderly session of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters convention June 28, incumbent
President James P. Hoffa and challenger Tom Leedham both are
nominated for the union's top office.  Also nominated are
current IBT Secretary-Treasurer Tom Keegel and Leedham
running-mate Tom Gilmartin, the head of IBT Local 559 in
Connecticut. Delegate voting will occur late June 28 to
determine if the candidates received the requisite 5 percent
support for their names to be placed on the ballot for the
fall election among the union's 1.4 million members.

That Hoffa will receive 5 percent of the delegates' votes is
a foregone conclusion given his overwhelming support among
the more than 1,700 delegates. Voice votes on various
resolutions and constitutional amendments appear to show
that Leedham has the support of only a few hundred delegates
in his second challenge to Hoffa for the union presidency.
However, Leedham and members of his campaign appear
confident he will get the votes necessary to be placed on
the ballot. Other members of Leedham's slate earlier
received more votes than necessary to be placed on the
ballot. . . . Page C-1

OSHA READIES MANDATORY EMPLOYER SURVEY FOR DISTRIBUTION

The week of July 2 will signal the launch of the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration's annual
mandatory survey of more than 80,000 employers nationwide to
gather injury and illness data to better target high-hazard
employers. The agency, however, will not include
construction employers in the upcoming survey.

The 2001 survey program "improves OSHA's ability to identify
and target our  efforts on the more hazardous workplaces,"
acting OSHA Administrator R. Davis Layne says. The survey
requests calendar year 2000 data. OSHA inspections based on
the 2000 data will not be launched until January or February
of 2002, the OSHA spokesman says.

Employers will be asked to supply figures for average
employment, hours worked, and a summary of the job-related
injuries and illnesses that occurred at their work sites in
2000, the agency says.  The surveys must be returned even if
a surveyed employer recorded no occupational injuries or
illnesses for 2000, the agency says. . . . Page A-1
