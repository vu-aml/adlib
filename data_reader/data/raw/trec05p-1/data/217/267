Kim, 

Those ideas sounded pretty good.  I got a list of places from Lisa also: 

Benjy's (on Dunstan by Ballys) 
Raven Grill (Bissonett) 
Goode Company Seafood 
Sierra Grill 
Floridita Seafood Grill (the place on Kirby/Richmond) 
Tony Mandola's Seafood River Oaks 

Any of these sound good to us.  I think Lisa's preference is to avoid "heavy" places, and go for either a place with variety or something that's more seafood oriented.  However, we're flexible.  By the way, 6:00 p.m. sounds perfect.

Whatdaya think?
