Chip:

As we discussed a couple of days ago, we have prepared a payment direction letter regarding our final payment from AES on the Haywood deal. The letter directs AES to make payment directly to our consultant ($100k) with the balance to us by check ($2,010k).

Please let Kay, Staurt and I know if you're OK with this (via return e-mail), and we will send it to AES. Stuart, Kay and I have each reviewed the letter.

I expect that we should be in a position to receive these funds hopefully late next week.

Thanks,

Ben
