Sally-
If you are not the appropriate party to respond to this inquiry, could you please pass along to the appropriate Enron Net Works person?   With ENW going to Newco, I am not sure who to contact.
FYI, Steve Pruett is a former Enron VP in Energy Capital Resources that left Enron approximately 6 months ago.
thanks,
Jeff

Hello Jeff,

My name is Rich Shane.  Steve suggested I contact you to see if you might be
able to direct me further within Enron.  My company, Digital Integrity, has
a solution for digital data discovery that enables an extremely fast method
to find a large variety of different digital files across an enterprise's
network and email system.

We provide a software solution that is ideally suited to performing
electronic discovery across vast collections of digital documents. The DI
solution allows users to perform discovery wherever their company's
documents might be located.  In addition to finding exact copies, our
solution can discover documents whether or not they have been modified.  In
other words, whether or not the documents have been excerpted or derived
from the original.

For example, we are able to find megabytes of email communication in
terabytes of email messages across a company's entire corporate network.
This can be used as an off-line audit / data mining application using
archived-messages or as an on-line filtering application using "live" (i.e.
outgoing and incoming) messages.  In addition to email, we work with word
processing, spreadsheet, presentation and many other types of documents. We
can show the percentage overlap between source documents and found
documents.  We can show the parts of a document that are similar and
dissimilar down to the word via a side-by-side comparison.  As previously
stated, we can find documents across a corporate network or even on the
Internet.

Attached is a product overview that will give you more information on how we
can help with Enron's data discovery, information security and intellectual
asset management needs.

If you would be willing to forward this message along to the relevant
people, I would be grateful.

Sincerely,
Rich Shane
CEO
Digital Integrity
