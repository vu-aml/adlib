This email, directing the RETENTION OF DOCUMENTS, is being sent to employees who worked on issues relating to the 8K filed with the SEC on April 22, 2002.  In our discussions with the SEC relating to this filing, we have been requested to produce ALL DOCUMENTS that support the filing, relate to the filing, or were prepared in connection with the filing.  

Consequently, PLEASE RETAIN any and all documents, including all drafts, electronic documents, and email, that relate in any fashion to the 8K filing.  Nothing pertaining to that subject should be deleted or discarded.  You will be contacted by Bob Williams in Enron's Legal Department shortly in order to work out the details of collecting responsive documents.  

Thank you for your cooperation.
