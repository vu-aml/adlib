<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Hasselbeck threw for 134 yards, one TD and no interceptions at Buffalo.

He's no better than a reserve Fantasy player at this point, best used when the matchup is right in a deeper league. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1950&key=235239&"><B>Koren Robinson</B></A>, WR SEA - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Robin!

However, with all the injured running backs around the league this season, Dillon is still a must-start on a weekly basis. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1950&key=1069&"><B>Steve McNair</B></A>, QB TEN - Rocks <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
McNair played despite a sore thumb, throwing for 172 yards and a touchdown against Cincinnati. He's been an unreliable Fantasy player this season, and is worth starting only when the matchup is right. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1950&key=1174&"><B>Eddie George</B></A>, RB TEN - Fear <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>George was unimpressive once again, posting only 65 scrimmage yards on Sunday against Cincinnati.

He's put together two straight solid games, and may finally be reaching the potential the coaching staff knew he was capable of. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1950&key=12531&"><B>Peyton Manning</B></A>, QB IND - Tori Kuykendall <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Manning put up a decent performance against New Orleans, posting 262 yards and a touchdown. He may not be putting up Manning-like numbers this season, but he's still far too valuable to ever consider benching. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1950&key=1335&"><B>Marcus Pollard</B></A>, TE IND - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Pollard had a huge game on Sunday, catching three passes for 126 yards and a touchdown against New Orleans. He may not be the most consistent Fantasy player, but the lack of tight end depth around the league makes him a valuable commodity. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1950&key=133361&"><B>Donovan McNabb</B></A>, QB PHI - Eric Bass <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><!
