How Did Hyperion Help Reliant Energy Leverage their ERP and Data Warehouse
Investments?  How did Reliant Energy Address the Consolidation, Reporting,
 Analysis, Modeling, Budgeting and Forecasting Issues that existed within
                                   SAP?

 "Delivered via a corporate Intranet portal, SPARC [Systemized Performance
                               Analysis and
    Reporting Channel] provides: forward looking, integrated financial
   statements ... a repository for variance explanation across forecast
             cycles; and a communicator of performance data."
Commentary by David Michie, Reliant Energy

 From The Data Warehousing Institute's WHAT WORKS, Volume 11 - Case
Studies.url>>

Join us Tuesday, October 30th, 2001 at The Four Seasons Hotel to understand
how Reliant Energy has addressed the major changes in its industry so that
it now has the ability to manage the short-term and long-term business
horizons in a more deregulated world.  Reliant Energy, Arthur Andersen, and
Thinkfast Consulting will present on how Reliant Energy leveraged their ERP
and Data Warehouse investments with Hyperion to create SPARC, their
reporting, analysis, budgeting, forecasting and modeling system.

Prior to Hyperion, according to David Michie, "...previous plan, actuals,
and one-year forecast updates came from separate source systems utilizing
different account definitions and formats, which made comparability and
consolidation  very difficult. This led to analysts re-formatting data,
adjusting links, and modifying formulas. In addition, update-to-update
changes could not be identified on a real-time basis."


 Learn how Reliant Energy leverages Hyperion Solutions to:
ü Reduce its Forecasting and Management Cycle from 8-10 days to 2-3 days
ü Provide a "single version of the truth" for business rules with the
Hyperion Analytic Platform, which has reduced the average decision making
horizon from     indefinite (multiple internal meetings) to minutes or
hours
ü Automate integration with their ERP Package
ü Facilitate reporting, analysis, modeling and planning from multiple data
sources - including ERP, Data Warehouse, Legacy and others
ü Eliminate manual efforts of spreadsheet shadow systems - re-formatting of
data, adjusting links, modifying formulas, etc.
ü Gain an extensible solution that can be leveraged enterprise wide with
the Hyperion Analytic Platform
ü Successfully deliver business value, utilizing partnerships with Arthur
Andersen and Thinkfast Consulting
