                                        Notification of Cash Grant/Donation.

This is to notify you that you have been selected by the Board of Trustees of =
the above International  HIV/AIDS Organization Base in  Spain for a Cash =
Grant/Donation of US$800,000;  Social and Research developments in your =
community mostly On educating people in provention of HIV/AIDS  .According to =
UNAIDS estimates, there here are many different ways in which HIV and AIDS =
affect women . Among them are : 

   were 37.2 million adults and 2.2 million children living with HIV at the =
end of 2004, and during the year 4.9 million new people became infected with =
the virus. Around half of all people who become infected with HIV do so =
before they are 25 and are killed by AIDS before they are 35. 95% of the =
total number of people with HIV/AIDS live in the developing world. But HIV =
still remains a threat to people of all ages and nationalities. Women, Girls, =
HIV and AIDS is the theme of the 2004 World AIDS day. Around the world =
tTransmission. HIV/AIDS has been thought of in the past as a disease mainly =
affecting gay men or drug users. In fact, in 2004, most HIV infections come =
from heterosexual sex. And in heterosexual sex, women are more likely to =
become infected than are men. 

  Mother to child transmission of HIV accounted for 90% of all babies =
infected in 2003. A drug is cheaply available to greatly reduce the chances =
of this occurring, but it fails to be provided to many women around the =
world. HIV can also be transmitted by breast milk, which is easily =
substituted for artificial alternatives =96 also, often unavailable. 

  Sexual violence is an issue affecting women everywhere in the world. It can =
be even more damaging when it involves the transmission, sometimes =
deliberate, of HIV. A new and alarming phenomenon that has been seen in the =
past decade is the use of HIV as a weapon of war. In conflict areas such as =
Rwanda and Kosovo there have been reports of thousands of women being raped =
and purposely infected with HIV as part of a campaign of =91ethnic =
cleansing=92. 

  Discrimination is an issue which has affected women for many decades. It =
can impact on their job prospects, their economic and social position, their =
access to healthcare and education. Women who have HIV may experience =
discrimination on two fronts, and if the healthcare services discriminate =
against them, their lives can be shortened as a result. 

  Men are the most common route of HIV transmission to women. In fact, most =
women infected with HIV have caught the virus from a husband or partner. 

In order for HIV to be effectively tackled on an international level, efforts =
need to be made to 

  End the discrimination against people with HIV and AIDS. 

  Educate people in safer sex and drug use, using appropriate media. 

  Provide condoms freely to people in the developing world. 

  Provide financial and medical assistance so that people with HIV and AIDS =
can be treated. 

Started in 1988, World AIDS Day is not just about raising money, but also =
about raising awareness, education and fighting prejudice. World AIDS Day is =
also important in reminding people that HIV has not gone away, and that there =
are many things still to be done Is giving out Eight Hundred Thousand United =
States Dollars as specific Donations/Grants to 150 lucky international =
