ADS users:

I have received numerous comments from TSWG regarding concerns about the
planned implementation of the same service type for OOS and OOM type
dispatches in ADS phase II .   Market Operations' current position is that
the Market Participants have all the information they need to decode OOS and
OOM, such as what has been bid, what has been dispatched, what proxy bids
have been created based on available capacity, etc.  However, we will
consider a change to separate the OOS and OOM dispatches.  In order to fully
weigh the ramifications of this decision, I want to solicit
examples/scenarios where Market Participant systems would not be able to
correctly settle against a combined OOS/OOM dispatch through ADS.

If you are interested in this issue, please strengthen your case by sending
me an email with comments by 8/16/01.  I would especially like to see
comments regarding how must-offer fits in, including issues with proxy bids
and whether OOM will apply to must offer units.

Thanks,
