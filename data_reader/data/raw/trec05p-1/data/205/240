Vince,
 
We were just notified that all pre-petition wages, including vacation, will be paid up to 15K.  As a result, we are trying to determine how much people should carryover from last year, generally 40 hours is the maximum.  However, if employees were unable to use their vacation last year due to business circumstance (i.e. Mike Roberts group) or is a supervisor acted to limit or cancel and employee's vacation during the course of the year, we will be granting exceptions.
 
I have listed below individuals from your group who have more than 40 hours, and can be considered for this exception.  Please let me know if you would like to approve each of these or not, and your justification.
