Dave, Steve and I talked and due to our schedules and distance from Phoenix, we think it would be most effective if you could represent the company at this BOT meeting.  This is assuming your schedule allows and Jim is on board with one of us attending.  It will be an important meeting with approval of WECC and next year's budget on the agenda.  I am making hotel reservations for you, since today is the deadline.  I think you also need to fill out a form for WSCC; Jenny Remington is the meeting planner.  I will send Dennis Eyre a delegation after I hear from you and Jim.  Ray
