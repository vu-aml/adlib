Hi there,

Trying to decide where to go on your next vacation?  So am I.
Right now, there are great deals everywhere.  Florida, Mexico,
the Caribbean, Las Vegas, Hawaii, California.  All your favorite
destinations.

Now that the cold weather is on its way (there were actually
some snow flakes up north) I'm starting to remember how it was
last Winter.  Wherever I decide to go, it's going to be somewhere
WARM.  Sunny days, warm nights, moonlight walks, good times.

With prices so low, it's the perfect time to make your vacation
plans.  See the sun, have some excitement, travel with your
family and friends.  It's always a good time to travel.  And
whenever you travel, you always have a good time!

Have fun on vacation!

John
