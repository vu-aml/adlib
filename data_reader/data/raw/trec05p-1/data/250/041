From 4:00 - 6:00 p.m.., the Unix Team will upgrade the Time server.  Timex.ect.enron.com which is now on a Unix desktop network will be moved to a production network and to Netra T1 hardware. It would be doing the same activity as Rolex which was replaced on Monday. All clients are now pointing to new Rolex server & Timex.  No impact is expected.  

Mar. 15
From 5:00 - 6:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will replace the switch on the Extranet link HOPIX1.  This change will cause intermittent outages for those external companies using this link to access the Enron Network.

From 8:00 p.m. through 3/17 at 6:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will re-enable the File Replication Service on all Corporate domain controllers.  This change is necessary to replicate security policies.   FRS will be started on Corp DCs one at a time, watching to be sure replication completes.  Brief outages of Corp.enron.com security policies and possibly Exchange may occur.  The Messaging team will be notified if replication causes problems.  Support staff whose applications experience problems due to FRS should contact the solution center at ext. 54745.
Mar. 15
From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Corporate Server team will place Nahou-appr1 into the Corp Domain.  This change will affect applications using the R drive.

It is also possible that messages sent from he Blackberry may be returned.  Returned messages can be resent after the maintenance is complete.
Mar. 18
From 5:00 - 6:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will change the DHCP scopes to update the secondary WINS and DNS entries.  This change will affect workstations that get their IP addresses via DHCP.  All scopes are renewed on a 24-hour basis so all changes should be completed by 3/19.  No impact is expected.

At 5:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will remove access to CORPHOU-DC07 (172.23.226.23, primary/secondary DNS) and NAHOU-NSWN03 (172.23.226.24, primary/secondary WINS) from devices within ECN.   All servers/workstations/equipment using these for WINS/DNS must have their settings changed. Use 172.16.7.120 for DNS and 172.16.7.116 for WINS in their place by this 5/01.
