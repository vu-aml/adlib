I may have mentioned this (too much going on!) but they both did agree to sign. Jeff A. contacted Masha yesterday, took her by surprise...wanted to know if he was the target etc., advised her not to visit with him.

Ryan,
 
The content on this looks good.
 
Style idea -- would it make sense for it to be in the first person -- for them to sign as a statement, instead of in second person as stated by you?  Does that make sense?  That way, they would "own" the statement when they sign it.
 
What do you think?
 
Michelle
