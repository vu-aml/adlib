Subject: [Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Tom Brady to Remain Starter

Entire story:
http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/324/sports/Is_Brady_the_1_+.shtml

Clipped from the Michael Smith article:   FOXBOROUGH - Bill Belichick said
yesterday morning that Tom Brady will start at quarterback Sunday against
New Orleans, then took it a step further in the afternoon, saying Brady will
start Patriots games unless something drastic occurs.

''I think as we move forward here, unless something unforeseen happens that
Tom will be the quarterback, and he'll get the snaps in practice and in the
games,'' Belichick said on the ''Patriots Monday'' show on WWZN 1510.

Yesterday morning Belichick told the media at Foxboro Stadium, ''I don't see
any changes this week. I don't think this is the time to get into a big
personnel evaluation, but I don't see any changes.'' Those comments came
less than 12 hours afte his team's 24-17 loos to the St. Louis Rams.

At the news conference, Belichick was brief with his responses regarding the
quarterback situation, but his comments to Sean McDonough on his weekly
radio show on WWZN gave the indication that Brady will be his starter for
the forseeable future.

That decision likely would not sit well with Drew Bledsoe, a nine-year
veteran and three-time Pro Bowler. Bledsoe sustained a sheared blood vessel
after a fierce hit by New York Jets linebacker Mo Lewis in Week 2, which
opened the way for Brady to start the next eight games. Brady has led the
Patriots to a 5-3 mark.

''Drew hasn't been able to play the last eight weeks ... and Tom's more
game-ready at this point,'' Belichick said on the radio. ''That's the way
we're going to go.''

Belichick reportedly informed the players of his plans last night during the
weekly quarterbacks meeting. Patriots spokesman Stacey James confirmed only
that the meeting had taken place. Normally, it is held on Tuesday night, but
this week's schedule gives the players a day off for Thanksgiving, so it was
moved up.

Attempts to reach Belichick, Brady, and Bledsoe last night were
unsuccessful.

Before this season, Bledsoe signed the largest contract in NFL history,
worth $103 million over 10 years. His compensation for this year alone is
$11.5 million.

Bledsoe was activated for the Rams game - for the first time since his
injury - but watched as Brady threw two costly interceptions before bringing
the Patriots within a touchdown with a 10-yard scoring pass to David Patten
with 7:46 left.

The first interception was a strike to Kevin Faulk early in the first
quarter that bounced off the running back's shoulder pads. Dexter McCleon
was there to make the pick, and the Rams scored the game's first touchdown
three plays later.

You Brady owners can rest a little easier as it looks like he could be the
man.   Nothing with Bill Belichick is ever set in stone so I wouldn't get
too comfortable but obviously, this is good news for you Brady folks or
those looking to snag him for the homestretch run.

Thanks to Footballguy Eric Posty for sending this one to me.
