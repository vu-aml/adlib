Comments from trading track phone interviews:


Fred Baloutch  -  recommendation: invite in for interview  -  excellent academic results, very smart, some summer gas experience with BC gas, did some work with weater derivatives,  very enthusiatic 

Carlos Betancourt  -  recommendation: do not invite for interview - unable to communicate relavent experience.

Seung "Sam" Hyun Cho -  recommendation:  invite for interview ( however, Sam does not graduate until May '02, so Associate program recruiting may be a better fit.)  excellent academic results,  able to discuss a wide variety of subject material regarding trading,  strong understanding of risk and derviatives. 


Please let me know if you need additional information.

Scott

Guys,

You have been selected to complete the telephone screening of external candidates for second and final round.  Each  candidate will be screened by two traders to ensure agreement on quality of candidates.   (these resumes have already been selected from c. 200 resumes by some of the ENA Traders).  

As in the previous Trading Track recruiting event, you will be given a few days to complete this.  The candidates will be expecting your call, there is no set interview time therefore allowing you flexibility to call in the evening from home if necessary.   Resumes, telephone numbers etc will reach your desk tomorrow morning.   All phone screens to be completed by Tuesday pm: 16th October.

Any questions please call myself or Adrianne Engler.

Thanks,

 Karen.
