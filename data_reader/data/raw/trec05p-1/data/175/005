Let me clarify a point about the Performance Evaluation due dates:

The written reviews are due in HR by January 2 (not signed off by employee)

You ARE NOT required to have completed all your employee review meetings by January 2

You can start discussions as soon as you have completed the reviews, but the discussion should focus around performance.

No variable pay or merit discussions should take place in the performance review meeting.  Those will take place on or around January 18.

Please call with any questions.

Thanks and have a great holiday!
