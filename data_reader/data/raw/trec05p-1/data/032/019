style looking for that one last interior.... and it
could be yours, for free!!!!! can this sweet angelic
unemployed girl come over to your pad this evening
(tomorrow evening, etc) to film? the shoot will happen
in one day, we will clean all up, you will get a copy
of the film and the satisfaction of knowing that you
have supported the arts.

or whatever.

i'm fine, enjoying my unemployment, what's up with you
my fabulous friend?
