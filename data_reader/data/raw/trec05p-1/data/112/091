Hello Zhiyong,
	I have implemented an enhancement to avoid the problem of restarting the Sitara EOLBridge when there are missing startdate and enddate.  This fix will take care of this morning's problem.

EOL will be sent a Failed status similar to the following:
	message={EolTransactionId=2101638 TransactionSysDealId="" BridgeEntityName="EOLBridge" Message="Missing StartDate or EndDate" Status="F" BridgeDate="20011025170945CDT"}

I throughly tested the change by sending over 400 sample deals from this morning.  Due to the "Bid Week" window, please approve this  bridge enhancement for tonight's migration.  Thank you.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.
