Grbac has been inconsistent at times this season but should still be an adequate starter during the Fantasy playoffs. Expect him throw for at least 200 yards and a touchdown. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF="http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=673&key=1231&"><B>Marvin Harrison</B></A>, Active WR<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR>

Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual. <BR>

Robinson's prognosis for recovery from surgery to repair two ligaments in his left knee is seven to nine months. That would put him on target to return around the start of training camp next season, but you should check back on his status during the summer.<BR>

Defensive back Bryant Westbrook has been listed as out for Sunday's game against Tennessee. This could mean big things for Steve McNair and the Titans' passing game, who should have an easy time beating Detroit's corners on a regular basis. <BR>

Morris, who is recovering from knee surgery, was not placed on injured reserve by the Chiefs. There is a chance he might be activated late in the year, but it is doubtful that he will help Fantasy leaguers this season.<BR>

Anders, a three-time Pro Bowler, was released by the Kansas City Chiefs Friday. Anders, who had spent his entire 10-year career with the Chiefs, never recorded more than 400 rushing yards in a single season but went to the Pro Bowl as a fullback for his blocking and receiving. <BR>
