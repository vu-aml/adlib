Larry,
I have asked Bob Adams to look into the possibilities of doing something with the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation's High Schools for Habitat Program.  I am especially interested in pursuing something in Arizona with youth in the Phoenix area.  This could work into something proactive for the Sun Devil Project to utilize.  By copy of this email I am requesting that Bob Adams pursue gathering information on whether or not an initiative would work in the greater Phoenix area with this program - while he is discussing the broader application of becoming involved with this program at various locations up and down Tw's pipeline system.  Bob, please also keep Larry informed on your progress as he is responsible for putting the ETS alliance with the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation together.  Thanks again, John Shafer

Carole,

Thanks for your quick reply.  Yes, I am located in Houston, Texas where the Enron and ETS offices are located.

I appreciate the letters you attached and your advising us of your upcoming "Texas campaign."  While our corporate office is in Houston, our pipelines run from Arizona to Florida on the south end, and from Texas through the central US to eastern Montana, the Dakotas, Michigan, and Wisconsin in the north.  However, since we are new to this, maybe a focus on Texas would be a good place for us to start.  I look forward to speaking with you and ask your guidance in how to get started and where we could be of the most assistance.

Bob

Dear Bob,
    As I prepare for yet another year in the "classroom", your email could
not have come at a better time.  It delighted this old teacher's heart and
mind.  Twenty of the upperclassmen who pride themselves on doing the "upper
level" activities of the project were here over the weekend for a
campfire/hotdog roast and planning session.  They are fired up to get
started.  Their youth and enthusiasm has kept me young all these years.
Many of the kids shown in the Bugle pictures were here in my backyard.  They
will be delighted to hear that the article touched your heart.
    Yes, I lead a busy life, but I am never too busy to talk to people like
you who have the same devotion to conservation and youth.  I look forward to
speaking with you via the phone.  Students report on Tuesday for their first
day.  Tomorrow I will be getting my indoor classroom ready but I shall be
home by 4:00 PM EST. Are you located in Texas also?  This may be
coincidental since I am about to embark upon a Texas campaign, sending
information to 300 Project Wild trained high school teachers.
     I promise to call soon.  Thank you for energizing this old teacher and
sending her back to school on a positive note.  The upperclassmen do some
pretty sophisticated writing and speaking.  One of the girls who went to the
Dakotas with me in August, just answered a man's email today concerning the
donation of an item.  For the fun of it, I am attaching the answer she sent
out just today FYI along with a letter the group sent to other habitat
schools before school dismissed.  As you can tell I am very proud of these
kids!   Talk with you soon.  Yours in Conservation,  Carole Biletnikoff
