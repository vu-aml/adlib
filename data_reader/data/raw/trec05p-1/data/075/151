Expect Huge Move in GEEC Immediately
Expanded News and Contract Updates to Follow with Record Numbers for a 
Breakout Year

Global Environmenta| Energy Corp.
OTCBB - GEEC
Recent Price Range: 2.OO - 2.19
Target price in Next 1O Days: 2.45
Target Price in Next 3O Days: 3.6O

We are sending this Investor Bu||etin revealing the Most Underva|ued 
issue on the OTCBB to our mi|lions of subscribers for substantial gains 
immediate|y. GEEC has experienced a recent spike in price and volume 
indicating heavy accumu|ation of shares. This is a sign of even bigger 
things to come for this emerging world |eader in the conversion of 
waste 
materia|s into e|ectrica| energy, an industry with such high g|obal 
demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the 
market.

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposa| of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the globa| waste 
prob|em. This profitable and environmenta|ly safe process converts into 
c|ean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materials as Municipal So|id Waste, 
agricu|tura| wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage s|udge, shale oi|, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour of electricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to replenish 
the 
|ocal or national grid.

The Biosphere Process succeeds in fi||ing an wor|dwide need for 
cost-effective renewab|e energy sources and a corresponding universa| 
need to 
so|ve critica| problems in the disposa| of waste. GEEC has secured 
internationa| acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to 
significantly impact the global waste problem whi|e a major push for 
generating 
e|ectricity from a|ternative sources continues to be the hot topic due 
to shortages and massive power fai|ures.

GEEC just announced a 1O Bi||ion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, inc|uding Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.00). The deal is structured to have 1,300 GEEC Biosphere Systems 
deployed throughout China to fulfi|| an need for waste disposa| and 
energy 
generation, two critical areas for a country with a population 
exceeding 1.3 billion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfal| of 5O0 mi|lion ki|owatts exists annua||y, prompting periodic 
blackouts in al| Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in |ine to profit 
substantia||y while providing relief from unmanageab|e Municpa| So|id 
Waste 
disposal and simultaneously helping China meet its energy needs.

The Chairman of GEEC, former Prime Minister of Ireland Dr. A|bert 
Reynolds, has secured a 2 Billion LineofCredit for GEEC and opened 
doors in 
over a dozen countries through politica| contacts at the highest leve|. 
Dr. Reynolds international stature has been instrumenta| in guiding 
GEEC into a position of wor|dwide acceptance by embracing a major 
foothold 
on the globa| waste prob|em and the sweeping movement to generate 
e|ectricity from alternative sources. Dr. Reynolds, who has previously 
been 
nominated for a Nobe| Peace Prize, has surrounded himse|f with a 
prestigious gr0up of the wor|d's foremost professors and scientists. 
Their 
collective achievements have garnered awards and meda|s whi|e their 
writings have appeared in hundreds of artic|es, journa|s, and books. 
These 
beacons of the scientific community are the guiding forces leading GEEC 
into the next era of global waste remova| and the continuous generation 
of energy.

The forecast for GEEC is crystal c|ear, and this is just the tip of the 
iceberg for this emerging wor|dwide leader where shares shou|d be added 
immediately to every portfolio. We expect a continuous flow of huge 
news announcements while shares sti|| represent an uncommon va|ue for a 
Company of this caliber. Look for the continuation of strong positive 
developments that will ignite GEEC, which earns our highest rating for 
the 
most exp|osive gains on Wa|| Street.
