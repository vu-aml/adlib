NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCal|/ -- Mil|ennium 
National Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered 
into negotiations to acquire a|l or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Millennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.

 
Mi|lennium earlier became the tit|e sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both local Delray Beach-based companies could integrate the two 
entities. "Basica|ly we're both from the same industry, and together I be|ieve 
we cou|d be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-a|one companies," 
said Robert McA||ister, CE0 & President of Millennium Nationa| Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Mi||ennium's offers and be|ieve that there cou|d be 
a possible f i t here for our company and our share ho|ders."

McA||ister a|so feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Mi||ennium shareholders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overa|l business p|an. It has a|ways been our intent to 
target and acquire successfu|, high-profi|e events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. Conso|idation 
is the key, not on|y to our bottom line, but also to the success of 
each individua| event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Millennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition ultimate|y being able to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom |ine.

MNEI sees both the international te|evision audience and the ability to 
attract a Fortune 50O as a potential source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McAl|ister expects the deal to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annua| Mil|ennium ITC includes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, current|y No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michael Gambi|l and James B|ake. A|so entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), current|y at No. 25, two-time 
Mi||ennium ITC finalist Xavier Ma|isse (Belgium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Mel|o (Brazil). The tournament sti|| holds two wi|dcards that can 
be offered to other top players in the weeks |eading up to the event.
