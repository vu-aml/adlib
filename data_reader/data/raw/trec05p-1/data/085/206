You're right about the secondary market.  The Commission imposes a 120%
limit on everyone.  The problem is, this is unenforceable.  Marketers will
just bundle transportation with commodity and inflate the commodity price to
extract the transportation premium.  This happened a few ago on the
interstates when FERC tried the same thing.
