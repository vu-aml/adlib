FROM MR. JAMES OPOKU

TEL: +233 208216645 

Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not 
a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. This letter must come 
to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people 
meet and become great friends and business partners. 
My name is Mr. James Opoku, the present branch Manager of a bank here 
in Ghana. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can 
trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. Like I 
said, I have a transaction that will benefit both of us, as your 
assistance is required as a foreigner. I use to head the Accounts 
department in my bank head office, but last December I was asked to 
take position of a Manager of our branch in Kumasi who passed on, so 
that was how I became the present Manager and discovered a fortune. As 
I resumed duty, I discovered an account with total sum of $12,500,000 
million that has not been operated on for the past 4 years. From my 
investigation, I found out that this account belongs to one Late Mr. 
Morris Thompson an American great industrialist and a resident of 
Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska 
Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his 
wife and only daughter. 
You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I 
got during my investigation; 
<http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/> 
and //www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html 
The account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank 
and no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning 
it, the account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a close 
monitoring of the account since then and nobody has come forward to ask 
about the money as next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, meaning 
that no one is aware of the account. 

I cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner 
and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the 
funds and share it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have 
the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that 
comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct 
information concerning the account, which I shall give you. 
I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the 
account, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you. 
There is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed 
under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of 
law. 
If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to 
share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. 
Contact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work 
together, so we can go over the details. 

Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. 

Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I wait your urgent response. 

You can as well contact me by phone the number is +233208216645. 
Regards, 

Mr. James Opoku.
