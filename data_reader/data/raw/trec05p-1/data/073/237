As part of the TW Negotiated Rate Settlement Hearing, it has been suggested that the following modification to CAS and other associated systems be made:

EBB sytem that allows a shipper interested in capacity to simply enter a receipt and delivery point; the system will automatically let the interested shipper know how much, if any, capacity is available (advantage: although it doesn't provide the IS's the "last look" auction their looking for, it at least provides an open process for anybody that is interested to find out if capacity is available (eliminates any claim of "tortious process"); disadvantage: feasibility and cost are unknown at this time).

This was drafted by an attorney without considerable consultation with Gas Logistics.  

A settlement offer that includes minor tariff changes will be provided to the parties in the proceeding this week.  Although this will buy some time, a scope and cost estimate needs to be determined so that if the modification above is offered, we know what the cost is.    

Alma:  Please schedule a 1 hour meeting with anyone on the distribution and if anyone else should be included, please let Alma know.
