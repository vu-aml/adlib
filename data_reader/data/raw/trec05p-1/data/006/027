ATTENTION:
I am MR razak IBRAHIM, Bank Manager  Orient Bank Nig Plc,Victoria 
Island
Branch,Lagos,  Nigeria. I have an urgent and confidential business 
proposal
for you.

PROPOSAL:
On November 6, 1999, a Foreign oil merchant/Contractor with the 
NIGERIAN
NATIONAL PETROLEUM COPORATION, MR KEN POWER, made a numbered 
time(Fixed)
Deposit for twelve (12) calendar months,valued at US$28,000,000.00 
(Twenty-Eight
Million Dollars)in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine 
notification
to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a
reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,THE 
NIGERIAN
NATIONAL
PETROLEUM COPORATION that MR KEN POWER died from an automobile 
accident.On
further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL 
and
all attempts to trace his NEXT OF KIN was friutless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that MR KEN POWER
did not declare any KIN OR RELATIONS IN ALL HIS OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS, 
INCLUDING
HIS BANK DEPOSIT PAPER WORK IN MY BANK. This sum of US$28,000,000.00 is
still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the
principal sum at the end of each year. NO PERSON WILL EVER COME FOWARD 
TO
CLAIM IT.According to NIGERIAN LAW, at the expiration of 5(FIVE) YEARS,
the money will revert to the ownership of the NIGERIAN FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT
IF NOBODY APPLIES TO CLAIM THE FUND.Consequently, my proposal is that I
WANT YOU TO STAND IN AS THE NEXT OF KIN/BENEFICIARY OF THIS FUND. So 
that
the fruits of this old man?s labour will not get into the hands of some
corrupt government officials.What we are going to do is simple.You have
to provide the following
information.

We shall use these information to prepare DOCUMENTS AND 
AFFIDAVITS,THROUGH
AN ACCREDITED ATTORNEY REPRESENTING YOU AS THE NEXT OF KIN/BENEFICIARY 
OF
THIS FUND DEPOSIT.We shall need the services of the Attorney for the 
DRAFTING
AND NOTARISATION OF THE WILL,AND FOR OBTAINING ALL NECESSARY DOCUMENTS 
AND
LETTER OF PROBATE/ADMINISTRATION IN YOUR FAVOUR FOR THE TRANSFER OF THE
FUND into an account you will provide.For your assistance, you will be 
adequately
compensated with 40%) of
the total sum. (55%) will be my own share while (5%) will be set aside 
to
cover any incidental expenses made both at home and abroad before 
conclusion
of this deal.This transaction is 100% risk free as the paper work will 
be
done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees 
the
successful execution.
