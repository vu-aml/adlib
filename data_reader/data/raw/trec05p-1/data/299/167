Let me start by introducing myself. I am DR.Yong Ling Director of Operations 
of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branch.I have an obscured business 
suggestion for you.

Before the U.S and Iraqi war, our client Major Fadi Basem who was with the 
Iraqi forces and also a business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 
calendar months, with a value "DEPOSIT" only in my branch.Upon maturity 
several notice was sent to him, even during the war two years 
ago(2003).Again after the war another notification was sent and still no 
response came from him. We later found out that the Major and his family had 
been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.

After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem did 
not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work 
of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my 
office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.So,fund is still 
lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it.What bothers 
me most is that according to  the laws of my country at the expiration four 
years six months the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong 
Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.

Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a 
foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that you will 
be able to receive his funds.

Please,if you are capable of standing as the next of Kin to Major Fadi 
Basem,you should indicate so that i will give you more information.

Absolute confidentiality is required from you.Besides,I will use my 
connection to get some documents to back up the fund so that the fund can 
not be question by any authourity.

More information await you in my next response to your email message.

Please,reply me on my confidential email(yongling@katamail.com)for more 
information.

Treat as very urgent.

Yours Faithfully,

Dr.Yong Ling.
