I got a call from Questar's Jodi Starling this morning.  She said an original document is missig from the data room and was wondering if someone brought it home by mistake.

The missing information is the Dandby section from the Asset Binder.  It had a grey card-stock cover.  We can certainly keep a copy but they need the original back.  With all of the paper floating around the tables, it is likely to have been mixed up with some copies that were given to us.  Anyway, please check your stuff and see if this got in there.

Also, the late copies she was making for us (including the stuff from Colleen) will be mailed overnight to Kim on Friday.  We'll get the information passed out when we get it.

Thanks,

Mark
