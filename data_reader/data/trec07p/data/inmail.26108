Could certainly work it the same way.

Well, the question is, what does a subprocess get for fd(2) after
you do that?  I'd prefer to keep $*ERR nailed to fd(2) in general so
that modifying $*ERR actually changes the stderr of new subprocesses.
But that doesn't give you a method of indirection inside the current
process, so $*DEFERR would be a way to do that.  Forcing people
to use an explicit handle in that case would be another approach,
but certainly something like $*DEFERR would be kinder to embedding
systems that want to intercept such messages and log them.
