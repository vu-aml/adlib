Have you been in contact with or retained bankruptcy counsel? (Haedicke)

Have you been contacted about a takeover - Royal Dutch, GE?

Have you retained Goldman Sachs to advise you on credit rating, financing issues or to find a strategic partner?  Will they receive an equity stake to help Enron get out of its current situation?  (Bowen)
