Good afternoon.

I wanted to forward you one of the many emails from Cougars@Enron as well as a response from an employee.  We now have 900 documented alums here at Enron and it's growing weekly due to 1) recruiting efforts and 2) word of mouth to those who do not have UH listed in ExpertFinder.

This information should be helpful to you in recruiting efforts and any potential Enron/UH alliances.  I will include you on any Cougars@Enron notices that I think you would be interested in knowing about.

Regards,
Tracey Kozadinos

"This is too cool. I just joined the company about three months ago. I am very impressed with the level of activities for Cougars within the company. I plan to attend more functions."
