Can we locate a copy of a nexisting executing agreement for ECT or ENA.  CSFB has no record of any modified agreement.  If we could locate and fax over they will use the prior execute.

Alternatively could we continue the process of marking up the agreement they emailed.

It turns out there is one other unsettled trade that they may not be able to push through if we cannot move this through quickly.

Thanks,

Tom

just found it.  thanks

I leaned on CSFB by the way.  They are going to settle the trades outstanding, but will cut us off from further trades until we have an executed agreement.  They are locating the existing agreements to copy them.  Thanks for all your help and patience.

You should have received a fax from me by now.  Have you not received it?

Not a problem at all.  I guess I will wait for your group to produce a list.

Thanks,

Tom:

You can only see the master agreement database.  The brokerage agreement database is separate and cannot be viewed by anyone outside Legal.  The Bear Stearns agreement you see listed is there in error.  It should be in the brokerage agreement database.  We do have listings for Morgan and Goldman.  Sara wasn't aware that you couldn't see this database when you spoke,

I have gone through the database and have only been able to find the Bear Prime Broker agreement under ECI.  I know I have a Morgan ECI account and should have a Goldman pending.  I am looking for Enron Co=Enron Credit Inc. is that not correct?

Please advise.

Thanks,

Tom
