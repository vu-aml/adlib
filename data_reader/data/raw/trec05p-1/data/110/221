I'm not sure I want to give this guy this info, but if I were, what would you recommend I tell him? I think he's putting together some sort of on-line electricity buyers guide for different deregulated markets.

Elliot,

From the Enron perspective, what are some of hottest direct access markets
where companies might be able to find a savings by buying electricity right
now?

Thanks,

Mark
