About the Company

YOUTH AND AMATEUR SPORTS COMPANY POISED FOR GROWTH 

Intelligent Sports, Inc. is a publicly held company trading on the OTC markets under the ticker symbol IGTS. Intelligent Sports will be the holding company for several sports related businesses. Intelligent Sports provides business units with strategic guidance and support in the areas of marketing, sales, sponsorships, partnerships, policy & procedures, finance and expansion. Their initial business launch is to develop youth and amateur sports centers throughout the country that offers a year-round sports calendar with emphasis on youth and amateur sports programs and skill development. Their plan is to expand this concept into membership-based, multi-purpose sports facilities that will promote a diverse range of sports programs, leagues, tournaments, clinics, individual sports skill development and nutritional training.

YOUTH AND AMATEUR SPORTS INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

Organized youth sports is a growing industry. Over 20 million boys and girls participate in organized youth sports in the United States. Gone are the days of backyard, pick-up sports. These days, kids from five to eighteen are being organized into school and parent-sponsored sports programs requiring intense preparation and better competition. These demands have caused an incredible increase in cost and shortage of training, equipment and facilities for organized youth sports. Additionally, parents today are investing in their children and looking for youth sports organizations that are supportive, motivational and provide a constructive environment for participating and learning. These concerns and values create a competitive advantage for Intelligent Sports, Inc. Our youth and amateur programs will provide an ongoing and long-term relationship with our parents and youth supported with years of professional experience and personal integrity. Intelligent Sports will provide recreational, developmental and competitive programs for youth sports that will be fun, bring families together and teach children life lessons about teamwork, setting goals and the value of hard work.
