We had agreed to get together on Tuesday to finish our discussion on the TNPC wanrrants and the unwind of the Raptor structure.  I am suggesting that we get together on Tuesday morning at 8:00.  Please let me know if that works for everyone.

Outstanding issues:
	How will the FAS 125/140 transactions related to the warrants unwind on EES?  Have they been unwound as part of the September writedown?

	Do the deferred taxes on Raptor after the September entries relate to the basis in the warrants transferred out of Raptor (73 million)?  Where did this amount get transferred?

	What are the deferred taxes that remain on the books of the Raptor entities after September, 2001?

Any other topics?

Anne - can you reserve EB1701 at 8:00 on Tuesday morning for us?

Thanks,

Patty
