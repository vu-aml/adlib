Mike,
I've been working on your variable rate sheet you sent the other day.  I'm working with the IT guys to get that made into a web page so that it can be put onto the plasma screens.  We discussed the pros and cons today of using EOL Listen as opposed to Reuters and it appears that EOL Listen is the best way to go because IT is trying to keep the plasma screens in the new building limited to just web material.  I'll be getting that out as quickly as the IT guys can get it done.  I just talked to Matt Smith and he is going to come by and explain in better detail the Keystone page.  I'll take a look at this sheet you sent me, I'll find a way to get it automated and keep you up to date.

Thank you,

Aaron

Just want to check on the variable rate spreadsheet that you are working on.  Also, can you please change the Keystone page in the west packet to show total supply in the Permian basin with all delivery points to exporting pipelines (EPNG, Northern, Valero, TW).  Right now it just shows receipts into EPNG.

Please look at the att [Berutti, Aaron] ached spreadsheet.  It is a manual sheet that shows total EOL trades by trader.  Can we automate this sheet so that we can monitor by day?

Please respond when you get a chance.  Let me know if this is unclear.

Thanks,
Mike
