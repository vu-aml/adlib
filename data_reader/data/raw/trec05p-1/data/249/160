_______________
The Company:
_______________

Industry Sectors -- Mining, Ore Processing and Refining

Industry Applications -- Ore processing and extraction of precious, strategic, and rare earth metals and other minerals

Technology Invented -- 2001
Current Operating Status -- Proof of Concept Unit Complete Oretech, Inc. has developed a proof of concept model that represents a breakthrough in ore processing technology. The process utilizes a proprietary high temperature technique to extract various metals from ore bodies that are typically highly carbonaceous.

The proof of concept model has extracted gold and silver from various samples of carbonaceous ore bodies. 

With only a few equipment enhancements future Oretech production units should be able to extract many additional metallic elements including platinum, rhodium and scandium. OreTech, Inc's business model is to become a major producer of gold and other precious metals through the use of its proprietary technology. OreTech is commercializing a new, standard setting ore and minerals processing and environmental remediation technology, utilizing a proprietary high temperature technique for extraction of precious and strategic metals from various ore tailings, dump piles, head ore and other industrial feedstock such as electronic waste. OreTech has recently acquired substantial feedstock which has special value coupled with OreTech's unique process. Overall, management has been encouraged by the initial results and reiterates its technology will favorably address certain issues associated with the mining industry:


No need for hazardous cyanide heap leaching. 
Minimal power requirements. 
Acceptable recovery rates from dump and tailings feedstock. 
This technology represents a major innovation in the industry. 
With this in mind, the Company's objectives over the next year include: 

Continued validation of the Company's technology on several different sources of feedstock.
Further study on optimal scalability.
Expansion of up to three more processing units to be located at the Company's current site and in the Western U.S. 

Management maintains, meeting these objectives could allow the Company to achieve processing rates of up to 1000-1250 tons of raw feedstock per week within the next twelve months.
