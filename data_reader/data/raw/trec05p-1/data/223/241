In order to point to the UBS environment in EnPower you need to change your PortCalc Host to the following.  This screen is reached through Tools - Option Environment.  Also, copy the PortCalc Host into your FTP Host:

 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 

Let me know if you have any questions.
