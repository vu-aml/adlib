	Invitations to the NFL playoff party weren't mailed out until the final game, but now 12 teams are focused on winning a championship. Who could have predicted the surprising run to the playoffs by New England, Pittsburgh and Chicago? If you're saying "I could have," then consider this your invitation to:

It has been said that defense wins championships, and looking at the teams that had the best defensive numbers (right), the stats don't lie. So now it's up to you:

The choice is up to you when you play ESPN.com's
