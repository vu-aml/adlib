THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE HAS ISSUED A FLOOD WARNING FOR THE KENAI
RIVER, INCLUDING THE AREAS OF KENAI LAKE, COOPER LANDING, AND KENAI

HEAVY RAIN OVER THE UPPER PORTION OF THE KENAI BASIN ON MONDAY NIGHT

LAWING HAS RISEN 3.4 FT IN THE PAST 30 HOURS AND THE SNOW RIVER ROSE
4.0 FEET BEFORE CRESTING TUESDAY AFTERNOON. ADDITIONAL PRECIPITATION
OF UP TO 1.5 INCHES IS EXPECTED AND WILL PROLONG THE CREST.  WATER

THE MAIN AREA AFFECTED BY STAGES BELOW 14 FT.  THE SNOW GLACIER LAKE
HAS NOT RELEASED AT THIS TIME.

MINOR FLOODING IS ALSO POSSIBLE AT KENAI KEYS. STAGES ARE EXPECTED TO
CREST LATE FRIDAY DOWNSTREAM OF KENAI KEYS AT ABOUT 13 FEET ON THE
USGS GAGE AND AT ABOUT 12 FEET AT KENAI KEYS. 

THE HEAVIEST RAINS OVER THE KENAI PENINSULA HAVE ENDED, WITH LIGHTER
AMOUNTS OF RAIN FORECAST FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY.  SMALLER STREAMS
