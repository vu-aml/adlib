Elliot,

Sorry that it has taken me so long to respond but we just migrated to "Outlook", which should be named "Outhouse" but nevertheless the states where EESI currently delivers physical power are:

Pennsylvania
Ohio
Maine
Massachusetts
Rhode Island
California
Texas
New York
New Hampshire

We are also looking at delivery capability in the near future within the following states:

Illinois
New Jersey
Maryland

Important to keep in mind that the physical delivery of electricity in all of the above cases may be limited to certain products and certain utilitity territories.

Regards,

Richard

How many states are we actively offering direct access? I'd like this info for the Green Power group.
