NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Kevin Dyson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=12342&>, WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 12/07/01
Look for Dyson to play well this week. He has overcome a nagging toe injury and should take advantage of a shaky Vikings defense. 

Frank Wycheck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 12/07/01
Wycheck, still suffering from a lingering ankle injury is expected to play in Sunday's game. However, he is listed as questionable. Don't expect him to be too productive. 

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/e! li! nk?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 12/07/01
George is expected to play in Sunday's game against Minnesota. He aggravated an ankle injury last Sunday and is listed as questionable for this week's game. 

Kordell Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1054&>, QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Stewart has been an efficient passers and runner in recent weeks. Get him in your lineup if you need a QB. He seems to have established himself as a decent option for Fantasy owners. 

Elvis Joseph <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=236843&> , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Joseph is suffering from a shoulder injury but is expected to play Sunday. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Frank Updated 12/07/01
Smith has been one of the most consistent receivers this season. Don't hesitate to get him in your active lineup every week. 

Tim Couch <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=133260&>, QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Couch was pulled from Sunday's game but that was only because he was a little banged up. He shoul! d ! be a solid Fantasy starter this week. 

Benjamin Gay <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=245054&>, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Gay is a risky start for this week. He will likely split carries with James Jackson. 

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Frank Updated 12/07/01
Dillon should remain in your active lineup week in and week out in any league. He has struggled at times this season but is still on of the better runners in the NFL. 

Jo! n ! Kitna <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1847&> , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despite his recent struggles. However, Kitna is not worth using in Fantasy leagues right now. 

Brad Louis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=187657&>, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Louis has been diagnosed with a torn groin muscle and will be sidelined for the rest of the season. He hurt himself on Wednesday and an MRI on Thursday revealed a tear. St. Louis was expected to be a backup tight end and long snapper. His injury won't have much of an impact other than to weaken the Bengals' depth at tight end. Kirk McMullen will be the No. 1. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=! bi! ge01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Mcnair was limited in practice Thursday but The Tennessean reports that he plans to play Sunday. McNair has spent most of the week recovering from an arm injury. "Right now the big thing is handing off," McNair told the paper. "It's the motion, when you follow through on it, I just have to watch that. I feel fine throwing the ball." Keep him in your lineup this week unless you have a backup of equal value. 

Danny Farmer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=187533&>, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Farmer is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. He is suffering from a sprained ankle. Farmer won't be too productive if he do! es! play. 

Kyle Brady <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1356&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Brady, according to published reports, practiced Friday and will play Sunday. He is still recovering from an ankle injury. 

Mark Brunell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 12/07/01
Brunell, according to published reports, practiced on Friday and will play Sunday. He is still recovering from a quadriceps injury. 

Jammi German <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=12390&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
The Cleveland Browns placed German on injured reserve Thursday. German missed the last two games with a knee injury. He had seven catches for 65 yards in six games this season. 

James Allen <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1820&>, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Allen has been a solid replacement for Anthony Thomas over the past two weeks. However, it looks as though Thomas will be back for Week 13 against Green Bay, which means that Allen will see a serious decrease in playing time. Unless Thomas has a setback, be sure to reserve Allen. 

Jim Miller <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1053&> , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Miller has been inconsistent this season, which was evident in his Week 12 performance (124 yards passing, no TDs, one INT) against Detroit. With the Fantasy playoffs looming, start Miller is a huge gamble. 

Dez White <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
White had a few decent weeks, but he's been unreliable lately. He's too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy season, so avoid using White at all costs. 

Anthony Thomas <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 12/07/01
According to the Chicago Sun Times, Thomas will likely start on Sunday vs. Green Bay. "Last week I was about 95 percent," Thomas said. "When I'd go into my full stride, I'd feel a little twinge But now when I go into my full stride, I don't feel any pain." Head Coach Dick Jauron will make the final call on Thomas once the medical staff clears him to play. Barring any setbacks, starting Thomas on your Fantasy team seems like a safe play. 

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Banks is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Arizona due to an ankle injury. He is expected to start, but he's too risky to warrant a major role on your Fantasy team at this point in the season. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He faces a decent matchup against Arizona in Week 13, however, so starting him in a deeper league is worth considering. 

Rod Gardner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Despite catching a touchdown last week against Dallas, Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable. 

Mike Alstott <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&! le! ague=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1169&>, RB TB - JWillie Updated 12/07/01
Alstott may get a few goal-line carries against Detroit, but his yardage numbers have been subpar for the most part. Unless you play in a touchdown league, playing Alstott is somewhat risky. 

Brad Johnson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1039&>, QB TB - Matty Updated 12/07/01
Johnson has been a real disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. He's been held without a touchdown pass for three straight games, and has been picked off three times over that span. He faces a good matchup vs. Detroit, but using Johnson should be a last resort. 

Jacquez Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=12405&>, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Green put up decent numbers in Week 12, but he's still far too unreliable to consider starting on your Fantasy team. Avoid using him if at all possible. 

Torry Holt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=133310&>, WR STL - Tori Updated 12/07/01
Holt is a must-start this week against San Francisco. This NFC West contest has the potential to be a high-scoring affair, which makes Holt a good play on your Fantasy team. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key! =1! 294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 12/07/01
Bruce may not be having his best statistical season, but he's still worth starting on a weekly basis. He has three straight eight-catch, 100-plus yard receiving games against San Francisco, which makes him a must-start in Week 13. 

Ernie Conwell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1366&>, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Conwell is becoming increasingly unreliable as a Fantasy player. If you have a better tight end on your roster, you may want to consider benching him in Week 13 vs. San Francisco. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1292&> , WR SF - Matty Updated 12/07/01
Stokes has been unreliable for the most part, but has strung together a few good outings in recent weeks. With the possibility of a high-scoring game against St. Louis in Week 13, Stokes is worth considering in deeper Fantasy leagues.
