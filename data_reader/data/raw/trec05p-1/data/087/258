Right now in ZP26 there is very little demand and a lot of generation. Bob is expecting the demand to increase in 2002 for that area and generation will move along with it. His thinking is that prices will drop. The further you go out in time, he doesn't expect generation to keep as the demand continues to grow and so he is forecasting an increase in prices from around late 2005 out.

FYI, there are more changes coming to the reports. Tim was in Houston last week and John said he thinks the reports could be changed or improved. Tim wants to see certain changes and get rid of some reports that John had told you he wanted to see when we made the changes about a month ago. I told Tim that I am not doing anything until he talks to John about it and they both agree. I hate to say it but it is becoming somewhat comical these reports. So just a heads up that some changes we make may come back to the East as well.

Below are two pictures that may create a questions, the most obvious being why is calendar ZP26 bonkers?  Does it really deserve that backwardation? Any feedback would be great..

Thanks,
Frank
