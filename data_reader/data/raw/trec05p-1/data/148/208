NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Keenan McCardell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1235&>, WR JAC - Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01
McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.

Stacey Mack <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/25/01
Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk beca! us! e of his inconsistency. 

Qadry Ismail <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1514&>, WR BAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01
The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.

Jason Brookins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/25/01
Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.

Ron Dayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01
Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.

Tiki Barber <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01
Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&ra! nd! om=734&key=235249&>, RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/25/01
Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss. 

Doug Flutie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 11/25/01
Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage. 

Jake Plummer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best. 

David Boston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01
Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Willie Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1234&>, WR NO - Martin Updated 11/25/01
Jackson had a ! go! od outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues. 

Joe Horn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 11/25/01
Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/25/01
In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.

Antowain Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/25/01
Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers

Tom Brady <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=187741&>, QB NE - Martin Updated 11/25/01
Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week.

Rich Gannon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/25/01
Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.

Frank Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.

Eric Moulds <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1196&>, WR BUF - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01
Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.

Alex Van Pelt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1011&>, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 11/25/01
Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.

Jay Fiedler <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=12363&>, QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/25/01
Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.

Donovan McNabb <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 11/25/01
The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.

James Thrash <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 11/25/01
Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too in! co! nsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach. 

Rod Gardner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch. 

Ki-Jana Carter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1089&>, RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.

Isaac Byrd <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1762&>, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/25/01
Muhammad missed S! un! day's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next weekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time. 

Derrick Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/01
Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.

Chris Chandler <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy numbers. 

Derrick Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/01
Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.
