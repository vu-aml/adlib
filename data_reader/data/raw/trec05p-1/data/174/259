Terrie/Cindy,

Once you all finalize the general letter, it would probably be an appropriate response here.  it won't make her feel any better, but it will at least acknowledge that we received her complaint

    RE: PLANETFEEDBACK REFERENCE NUMBER 1177072

Dear Mr. Skilling,

I'd like to bring your attention to a complaint I have with your company's overall experience. I know you appreciate your customers and want to keep them happy, so I am certain you'll want to address this quickly. This incident has infuriated me.

Here's the problem: How DARE you treat your former employees the way you have in the last three weeks!!!  To throw employees who have devoted their lives to make your company great out on the street with no severance and trying to get out of the WARN act is a disgrace.

We were told to wait out the bankrupty, and you would be petitioning the court for a severence in addition to the measly $4500 we received.  It's been like pulling teeth to get information about our termination date, unemployment, insurance, and all of our unanswered questions.  And to top it all off, you gave YOURSELVES $58 million dollars in BONUSES!  Meanwhile, there are former employees out there that have lost their entire retirement, kids who aren't getting a Christmas this year, and families having to sell their homes.  How do you sleep at night?!?!?!

My situation isn't as bad as some, but I got screwed nonetheless.  With only a year of experience, all at Enron, I'm having an EXTREMELY hard time competing with the talented Enron exes.  I have a wedding in six months, student loans, a car note, credit card debt, and I was FOUR DAYS AWAY from closing on a new house that I can't get anymore because I don't have a job.  Frivilous, maybe, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do now with no benefits and desperately trying to fight depression, which doesn't make this any easier.

I hope the bankruptcy court

Here's what I'd like to see happen: Just pay all the employees you've laid off since November the severance you kept telling us we would get.  That and any outstanding monies that the $4500 didn't cover (this includes payment for our unused vacation time!!!).

We will NOT let you get away with this.

My overall experiences with your company have been extremely negative. This incident has discouraged me. I definitely won't recommend you to any of my family or friends.

Again, I am sure you are interested in satisfying your customers, so I hope you'll move quickly on this complaint. Thanks.

Sincerely,
Meredith Stewart
