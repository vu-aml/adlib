Hey nan- Did you happen to notice this little blurb.......how is it that people who were there hardly any length of time and weren't making much to begin with should be given more consideration than us? A lot of people would have only had a couple months on the typical plan. And if they think people who were making more money are in less hardship, they obviously have never seen the bills our friends have.

18. The Former Employees recognize that the hardships faced by the laid-off workers are greatest at lower end of the income spectrum and not as overwhelming higher up.  Accordingly, they propose that the full severance payments (including any $4500 payments) be limited to $30,000 per employee.
