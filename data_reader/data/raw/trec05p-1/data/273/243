Dear Sir/Madam

Naturally , this letter will come to you as a
surprise, since we have not met, permit me however,  
I am MR.TONIY   AHMED manager with ORIENT BANK NIG
PLC, in collaboration with my colleague in the bank,
we are contacting you and soliciting for your
assistance based on this proposition below, which will
be of mutual benefit to both parties.

PROPOSITION:

A Salvadorean, Mr. Ramirez Sanchez, 66 years of age
and a very prosperous farmer and a business man made a
huge bank deposit for investment in the sum of
US$10,500,000.= (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand US
Dollars), he named his wife Mrs. Helga Sanchez as the
NEXT OF KIN.

Unfortunately, Mr.& Mrs. Ramirez Sanchez were killed
in the January 14, earthquake that rocked El
Salvador,killing thousands of people and 1,200 others
were declared missing.

The management of bank has made several efforts
through the El Salvadorean High Commission in Lagos to
contact any of the deceased family relatives, but to
no avail.

since the bank management was unable to reach any of
the deceased family relatives,the option left for the
Bank Management is to declare the deceased account
dormant and revert the funds on trading and investment
in the interest of the Bank. the bank system stipulate
that if such money remain with the bank for priod
of 5years it will be tranfere into the account of the
bank

In order to avoid this development, since it has so
far been impossible to trace any of the deceased
family relatives,my colleaque  and i  now seek your
personal permission and assistance to have you stand
as a distant relativ to the deceased so that the fund
will be released to you and we can use it for our
mutual benefit. I hope you do understand my concern in
this matter,if you are willing to assit us.

For your assistance, you will be compensated
adequately with (30%) of the total sum, (65%) will
be our share, while (5%) will be set aside to cover
any incidental expense made both at home and abroad
prior to this transaction.

If you are interested in assisting us with this
matter, please, send to me urgently via my email the
following details below:

1. Your full name and complete contact address
2. Your Private telephone and fax number (urgent)

details from you, we will work out every
document/proof representing you as the deceased
BONA-FIDE distant relative and when this is done, you
will be contacted by the bank for the release and
collection of the fund, 

which will be within two week of our receiving the
above details from you. We will meet with you in your
country after the fund have been released to you and
also to discuss investments potentials and have our

in my country.

modalities to enable a hitch-free transaction.
