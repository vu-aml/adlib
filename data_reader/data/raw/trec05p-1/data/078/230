These numbers are based on the current regulation (i.e. prior to the Board's
January changes, which are not yet final) and are not adjusted to reflect
those changes.  Most of the credits referenced in these numbers, however,
were earned prior to 2001 and therefore will not change.  The Board's
changes will be retroactive to MY 2001 placements but not for earlier
placements.
