UC BERKELEY AND THE HAAS SCHOOL RESPOND TO THE NATIONAL TRAGEDY
Nearly a week after the terrorist attacks on America, the Haas School 
community has expressed its sadness, shock, and concern in a series of 
events on campus with more to follow.

As of Monday, the Haas School was waiting for definitive word on whether or 
not any Haas alumni or students were missing or confirmed dead in these 
attacks.  The Haas NewsWire will report on any losses when official 
confirmation is available. In addition, alumni and students have been using 
the Haas e-mail mailing lists to account for alumni in New York City and 
Washington DC.

Dean Tyson has opened two previously scheduled MBA student lunches to the 
entire Haas community so that everyone can join her to discuss how last 
week's tragedy has touched their lives and the Haas School community. The 
first lunch will be on Tuesday, September 18, and the second on Wednesday, 
September 19. Both lunches will be held at 12:45 in the Haas courtyard.

Tyson was stranded for most of last week in New York City, where she had 
traveled on school business. In her absence, Ben Hermalin, associate dean 
of academic affairs, called for an informal gathering for faculty, 
students, and staff to provide a forum for discussion and support on the 
day of the attacks. In addition, some classes and events were canceled that 
day, and students, faculty, and staff gathered in the Bank of America Forum 
to watch the news unfold on television and to discuss the implications of 
these sad events.

On the central campus, Chancellor Robert Berdahl called for a moment of 
silence on Friday, September 14, at noon as the campanile bells tolled, 
marking the national day of mourning. On September 17, a well-attended 
campus-wide memorial service for the victims of the attacks was held on 
Memorial Glade.

In the coming days, the information below regarding blood drives, 
contributions, and activities may be of help.

+  According to central campus, there are no more appointments available at 
the on-campus blood drives scheduled for this week. The local chapter of 
the American Red Cross also reports their supplies are at capacity but they 
emphasize that the need for blood will be ongoing. At this time they are 
asking that you wait until next Friday, September 21, to register to give 
blood. Normally they take walk-ins at the donation center at 6230 Claremont 
Ave., but under the current circumstances they ask that you register in 
advance by phoning: 1-800-GIVE LIFE.

+  The Berkeley campus has created this site, 
http://www.berkeley.edu/news/specupdates/index.html, for updates on events 
and building closures on campus.

+  Last Friday evening, the MBA students put together an impromptu 
fundraising barbecue for the Red Cross, which raised just over $2,300.  If 
you missed the opportunity to give on Friday, visit the Red Cross site at 
http://www.redcross.org/.

+  The site at http://www.finebrand.com/statuses, which the Haas School 
recommended as a resource to find missing friends in the Haas community, 
has been shut down. The federal government site, 
http://www.firstgov.gov/featured/usgresponse.html, has links to many 
survivor registries.  A group of Berkeley students also created a site with 
links to many of the sites for survivor registries, donations, and of 
companies affected by the attack: http://safe.millennium.berkeley.edu/.
