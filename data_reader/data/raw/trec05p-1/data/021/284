 Sorry we could not meet.  The problem seems to be Mary lists the total in R 112386 as $114,109.41 while in SAP the total is $64,720.92.  Please see attached.  I don't see how Mary's report could possibly tie to SAP.  Please provide me an SAP report that details $114,109.41 in R112386 because the one I run keeps coming up with $64,720.92.

	Dan,
	Are you available to meet with Tracy and me tomorrow, August 7, for about 30 minutes between 11:30 and 2, in Tracy's office?  Let me know.  We can compare reports and see where we are not connecting.
	Mary
