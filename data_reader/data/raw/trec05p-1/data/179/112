Latest NFL Player News

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/27/01
McNair missed practice Wednesday because of back pain. "I'm going to try to
do some things tomorrow and hope it loosens up and not have as much pain as
I had today," McNair said. "I'm not going to go out and try to force the
issue. If it's still sore and still tight where I can't have all my
mechanics right, I'm not going to force the issue." The Titans listed him
as questionable yet again Wednesday, but McNair likely will play 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 12/27/01
Bettis is still listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the
Cincinnati Bengals after missing Pittsburgh's last three games with a groin
injury. He skipped Wednesday's practice, as he has done most of the season,
even when healthy. "I can't really predict the future, so I take it day by
day," Bettis said. "I'm not 100 percent yet. I just want to keep improving
and take it day by day." 

Martin Gramatica, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Gramatica sat out practice Wednesday, but is expected to test his injured
leg on Thursday. Doug Brien and Brad Daluiso worked out Wednesday for the
Buccaneers, who might sign one if Martin Gramatica can't kick against the
Baltimore Ravens this week. 

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/26/01
Trent Dilfer will start this week in place of Hasselbeck, whose separated
left shoulder is too sore for him to play. Coach Mike Holmgren said
Wednesday that Hasselbeck aggravated the injury, which he's had since the
third week of the season, against the New York Giants last Sunday. "There's
a chance I might have him and he could play in an emergency-type situation,
but he's pretty sore," Holmgren said. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 12/26/01
Stewart is day to day with a sprained ankle. His status for this week's
game is unclear. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 12/26/01
Graham may miss his second consecutive game this week because of the death
of his father. With Tim Dwight (lung) still ailing, Trevor Gaylor may have
to start again. 

Skip Hicks, RB TEN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/26/01
Hicks is expected to miss this week's game with a hamstring injury, and may
miss the rest of the season. Eddie George should assume a regular workload
once again. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 12/26/01
Smith is day to day with a hip injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 12/26/01
Warrick, who was benched late in last week's game, is expected to start. He
has been a disappointment this year and Fantasy players should not use him
at this point of the postseason. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/26/01
Bouman (thumb) may attempt to practice late in the week. His status remains
unclear for this week's game, and Spergon Wynn is available to start if
needed. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/26/01
Walls is day to day with a knee injury. He should be able to play this
week. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Muhammad is still battling a turf toe injury. His status for Week 16 is
still unclear. 

Larry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 12/26/01
Parker's season is over. He will undergo surgery on his shoulder and the
Chiefs are expected to place him on injured reserve. 

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/26/01
Gadsden (hamstring) might miss his second consecutive game this week. Chris
Chambers may start in his place again. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 12/26/01
Taylor (groin) has returned to practices and is working with the scout
team. He might appear in the team's final game, and is a longshot to play
this week. He has missed too much playing time to warrant serious Fantasy
consideration at this point of the playoffs. 

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 12/26/01
Smith (ankles) has returned to practice. He is expected to play this week. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/26/01
Ismail is recovering from a mild concussion. He is expected to play this
week. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 12/26/01
Galloway is day to day with a hip injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 12/26/01
Emanuel is day to day with an ankle injury. His status for the upcoming
week is unclear right now. 

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 12/26/01
McKnight is day to day with an ankle injury. He is expected to play this
week. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 12/26/01
Brunell is day to day with a quadriceps injury. He is expected to play this
week. 

Mike McMahon, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
McMahon may miss some practice time this week with a foot injury. His
status for this week's game is unclear right now, and Ty Detmer will start
in his place if he can't play. 

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Brookins may be able to return for Baltimore's final game. For now, Terry
Allen and Moe Williams will continue to split carries. 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 12/25/01
Bettis is listed as questionable for Week 16. However, he may be able to
return to the Steelers' starting lineup. Bill Cowher said Bettis is
progressing, and he will be used this week if healthy. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 12/23/01
Stewart suffered a sprained ankle early in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. He
was replaced by Lamont Warren in the first quarter, and Stewart did not
return. 

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Luccis Losers Updated 12/23/01
Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He is not expected to play
again this season. 

Ahman Green, RB GB - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with labored breathing. He
was replaced by Dorsey Levens. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/23/01
Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the
first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/23/01
Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he
left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee. 

Martin Gramatica, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Gramatica injured his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. The
Buccaneers may sign a free agent kicker to replace him in Week 16.

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/23/01
Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to
start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 12/23/01
Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of
his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham
doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be
signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3
receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has
been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to
Fantasy glory. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/23/01
McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He
played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be
a solid No. 1 QB.

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/23/01
Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's
game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with
extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not
be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No.
1 Fantasy QB. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He
left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the
game.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a
hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.

Fred Beasley, RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of
the regular season. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a
must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't
depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in
place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help
Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the
weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you
need an emergency QB. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs.
Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player
on many title teams, and should never be benched. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best
wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him
during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be
a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper
league, starting Gardner isn't advisable. 

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too
talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead
your team to Fantasy glory.

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start
during the rest of the season. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2
wideout during your postseason.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during
the Fantasy postseason. 

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Morton has been inconsistent this season but he will still be a solid No. 2
during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup.

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement. But he is not
accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Toomer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid
Fantasy numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2
wideout during your playoffs.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the
NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not
in the playoff race. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into
your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs. 

Shawn Bryson, RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Bryson will start in place of the injured Travis Henry this week. Consider
him as a No. 2 RB if you need help at that spot. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Thrash was not very consistent during the regular season and may not catch
a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season. He will be
a No. 2 wideout at best during the Fantasy playoffs. 

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Patten's numbers have dropped off in recent weeks. Don't use him unless
your team is very thin at wide receiver. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Galloway has been a disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. Unless
you're in a deeper league, starting Galloway during your playoffs isn't
recommended. 

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Brown has been an inconsistent Fantasy receiver this year. He may not be a
reliable option during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Dunn has been inconsistent this season. He will be a No. 2 back at best
during your playoffs. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Smith is a must-start player during the Fantasy postseason. Even if his
yardage totals aren't good, he is a tremendous TD threat. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 12/21/01
Johnson has caught a lot of passes this season, but has only one TD
reception. Nevertheless, he will still be a reliable receiver in your
playoffs.

Anthony Becht, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Becht hasn't been a consistent target for the Jets this year. He may not be
very valuable during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Coles has been New York's best receiver this year. He will continue to be a
consistent TD threat during the Fantasy postseason. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Miller has been inconsistent this season. Starting Miller is too huge a
gamble in the Fantasy playoffs. 

Curtis Martin, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Martin will be a key player in many Fantasy championship drives. Keep him
in your lineup throughout the rest of the season. 

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Booker has been one of the better receivers in the NFC. Look for him to
produce solid numbers in the Fantasy postseason. 

Chris Chambers, WR MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Chambers may start this week because Oronde Gadsden will be less than 100
percent healthy with a hamstring injury. He will continue to be a regular
TD threat during the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Pittman has been inconsistent as a Fantasy player. Don't rely on him too
much during the Fantasy playoffs.

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 12/21/01
Plummer has played well this season. He should be an adequate QB during the
Fantasy playoffs. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
Williams (ribs) is now listed as probable. He has been practicing with no
apparent problems. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
According to the <i>Pro Football News and Injury Report</i>, Davis' status
for Sunday's game is questionable right now. He has told reporters he will
play, but Ki-Jana Carter will start in his place if Davis can't play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Hakim has a sore back. He is expected to play against Carolina. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Faulk has a minor knee problem. He is listed as probable for this week's
game. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
Bruce (foot) missed Thursday's practice. He is listed as probable for this
week. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Owens (hip) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this
week. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Garcia (ribs) returned to practice on Thursday. "We didn't do too much with
him but just enough to make him feel somewhat confident about making
progress this week. The important thing will be how he feels tomorrow, does
he become real sore," Steve Mariucci told the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. "I
didn't notice any wincing. I didn't see any grimacing. I saw him throw a
couple of frozen ropes." Garcia is expected to play this week. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Bouman worked on a limited basis in practice on Thursday. There is a chance
Spergon Wynn may start in his place this week, and that decision may be
made on Friday. 

Larry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Parker may miss this week's game with a shoulder injury. He has not been a
reliable Fantasy player this year when healthy. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Holmes returned to practice on Thursday. He should assume his regular
workload this week. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Franks (ankle) has returned to practice. He is expected to play on Sunday. 

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Gadsden (hamstring) has returned to practice, but Chris Chambers may start
over him this week. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Muhammad (toe) did not practice on Thursday. He might miss the game against
Buffalo, and Isaac Byrd will start in his place if Muhammad can't play. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Walls (ankle) practiced on Thursday. He might be able to play against
Buffalo. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Price (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this
week. 

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Wycheck started off slow this season but has been productive in recent
weeks. Expect him to contribute a fair amount of points during the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Christian missed practice with tightness in his calf on Thursday. His
current status is day to day. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
George is listed as questionable for Saturday's game because of an ankle
injury, but is expected to play. Look for him to be productive this week
against a weak Raider run defense. 

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Look for Dyson to be a decent No. 2 receiver during the Fantasy postseason.
He might not score, but he should catch a few passes. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Mason is expected to play Saturday, despite suffering from a hip injury.
Look for him to be an adequate No. 2 wideout. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Ward hasn't scored a lot of touchdowns this season but is among the league
leaders in receptions. He should be an asset to your team for the rest of
the season as a No. 2 wideout. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Burress has been more reliable in recent weeks but still remains a risky
pick for the Fantasy playoffs. He will only be a good No. 2 wideout at
best. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. Don't expect
him to be too productive during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Mack has produced an adequate amount of all-purpose yardage but hasn't
scored a lot. He should be used in larger leagues only for the remaining
weeks. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
McCardell has caught a lot of passes this season but he doesn't score too
many touchdowns. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 receiver in the Fantasy
playoffs.

Donald Hayes, Reserve WR Updated 12/21/01
Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in
place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help
Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.

Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs.
Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.

Marty Booker, Active WR Updated 12/21/01
Booker has been one of the better receivers in the NFC. Look for him to
produce solid numbers in the Fantasy postseason. 

Duce Staley, Active RB Updated 12/21/01

your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs. 

Ike Hilliard, Reserve WR Updated 12/20/01
The <I>New York Daily News</i> says the pain in Hilliard's toe has
worsened. He aggravated the injury in Week 14, but he is expected to play
against Seattle. 

Alex Van Pelt, Reserve QB Updated 12/16/01
The Patriots limited Van Pelt to 219 passing yards, no TDs and one
interception. Right now, the Buffalo QB is not playing well enough to start
for any Fantasy team. 

Charlie Garner, Active RB Updated 12/16/01
Garner had 113 scrimmage yards against San Diego on Saturday. He was held
out of the end zone for the third straight week, however, and has only
scored two touchdowns the entire season. 

Cris Carter, Active WR Updated 12/16/01
The Lions held Carter to 30 yards on three catches. Still, the veteran
receiver is too experienced and potentially productive to bench during any
week of the Fantasy playoffs. 

Mike Alstott, Active RB Updated 12/09/01
Alstott rushed for 66 yards and a TD and caught four passes for 34 yards
against Detroit. The Tampa Bay fullback will be a regular scoring threat
during the Fantasy postseason.

Ravens, Active DT Updated 11/20/01
Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after
undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of
the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage
than usual. 

David Akers, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a
field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this
season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their
bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.
