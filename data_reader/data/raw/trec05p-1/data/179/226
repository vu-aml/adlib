Julie,

Thanks for the email!  I do ski and sometimes even snowboard.  I prefer to ski due to the fact that I'm better at skiing, but normally take the snowboard out once or twice a year.  Do you ski or snowboard?  Judging from your profile I bet you do both.  So you say you have been in town the last 16 months, how do you like it so far?  I'm from Texas, San Antonio, and in fact just came back from visiting my family over the Christmas holiday.  What about you, have you had very many chances to get back home?  South Carolina must be nice this time of year.  I like going back to Texas in the winter; it's the summer that's too hot.

What do you have planned for New Year's.  I have a couple of friends coming into town this weekend and staying through the 1st.  We are planning to ski Vail for the weekend and then party at the downtown Hyatt for New Year's.  I hope we get a few more snowfalls before the weekend.  Vail's nice but the other resorts could use more snow!  I skied Keystone about two weeks back and they didn't have many of the runs open.  I hope that starts to change.

I noticed you live in Aurora and work in Lakewood.  I live in Broomfield and work downtown.  One of the natural gas pipelines we work with is in Lakewood.  Next time I'm in their office you'll have to let me take you to lunch.

Paul

PS  Those pictures you sent in are very good, you have GREAT legs!
