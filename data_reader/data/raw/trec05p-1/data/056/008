Louise,

I think the following is appropriate and I can get done:

Dyer:
Base - Same
Cash - $50
Equity - $150

Mcdonald:
Base - Same
Cash - $75
Equity - $200

Parquet:
Base - Same
Cash - $100
Equity - $250

I know these are at the top end.  For what it is worth, the other guys I got done this year were not at the top end because I did not believe it was necessary (Gilbert, Page, Etringer, Thome, Wehn).

If we can say done, the actual contract process can be slowed so that the equity is not set till the November meeting.  Also, if we get done, I wont bug you anymore!
