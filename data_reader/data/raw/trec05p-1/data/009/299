I talked to Rafael and he is aware that any invoices or payment requests to ECI must be approved by both Mary and Rob prior to payment.  Also I will look into the ability to  require any payments to ECI through the accounts payable system be blocked pending approval from Mary and Rob.  

If you have any questions, please call
