Hi Rosalee:

Steve Kean tells me that Mr. Lay has a call with Mayor Brown of San Francisco at 9 AM tomorrow morning.  Steve has asked me to forward to you for Mr. Lay some materials in advance of that meeting.  I'll have those ready to forward to you in about 30-45 minutes.  Will you be there to receive them and forward to Mr. Lay? 

Hope all finds you well.

Best,
Jeff
