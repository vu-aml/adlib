Natural Gas Futures Continue Downward Spiral




    Natural gas for November delivery on the NYMEX continued decline yesterday, dropping $0.036 to $2.208 after hitting a new contract low of $2.14. The December contract dipped $0.02 to $2.602 per MMBtu. Prices opened sharply lower, but managed to stage an erratic rally to finish near the highs of the day. The mild weather and diminishing storage availability continue to pressure a weak cash market which in turns is dragging down futures prices. As storage becomes less available more expensive, the differential between cash and futures could continue to widen. Early injection estimates for tomorrows weekly AGA storage report range between 75 Bcf to 85 Bcf. For the same week last year, stocks rose 78 Bcf, and on average over the last 5 years, stocks have gained about 70 Bcf. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports last week's tally of 39 Heating Degree Days was 11 above normal, but 5 less than forecast and 5 below the same week a year ago. NOAA said it expected 44 HDDs this week, or 6 above normal. In terms of cooling degree days, NOAA said last week's tally of 18 was 13 less than the previous week, 7 below normal and 2 less than the same week a year ago. NOAA has forecast 13 CDDs this week, which is 6 below normal. The latest NWS forecast calls for normal temperatures for most of the nation, except for parts of the Midwest, Northeast and South Texas which will be below normal. Manufacturing activity, which consumes about 45% of all natural gas use, contracted for a 14th straight month in September but showed signs of improvement. The National Association of Purchasing Management monthly index dipped only slightly in September, slipping to 47.0 in its worst slump since the 1990-1991 recession. A reading under 50 indicates that manufacturing activity, about one-sixth of the overall economy, is declining. The NAPM index has now held below that level since August 2000, but has been steadily improving from January's 10-year low of 41.2. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally off $0.05 $0.10 yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.05 to $1.77 per MMBtu.

Restart of Dabhol Power Project Proposed



    A panel established by the Indian state of Maharashtra has suggested that if all parties involved are willing to absorb the costs, the 2,184 MW Dabhol power project could be re-started. The panel suggested that if all the shareholders were willing to absorb the costs, the tariff on Dabhol's power could be reduced. The panel has also proposed that Enron, GE and Bechtel absorb a huge loss on their investment in the project. After a acrimonious dispute with the local utility, Enron had said it would like to abandon the project. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board, which had initially contracted to purchase all the power from Dabhol plant, subsequently defaulted on payments because it didn't need that much power and claimed it was too expensive. Enron claimed the utility was in violation of its contractual obligations. Dabhol took the dispute to the International Court of Arbitration in London, but Enron has said it would settle out of court if it could recover its costs.

Congress to Hold Hearing on Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline




    Congress plans to consider a multi-billion dollar pipeline project to transport natural gas from Alaska today. A consortium of oil companies last week released a gloomy report on the project's economics. BP, Phillips Petroleum and Exxon Mobil unveiled a preliminary study on the project last week that showed smaller investment returns than previously estimated. The project is uneconomical at this point, but despite the study the project has not been shelved. The consortium will likely make a decision on the project by the and of the year. Depending on the route, it may cost between $15 billion and $17 billion. The 2000-mile southern route parallels the TAPS to Fairbanks, then turns to follow the Alaska Highway through the Yukon Territory and British Columbia, connecting with existing pipelines in Alberta. The 1,650-mile northern route runs east from the North Slope to the Mackenzie River delta, then south along the Mackenzie valley into Alberta. It would be cheaper, but would have to cross the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources will hold a hearing today on legislation that may be needed to move pipeline construction forward. The hearing will  focus on ways the federal government can help improve project economics. The consortium has requested fast-track approval of FERC permits, but no direct federal subsidies for construction costs. The Bush administration says the project must be independently feasible and not rely on subsidies. Natural gas from Alaska could make up 10% of nations energy supplies by 2015, according to a study from the Interstate Natural Gas Supply Association of America.

California Has a Plan in Case Bond Sale Delayed




    Californias controller says that the state is on solid economic ground and is not facing a fiscal emergency, even if a proposed bond sale is postponed. The state is attempting to issue $12.5 billion in bonds to repay the general fund for $6.1 billion spent on buying power for Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison. The bond sale is being held up because state regulators have not approved the designation of a portion of the utilities rates to repay the bonds. Last month, the state sold $5.7 billion in revenue anticipation notes to boost the general fund and provide a buffer until the bonds can be sold. Since revenue anticipation notes must be repaid by the end of the fiscal year, California could issue revenue anticipation warrants to repay the notes if the bonds are not issued before. The state treasurer has warned that the states budget deficit could rise to $9.3 billion by the beginning of fiscal year 2003 if the bonds are not issued by then and state lawmakers would have to consider raising taxes or cutting spending.
