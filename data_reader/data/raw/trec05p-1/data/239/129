Energy Consumers and Producers… 

Are you a consumer that hesitated to buy forward in 2000 or bought too soon last year?  Are you a producer who hedged too early in 2000 and did not hedge enough in early 2001?  Did you take undue credit risk because you did not know how to estimate exposure?  Are you comforting yourself with the fact that you did not hedge to make money?  Let's face it - you did not hedge to lose money either.  Kase's Derivatives for Energy Professionals will provide you with the indispensable strategies and tactics you need to avoid costly errors and equip you to make the important hedging decisions necessary for survival in today's treacherous marketplace.
