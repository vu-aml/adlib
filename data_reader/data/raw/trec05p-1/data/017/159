Dorie,

Tim Belden and I are looking into chartering a plane to fly 8 people from Portland.  The cost is approx $20K.  Commercial flights require two legs to Vail or a flight to Denver plus the drive.  Either would take 5-7hours each way. Lavorato said this was OK so long as we did not "break the bank" on the charter.

The Enron Americas Management Offsite has been scheduled for August 16-19, 2001 in Beaver Creek, Colorado.
Charter aircraft will be available between Houston and Eagle/Vail Airport - flight itinerary is listed below:
Thursday, August 16 - 5:00pm departure from Enron Aviation at George Bush Intercontinental Airport (arriving in Eagle/Vail at approximately 6:00pm)
Sunday, August 19 - 9:00am departure from Eagle/Vail Airport (arriving at Enron Aviation at approximately 12:00pm)

You have the option of flying into Houston and taking this charter flight or you can work with your local travel agent to obtain personal travel into either Denver International or Eagle/Vail.  Enron will provide ground transportation from both airports.  Flights into Eagle/Vail are very limited during the summer months.  Driving time from Denver to Beaver Creek is approximately 2 1/2 hours and approximately 35 minutes from Eagle/Vail to Beaver Creek.

Once travel has been confirmed, please provide me with a copy of your itinerary so I can secure the proper ground transportation.

Please let me know if I can be of assistance or if you have any questions.
Thanks.
