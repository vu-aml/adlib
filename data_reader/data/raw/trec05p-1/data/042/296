Dearest Friend,

In good faith and with due respect and humility, I write to you this proposal. I am the manager of the bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of STANDARD CREDIT UNION BANK ABIDJAN. I discovered an abandoned sum of U.S$8.5m Eight million, five hundred thousand US dollars. In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 1999 in a plane crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come forward and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and policies but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relations died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claims. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin to the deceased. it will be safely transferred to your nominated account and subsequently the funds will be disbursed accordingly to each parties involved in the transaction since nobody is coming forth and i don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.

According to our Banking policies and guideline here, It stipulates that if such funds remained unclaimed after SIX years, the money will automatically be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and an Ivorian like me cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

I agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be for reimbursement of any expenses incurred during the curse of the transaction and 60 % would be for me. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as next of kin to the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easier and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.

Upon receipt of your positive response, I will send to you by email the text of the application, I will also Not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required modalities and arrangements have been made for the transfer of the fund with immediate effect.

Please call me as you receive this mail on my private allocated telephone Number +22507073434 Trusting to hear from you immediately

Yours faithfully,

Dr. James West.
