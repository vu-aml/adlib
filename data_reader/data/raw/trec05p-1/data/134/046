He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=1558&key=1094&"><B>Emmitt Smith</B></A>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice !

However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=1558&key=235174&"><B>Chris Weinke</B></A>, QB CAR - Tori <FONT SIZE=!

Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco.

He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=1558&key=1248&"><B>Cris Carter</B></A>, WR MIN - Tori <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR!
><!
FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=1558&key=12576&"><B>Randy Moss</B></A>, WR MIN - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=1558&key=133448&"><B>Ricky Williams</B></A>, RB NO - Bass/Hull <FONT S!

He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=1558&key=1440&"><B>Stephen Davis</B></A>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player.

Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=1558&key=1456&"><B>Richard Huntley</B></A>, RB CAR - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings.

Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis.
