           CUT BACKS IN 2002: BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT
                  OR JUST PLAIN BUSINESS RISK?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

THE BIG BANG IN 2001

2001 was a year like no other. The magnitude of events and 
economic repercussions, have been difficult to manage for many. 
We, as industry participants, have witnessed tremendous 
uncertainty and price volatility, which resulted in stratospheric 
price increases and the collapse of energy markets. As markets 
died (actually returned to historical lows) and as industry 
participants filed for bankruptcy, we are left with the question 
"What next?".

INDUSTRY IN FLUX

The industry is in a state of flux once again and floundering 
badly. The California experiment and the Enron model proved to be 
economic disasters that may never be rivaled. After the fallout, 
who is left to blame? Do we scapegoat it to the California 
regulators, to those eager to make a buck or to an overriding 
failure of all us to recognize the complexity and unique nature 
of the energy industry.

CUTBACKS AND LAY-OFFS

The worrisome reaction of many industry participants (coast to 
coast), at this time, has been to dramatically cut capital 
spending and reduce staff. This may seem a safe option given the 
relative calm of energy prices, in our opinion this strategy may 
be suspect in the long-term. The forthcoming changes from 
regulators, and from within the industry itself, will be massive 
and will require significant resources to implement.

Will you be ready for the onslaught? Business protocol must 
change and that change will be all encompassing. US Federal 
Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, expressed confidence that there 
would be significant changes to accounting practices and 
corporate governance (of the energy industry) as a result of the 
Enron/Anderson scandal.

THE CERTAINTY OF CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY

If we have learned anything in the last six years, since the 
opening of the Alberta Power Pool on January 1 1996, it is that 
the market is violently uncertain. There is no indication that 
the industry will stabilize any time soon. The other not so 
obvious observation is that those corporations operating in 
competitive markets with solid infrastructure, effective trade 
and risk policy and the ability to intelligently analyze large 
amounts of data have come into 2002 in relatively good shape. The 
industry as it is currently situated suggests a need for some 
level of conservatism without compromising corporate integrity. 
Perhaps now is not the time to cutback, but rather to shore-up 
while there is a break in the storm.

HOW ARE YOU POSITIONED

What corporations should be asking is how actions I am taking 
today will impact tomorrow's business opportunities. We know many 
are cutting back on expenditures, but is this at the cost of risk 
exposure or lost opportunity. There is limited risk as long as 
prices are low; but we all know that the industry has thus far 
behaved outside of anybody's expectations. There is no reason why 
uncertainty will not continue to prevail.
