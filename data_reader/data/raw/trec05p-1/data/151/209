HIGH COURT CONSIDERS FEDERAL RULE TOLLING STATE LAW
LIMITATION PERIODS

The U.S. Supreme Court hears oral arguments in a case
examining the constitutionality of a Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure that tolls the statute of limitations in a state
law claim while a related action is brought in federal court
("Raygor v. Regents of the Univ. of Minn.,  "U.S.,  No.
00-1514,  "oral argument", 11/26/01 ).

Lance Raygor and James Goodchild, former employees of the
University of Minnesota, ask the justices to overturn the
Minnesota Supreme Court's January 2001 ruling finding
unconstitutional a state appeals court's decision that the
lower court's application of 28 U.S.C. Section  1367(d),
part of the federal supplemental jurisdiction statute, was
barred by sovereign immunity under the 11th Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution because it impermissibly prolonged the
state's exposure to liability.  The university, however,
urges the justices to affirm, arguing that Section 1367(d)
is unconstitutional. . . . Page AA-1

SUPREME COURT DECLINES TO REVIEW APPEALS COURT RULING ON
SUBCONTRACTING

The U.S. Supreme Court declines to review an appeals court
decision that a ready-mix concrete company violated the
National Labor Relations Act by selling its trucks and
hiring independent contractors to perform delivery work
without first bargaining to impasse over the issue
("Naperville Ready Mix Inc. v. NLRB, "U.S., No. 01-280,
"cert. denied" 11/26/01). The owner of Naperville Ready Mix
Inc. and two related companies announced during contract
negotiations with International Brotherhood of Teamsters
Local 673 that he wanted to sell the delivery trucks to
owner-operators. The owner supplied the financing, did not
require any down payment, required buyers to give first
priority to Naperville's hauling needs, restricted
purchasers from working for competitors, sold subsidized
fuel, provided truck repair services, and allowed free truck
storage on site.

The Seventh Circuit in March 2001 upheld the National Labor
Relations Board's ruling that the plan to shift delivery
work from employee drivers to subcontractors was a mandatory
subject of bargaining. The change to using subcontract
haulers was motivated by a desire to save on labor costs and
was not a core entrepreneurial decision beyond the scope of
the companies' obligation to bargain with the union, the
appeals court decided. . . . Page AA-4,  Text E-1

ELEVENTH CIRCUIT SAYS EX-EMPLOYEES MAY SUE UNDER ADA

Former employees may sue under the Americans with
Disabilities Act to challenge limits on post-employment
benefits, a divided Eleventh Circuit rules, reversing its
position in an earlier case that ex-employees are not
covered. In an issue of first impression in the Eleventh
Circuit, Judge Pollak remands to a federal district court in
Florida a case brought by a former Kmart employee forced to
resign because of emotional illness ("Johnson v. Kmart
Corp., "11th Cir., No. 99-14563, 11/21/01). In reversing the
circuit's position in "Gonzales v. Garner Food Servs. Inc.",
Judge Pollak cites an intervening Supreme Court decision
that ex-employees may sue under Title VII of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act, the law from which the ADA's definition of
employee is drawn.

The court says a narrow reading of ADA Section 12112(a) to
exclude coverage of former employees "would not only bar a
whole class of plaintiffs from access to remedies regarding
the administration of post-employment benefits," but also
would nullify sections of ADA Title I that protect against
discriminatory discharge and authorize courts to order
reinstatement. Judge Carnes dissents, arguing that because
the Supreme Court did not expressly overrule " Gonzales",
the case is still good law. . . . Page A-1,  Text E-10

RESEARCH BUREAU SAYS RECESSION BEGAN IN MARCH

The National Bureau of Economic Research says the U.S.
economy fell into recession in March, ending a 10-year
expansion that was longer than all others in the nation's
history. Widely anticipated by private forecasters, NBER's
pronouncements are regarded as the official word on business
cycle turning points.

The NBER's finding that the recession began in March means
the downturn is already nearly nine months old. Recent jumps
in unemployment, as well as other indicators of the weak
economy, were cited by the bureau as evidence that the
downturn merits being termed a recession. . . . Page A-6,

JUSTICES DECLINE TO REVIEW COURT'S DISMISSAL OF NAFTA
CHALLENGE

The U.S. Supreme Court lets stand an appeals court ruling
that courts have no jurisdiction to determine whether the
president and Congress had the constitutional authority to
enact the North American Free Trade Agreement ("United
Steelworkers of Am. v. United States, "U.S., No. 01-5,
"cert. denied" 11/26/01). The United Steelworkers and the
Made in the USA Foundation sought review of a March decision
by the Eleventh Circuit finding that the suit raised a
political question over which the court had no jurisdiction.

The leaders of the United States, Canada, and Mexico signed
the NAFTA agreement in December 1992, and Congress approved
and implemented the agreement one year later on a majority
vote. The plaintiffs alleged that NAFTA's approval
circumvented the Constitution's Treaty Clause which requires
two-thirds approval by the Senate. . . . Page AA-2,  Text
