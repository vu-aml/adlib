<1> 	Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Trader:

Traders needed to be nimble and quick this week to take
advantage of sudden, sharp moves in the commodity markets
highlighted by gains in Cattle, Cocoa, Coffee and Wheat and
declines in Crude Oil, Gold and Hogs.  Meanwhile, the Dollar
stood strong and Stocks put in another solid performance
helped by progress in the U.S.-led campaign in Afghanistan,
although another sharp drop in U.S. industrial production
tempered enthusiasm.  Export rumors fired up Wheat as well
as Soybeans which racked up five-week highs.  While
confusion over OPEC's output intentions dominated the
headlines, the soft global economy was the underlying factor
weighing on Crude, while Natural Gas came under pressure
from unusually warm weather conditions.  Copper was firm,
but tentative, Gold was weak, and a rally in Orange Juice
fizzled out.
