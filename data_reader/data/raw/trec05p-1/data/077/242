Michael - as I said in my voice mail message - Lisa has mentioned two separate issues identified in the bullet below - in CA there is a Zero Emissions Vehicle Program designed to increase the use of ZEVs and there is also a Mobile Emission Reduction Credit (MERC) Program geared towards allowing mobile emissions reductions to be used as offsets for stationary source emissions.  Do you need info on both or one or the other?  Thanks

In addition to assistance with their business plan, Trevor and Michael are interested in the following information:

EMA participant list - LJ to fax
Assessment of GHG and CO2e market value - LJ to send
Information of the "Zev" program -- California program for mobiles emissions (with trading piece) - Mary could you please give Michael a ring to discuss this request?
Update on MERCs in Texas - Stacey may have already done this
Update on the new Enron Building and any opportunity for offsets - Stacey and Mary, please let me know if you can provide an update on this to Trevor and Michael (or just cc me on whatever you send)

Thanks and please let me know if you have any questions.
