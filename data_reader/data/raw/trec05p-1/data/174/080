Investment ideas 
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
It's playing long in Peoria
Media issues tend to anticipate a recovery, but some 
stocks are already over-bought

By Charles Payne, principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

The media group is one that investors should watch very closely over the 
next several months. These stocks are known as early cyclical issues 
because their share price usually improves long before the broad 
economy does. However, other cyclical sectors have actually seen their 
fortunes turn in anticipation of the economy, while media stocks in 
general have been sluggish. Last week the big names in the group were 
downgraded by Credit Suisse First Boston, as much because of internal 
issues as because of macro conditions. Ad sales on television are now 
estimated to be off by 8 percent, while only a few weeks ago most 
industry observers thought the sales number would be off by 5 percent. 
In fact, for the next couple of months, it is believed that prime time spots 
for the networks will decrease by 30 percent. Nevertheless, if these 
stocks live up to their reputation and outperform up to nine months 
before the broad economy improves, there could be reason to discount 
the current bad news and look at the group as an intermediate to long-
term investment.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
The most recommended stocks on Wall Street
Analysts look to old economy stocks for profits now

By Thomas J. Ryan, equity research columnist 

A handbag manufacturer, a regional health insurer and a used-car dealer 
make for a motley crew, but they all rank among Wall Street's most-
recommended stocks.

What all three companies--Coach (COH), WellPoint Health Networks 
(WLP), and Copart (CPRT)--have in common is a proven ability to 
grow sales and earnings, especially during downturns. The picks 
underscore Wall Street's efforts to search across sectors to find clear 
winners in today's recessionary climate.
