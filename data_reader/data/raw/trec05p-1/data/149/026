Do we want to just ask Colonial Oil to let us out of this position?

Jim,

Is the size of the cargo that Enron would need to purchase approx 280,000 bbls with a value of roughly $6 million ?
What would the payment terms be from Colonial ?

Regards!

I have a term sale to Colonial Oil for 1 cargo per month into Jacksonville Florida. I did not deliver the November cargo and they agreed to wait until Dec 10th. I can't perform on this commitment unless we can open an LC or pre pay in order to buy a cargo. Money would not be tied up more than a few days. Would like to perform and avoid any potential additional costs and/or damage to our credibility due to non-performance. Please advise.

Jim,

Please call me ASAP regarding the December cargo.  We are baseline
sensitive.  We need a cargo into the system at the very latest December
10th, would prefer few days earlier.   

Also do you have current duty drawback that can be assigned?
