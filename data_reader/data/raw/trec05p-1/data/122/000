Enron fires two employees linked to partnerships

    NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. <ENE.N>, the
embattled energy trader, said on Thursday fired its treasurer
and a counsel who the company said were part-owners of one of
its off-balance sheet partnerships now under investigation by
U.S. regulators.
    Enron said it was terminating the employment of Ben Glisan,
managing director and treasurer of Enron Corp., and Kristina
Mordaunt, a managing director and counsel of an Enron division.
    Enron said it believes that these two employees, along with
four other former Enron employees, were involved as partners in
a limited partnership called the LJM1 that had dealings with
Enron.
   Shares of Enron were trading down 5 cents or .55 percent at
$9 on the New York Stock Exchange.
