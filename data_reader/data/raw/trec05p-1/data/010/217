Love does much but money does all. . Always you are to be rich next year. . A wise man shall hold his tongue till he sees his opportunity. .
Few words and many deeds. . Make hay while the sun shines. . The best things in life are free. .

Absence makes the heart grow fonder. . Don't cross your bridges until you come to them. . The darkest hour is before the dawn. .
