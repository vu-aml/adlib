NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Watters is close to returning from a shoulder injury, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. "The plan is (for Ricky) to practice this week. Whether he can play this Sunday, that's another question," coach and general manager Mike Holmgren said. It is unclear whether Watters will take back the starting job from Shaun Alexander, although we think it's unlikely he will. However, Watters could take away carries from Alexander, hurting his Fantasy value during the most important weeks of the season.

Jon Ritchie <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=30! 88! &key=12652&>, RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Ritchie is expected to miss Sunday's game against Kansas City, and perhaps more, due to a sprained ankle. He will be replaced at fullback by Zack Crockett, who often gets goal-line chances.

Keith Poole <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1779&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Poole could miss his second straight game Sunday against Seattle due to bruised ribs. He's merely a marginal Fantasy player to begin with, so don't use him if there is any question whether he will play.

Rod Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matt! y ! Updated 12/04/01
Smith is questionable for Sunday's game against Seattle due to his sprained left ankle. He will test the injury at practice on Wednesday, so monitor his progress before you make a decision on using him this week.

Dominic Rhodes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=236986&>, RB IND - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Rhodes is recovering from a srained right wrist and a low back bruise. However, The Indianapolis Star reports that he is expected to play in Monday's game. 

James McKnight <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
McKnight suffered a rib injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play Monday. The Miami Herald reports that he will resume practicing on Wednesday. 

Chris Chambers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Chambers is expected to practice Wednesday and The Miami Herald reports that he will play Monday. Chambers is recovering from a rib injury he suffered in Sunday's game. 

James Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Hunter Updated 12/04/01
Jackson, still recovering from an ankle injury, might play in Sunday's game against New E! ng! land. The Akron Beacon Journal reports that he was held out of last Sunday's game in an effort to get him healthy for the last five matchups. 

Randy Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 12/04/01
Moss suffered a bruised right elbow during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The injury isn't serious, however, and he is expected to start in Week 13 against Tennessee. 

Cameron Cleeland <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=12277&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Cleeland, who has missed several weeks due to an ankle injury, is expected to return this week against Atlanta. In fact, the ! Times Picayune is reporting that Cleeland is probable for the contest. If you need a tight end for Week 13, Cleeland is definitely an option, barring any setbacks. 

Kris Mangum <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1672&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Mangum's neck injury may be more serious than what was originally thought. He continues to be hampered by the injury, and will be evaluated on a day to day basis. 

Tyrone Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1499&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Davis was activated for Monday night's game against Jacksonville. He saw limited playing time, and won't make much of an impact from a Fantasy perspective. 

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Banks suffered an ankle injury during Sunday's 20-10 loss to Dallas. However, he is expected to practice on Wednesday and will remain Washington's starting quarterback in Week 13 vs. Arizona. 

Stephen Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
According to the Washington Post, Alexander (broken fibula) is likely out for ! th! e remainder of the 2001 season. He suffered the injury during Sunday's 20-10 loss to Dallas, and will be replaced by Walter Rasby and Zeron Flemister. 

Dave Moore <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1369&>, TE TB - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Moore underwent an MRI on his injured hip on Monday, and coach Tony Dungy said that he could miss Sunday's game against Detroit. Todd Yoder would start in Moore's absence, but neither player has much Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues. 

Kevan Barlow <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 12/04/01
Barlow, who missed Sunday's game against Buffalo due to a shoulder injury, is expected to return to practice on Wednesday. He'll play in Week 13 barring any setbacks, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team. 

Terrell Owens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 12/04/01
Owens, who is still dealing with both foot and ankle injuries, will be in the starting lineup for the Niners on Sunday against St. Louis. Owens said he's still not 100 percent healthy but that he "did better than I expected" in Sunday's 35-0 win over Buffalo. 

Jeff Thomason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1333&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Thomason is still nursing a hyperextended knee, and will likely miss practice this week. He's doubtful for Sunday's game against San Diego. 

Freddie Mitchell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=235231&>, WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
According to published reports, Mitchell is close to replacing Todd Pinkston as Philadelphia's No. 2 receiver. "They both play about the equal number of plays," coach Andy Reid said. "Every week we're giving Freddie more responsibility, and he's coming along very well. He's the No. 2 wideout [behind Pinkston] at that position right now." If you're in a deeper league and need a wideout, Mitchell may be worth taking a chance on. 

Mike Vanderjagt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=12783&>, K IND - Hunter Updated 12/04/01
Vanderjagt is expected to play this weekend, according to published reports. He suffered a pulled back muscle in Sunday's game. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 12/04/01
Culpepper's status for this weekend's contest against Tennessee is uncertain at this time. "If his knee is in better shape, then he'll play," Green told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. "If it's not, then he probably will not." Todd Bouman, who threw two late touchdowns against Pittsburgh, would start in Culpepper's absence! . ! 

Anthony Thomas <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 12/04/01
According to the Chicago Daily Herald, Thomas should be back in the starting lineup this weekend. He will be limited in practice all week, but barring any setbacks he should be able to play against Green Bay. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Walls, who suffered a hyperextended ankle on Sunday, should be able to return to practice by Thursday. He's questionable for Sunday's game at Buffalo at this point, but he should be able to play barring any setbacks. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/04/01
Bettis, the NFL's rushing leader, most likely will miss Pittsburgh's game against the New York Jets on Sunday because of groin and hip injuries. Bettis was listed Tuesday as doubtful, meaning there is a 25 percent chance he could play. Coach Bill Cowher said even that might be overestimating his chances. "We'll see how he is by the end of the week but, by listing him as doubtful, you can see where I'm heading," Cowher said. If Bettis can't play, he would be replaced by Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala and Amos Zereoue. Fuamatu-Ma'afala had 12 carries for 74 yards Sunday. 

Chris Chandler!  <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
According to Head Coach Dan Reeves, Chandler's injured ankle will be evaluated in practice on Wednesday. "According to the doctor, we've got a chance with Chris this week," Reeves said. "There wasn't a lot of swelling. It's going to be sore. Wednesday is going to be the key for him." Michael Vick would start against New Orleans if Chandler can't go. 

Mike McMahon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
McMahon, being groomed as Detroit's quarterback of the future, will make his first start for the winless Lions at Tampa Bay this week. He will replace Charlie Batch, who likely is out for the season after separating his right shoulder in Sunday's 13-10 loss at Chicago. Ty Detmer will back up McMahon, and a third quarterback will be added later in the week. McMahon does throw downfield with some success, and he is worth consideration as a Fantasy backup. 

Jets <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=20&>, DT NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
CB Aaron Glenn may miss up to four weeks with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. His loss may mean the defense will blitz more often to protect the secondary, but the unit may also allow more passing yards in the next few games.! 

Jay Riemersma <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1662&>, TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Riemersma suffered a concussion in Sunday night's game. His current status is day to day.

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 12/03/01
George aggravated an ankle injury on Sunday. He should be able to play at Minnesota next week.

Desmond Clark <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=133250&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Clark suffered a strained groin in Sunday's game. His current status is day to day.
