I am waiting on a list of people who have signed with UBS - I requested one yesterday afternoon from HR.  I will send an e-mail when we get the security set up.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Can you make sure that the guys in Calgary have access to the new fundy's site. I am having problems getting in.
