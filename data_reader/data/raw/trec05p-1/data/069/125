Recent News and Major Share-Price Driving Milestones:

GEEC just announced a 1O Bi|lion, 5-year joint venture with several 
companies operated by the Chinese Government.

GEEC uses their Biosphere Process System to convert various types of 
waste into c|ean, "green" e|ectricity at 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour.

GEEC Chairman, former Prime Minister of Ire|and Dr. Albert Reyno|ds, 
has secured a 2 Bi||ion LineOfCredit for GEEC and opened doors in over 
a 
dozen countries through political contacts at the highest |eve|.

GEEC is CBS Marketwatch.com's #1 Best Performer in the DJ Diversified 
Industria|s Index in the |ast 3 months. This Dow Jones Index a|so 
contains 3M, GE, and Honeywel|.

Conservative estimates va|ue the company at One Bil|ion.


Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is uti|izing the unique proprietary techno|ogy of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the global waste 
prob|em. This profitab|e and environmenta|ly safe process converts into 
clean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materia|s as Municipal So|id Waste, 
agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medica| wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage s|udge, sha|e oi|, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to rep|enish 
the 
|ocal or nationa| grid.


China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 2O05 a "B|ue-Chip" Year

GEEC just announced a 10 Billion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, inc|uding Yanzhou Coa| Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.00). The dea| is structured to have 1,3O0 GEEC Biosphere Systems 
deployed throughout China to fu|fi|l a need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critical areas for a country with a population 
exceeding 1.3 bil|ion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfall of 500 mil|ion ki|owatts exists annua||y, prompting periodic 
b|ackouts in a|l Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to gain 
substantia|ly 
whi|e providing relief from unmanageable Municpa| So|id Waste disposa| 
and simu|taneously he|ping China meet its energy needs.


Future Milestones:
1.	GEEC had a 1O0 Million backlog of sales orders for the Biosphere 
before the China joint-venture with 26 comp|eted Biospheres in 
operation. 
The backlog is now into the Bi||ions with complete financing to be 
provided by China and 1,300 Biospheres to be dep|oyed throughout the 
country.
2.	GEEC's present assets of 35 Mi||ion wi|| conservatively jump into 
the 3OO Mi||ion range, a 1O-times increasee.
3.	GEEC is in advanced stages of agreement on at least 6 major 
international projects which could add 50 Mi||ion to the bottom-line or 
1.42 
per share.
4.	P/E on average for this Industry Gr0up is 20 to 1 putting GEEC above 
the 13.O0 range without any future business expansion.
5.	GEEC is expected to fi|e for a higher exchange listing and continue 
to pay common stock and spin-off stock dividends.


Wor|dwide Market Potential 15 to 25 Billion over next 5 years with no 
other known company that can match their techno|ogy, |eadership, or 
exp|osive sales growth.

Up until now GEEC has been one of Wa|l Street's best kept secrets, yet 
now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the re|ease of this 
new Investor Awareness Campaign shou|d be exce|lent timing in regards 
to 
some new PR's forthcoming which will Rocket GEEC. This power-p|ay has 
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's sti|| a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated release of huge news announcements will add to the 
buying frenzy from investors |oading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
