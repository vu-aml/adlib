Five weeks removed from arthroscopic knee surgery, the Denver Broncos running back was taken by surprise Wednesday when told of news reports saying he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the season.   "At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday," Davis said.   Davis admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks.   He remained on the scout team Wednesday. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report.  </FONT>

According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him. </FONT>

Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL.  </FONT>

Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence.

According to the <I>

"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again." If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.</FONT>

Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.</FONT>

Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.</FONT>

According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular season game this season. Moore, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have setbacks in his recovery. "I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the <I>
Arizona Republic</I>
. "That's why we both handled it like we did in training camp and we paced him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't tell you when he'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have him." If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go. <BR>

Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction," head coach Tom Coughlin told <i>
The Florida Times-Union</i>
. "It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week." Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23. <BR>

Despite a great performance by Thomas Sunday against Cincinnati, the <I>
Chicago Tribune</I>
 reports that the Bears will continue to use an alternating system with him and James Allen. "We will continue to use them both," said offensive coordinator John Shoop. "Anthony did a great job today, though." As long as this duo continues to split carries, it's hard to recommend either as a weekly starter in a Fantasy league. We believe Thomas is the better long-term pick, though.<BR>
