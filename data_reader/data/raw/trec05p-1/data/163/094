It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my

Export Promotion Council =28SAEPC=29 who was with the Government delegation 
on a trip to your country for a bilateral conference talk to encourage 
foreign investors=2E I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation 
with you in the execution of the deal hereunder for the benefit of all 
parties and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of 
this business=2E

Within the Department of Minerals & Energy where I work as a Director 
of Audit and Project Implementation and with the co-operation of two 
other top officials=2C we have in our possession an overdue payment in US 
funds=2E

The said funds represent certain percentage of the total contract value 
executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm=2C 
which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$26=2E500=2C000=2E00 
=28TwentySix Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars=29=2E Though the actual 
contract cost has been paid to the original contractor=2C leaving the excess 
balance unclaimed=2E

Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign 
contractors all debts owed=2C so as to maintain good relationship with foreign 
governments and non-government agencies=2C we included our bills for 
approvals with the Department of Finance and the South Africa Reserve Bank 
=28SARB=29=2E We are seeking your assistance to front as beneficiary of the 
unclaimed funds=2C since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts=2E 
Details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim 
to reflect payment and approvals will be secured on behalf of you=2Fyour 
Company=2E

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you 
be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation 
will be US$6=2E625m =2825%=29=2C while my colleagues and I receive US$17=2E225m 
=2865%=29 and the balance of US$2=2E650m =2810%=29 for taxation and miscellaneous 
expenses incurred=2E  

The business is completely safe and secure=2C provided you treat it with 
utmost confidentiality=2E  It does not matter whether you=2Fyour Company 
does contract projects=2C as a transfer of powers will be secured in favour 
of you=2Fyour Company=2E Also=2C your area of specialization is not a 
hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction=2E I have reposed my
