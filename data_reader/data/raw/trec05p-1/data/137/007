NGA Corporate Fellows
News from the National Governors Association's Corporate Fellows Program	 
November 2001 

NGA Outlines Vision For 2001-2002 

"The dawning of this new century and the convergence of globalization, technology, and deregulation have forced governors to ask important questions about the best way to govern. We are discovering the answers. In the 21st century, state leadership will be decisive."

Michigan Governor John Engler
NGA Chairman, 2001-2002

In response to recent challenges, state leadership is already rethinking government and implementing the following strategies:

Regarding families, the states are making strategic investments in the basic unit of society. These include providing lifelong learning opportunities and incentives for personal responsibility and self-sufficiency. NGA's strategies nurture civil society and encourage the kind of social and intellectual infrastructure needed for the 21st century.

NGA activities to support this legislative agenda include:

State Roundtables
Capitol Hill Forums
Site Visit Program
NGA Policy


Regarding the economy, the states are strengthening American competitive advantage in the world. By reshaping each state's economic environment to encourage clusters of innovation, governors are building a stronger national economy and states are prospering in the global marketplace.

NGA will support this competitiveness initiative through:

Policy Briefs
Clusters of Innovation Conference
Regional Forums


Regarding government, the states are reengineering the public sector to be more flexible, adaptable, customer-oriented, and performance driven. This means focusing on results, decentralizing decision making, and using technology to improve services.

As a Corporate Fellow, your organization will have a unique opportunity to participate and share in the dialogue that emerges from NGA's vision for 2001-2002. Through briefings with NGA senior staff, participation in Corporate Fellow advisory groups, and attendance at the NGA's Winter and Annual Meetings, your organization can share with the NGA in the fulfillment of its vision and contribute to better government.

If you are able to attend, please RSVP to Denise Harrison <mailto:dharrison@nga.org> by e-mail or at 202/624-5325.

On December 14, 2001 from 10:00 a.m. until 12:00 p.m., Gretchen Odegard, Legislative Director of Human Services of the NGA Human Resources Committee, will hold a meeting of private sector stakeholders to hear their recommendations for Congress on reauthorization.

Welcome New Fellows 

American Water Works Company, Inc. recently joined NGA's Corporate Fellows Program. American Water Works is the largest regulated water utility business in the United States. The company's utility subsidiaries and affiliates now serve approximately 10 million people in 23 states. American Water Works, whose interests are natural resources issues, has also joined the Corporate Fellows Advisory Group on Natural Resources. Mark Strand, Vice President, Government Programs, added that "As the largest private sector water company in the country, we look forward to making a valuable contribution to the NGA's Policy Studies Divisions. Water infrastructure repair will be a major issue facing state and local governments over the next decade, and we hope to share our experiences and ideas and contribute to solutions that are developed in the Center for Best Practices."

Corporate Fellows Advisory Groups 

With the support and involvement of the Corporate Fellows, the NGA Center for Best Practices helps the nation's governors frame solutions to today's most pressing concerns and tomorrow's public policy challenges. The Corporate Fellow advisory groups combine the voice and experience of both the private and public sectors to examine what works, what doesn't work, and what lessons can be learned from others grappling with similar problems and issues. These advisory groups (education, eGovernance, employment & social services, health and natural resources) meet during the Winter and Annual Meetings to discuss the year's work-plan and the role of Corporate Fellows; regular meetings of the Corporate Fellows' advisory groups take place throughout the year. If your organization is not involved in an advisory group and would like to join one, please contact Denise Harrison <mailto:dharrison@nga.org>.
