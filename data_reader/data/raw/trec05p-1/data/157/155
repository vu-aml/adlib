REF:HBOS/PRIVATE/PRIME/1107061978.

I am a senior partner in the firm of Prime Consultants:
Private Investigators and Security Consultants. 
We are conducting a standard process investigation on behalf of HALIFAX BANK OF SCOTLAND
(HBOS), the international Banking conglomerate located in the United 
Kingdom.

This investigation involves a client who shares the same surname with 
you and also the circumstances
surrounding investments made by this client at HBOS Republic,the 
Private Banking arm of the BANK OF 
SCOTLAND INTERNATIONAL. The HBOS Private Banking client died intestate 
and nominated no successor in
title over the investments made with the Bank. 
The essence of this communication with you is to request you provide us 
information/comments on any or all of the four issues:

1-Are you aware of any relative/relation who shares your same surname 
whose last known contact address
was Brussels Belgium?

2-Are you aware of any investment of considerable value made by such a 
person at the Private Banking
Division of HBOS PLC?

3-Born on the 1st of June 1927

4-Can you establish beyond reasonable doubt you eligibility to assume 
status of successor in title to
the deceased?

It is pertinent that you inform us ASAP whether or not you are familiar 
with this personality that we may
put an end to this communication with you and our inquiries surrounding 
this personality. You must
appreciate that we are constrained from providing you with more 
detailed information at this point. 
Please respond to this mail as soon as possible to afford us the 
opportunity to close this investigation.

Thank you for accommodating our inquiry.

Mrs.Loretta Carl,
