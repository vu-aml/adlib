Thanks, Tracy. The reclass turned out to be 43.3 mill, which is what I adjusted 3rd ce for. Is this the only adjustment you want us to make? We have a couple of other large items (goodwill, FAS 133), maybe at this point we should just include them in the current cash flow forecast. Let me know, thanks.

It is actually $45 million.  I would need I revised 3rd CE and also reflect the change in the cash flow forecast.  I am sorry I did not get back to you sooner on this.

Do you still need a revision of the 3rd current estimate? If so, should we update it for September actuals? Or should we revise the 3rd ce for the 43 mill revenue deferral to 2002 only, and report September actuals in the October monthly cash flow forecast? Let me know what you need, thanks.
