Today I'm compiling next years' budget with Mike Coleman and Wayne Mays.  We will run these budgets by Chris Calger and Dave Duran.  We think that we can support all of E.W.S. using less dollars than last years' budget.  We may elect to do everything in house.  In any event, this is just your information - no reply necessary.
