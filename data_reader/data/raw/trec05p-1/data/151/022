Hello=20
I know that this mail will come to you out of the blue
as a total surprise. Well, I have a business proposal
which I know might interest you. I believe that you
would be in a position to assist me in my bid to
transfer the sum of (USD18.5M.) Eighteen Million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollar into a foreign
bank account. So study the following account carefully
and reply urgently.  =20
I am Hassan Idrissa, an Auditor of a bank in here in south Africa.
During the course of our auditing, I discovered a
floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1993
and since 1997 nobody has operated on this account.
After a lot of investigation I discovered that the
owner of the bank account died without a inheritance
the money is floating and if I do not remit this money
out it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner of the
account is Mr. Magnus Mundigen, a foreigner. He died
since 1997 and the bank account has no other
beneficiary. My investigation proved to me that nobody
knows about this account or anything concerning it.=20
So I want to grab this opportunity as it is no harm to
nobody.=20
I am here soliciting for your assistance as a
foreigner because the money can not be approved to a
local person here. It can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or drivers
license and foreign bank account because the money at
sake is in U.S dollars and the former owner of the
account is a foreigner. The management must approve
this payment to you if you have the correct
information of this account, which I will give to you,
upon your positive response and once I am convinced
that you are capable and will meet up with instruction
of key bank official who is deeply involved with me in
this project.=20
With my influence and the position of the bank
official, we can transfer this money to any
foreigner&#8217;s reliable account, which you can provide
with assurance that this money will be intact pending
our physical arrival at your end for sharing. Note
that an existing foreign bank account or an empty new
one can serve to receive this money. The bank official
will destroy all documents of the transaction
immediately this money is into your nominated bank
account. To build confidence you can come immediately
to south Africa in order to discuss with me face to face after
which I will make this remittance in your presence and
three of us will fly to your end some days ahead of
the money going into the account.=20
At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
20% of the total amount, 75% will be for the bank
official and I, while 5% will be for expenses both
parties might have incurred during the course of this
transaction.=20
May I stop here. Reply urgently so that I will inform
you the next step to take. Send also your private
phone and fax number including the full details of the
bank account to used for the deposit.=20
Best regards..
Hassan Idrissa=20
