I noticed that you have neither accepted nor declined our insurance as of today, 03/28/02.  According to your start date, your insurance would be effective 04/01/02.  In order to send the information to the insurance company by April 1st, we must receive that information from you by Friday, March 29, 2002.  Please let me know, either by e-mail or by phone (713-438-0919) if you choose to accept or decline.  If you choose to accept, fax the completed enrollment form to 713-438-0930.
