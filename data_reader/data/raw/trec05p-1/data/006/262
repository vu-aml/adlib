Gerald,

Have you had time to prepare this confirmation or are you still waiting on information from me?  We need to get this confirm out pretty quickly. I just noticed that it is just a month-long deal.  Let me know if you cannot prepare it without the Field names.

Thanks,
Judy

Gerald,

Here is another GTC Dedicated Reserves confirm that needs preparing. Here is the well information:

Field/County/State:	? /West Delta/Louisiana, Timbalier Bay/ LaFourche/Louisiana, ?/South Pass (South)/Louisiana
Well Name:		West Delta #35 Subsea, So Timbalier Bay 21, South Pass #78 Dehyd 
Meter No./Pipeline:	011413, 010442, 011492/ Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Working Interest:	100%

I am waiting on a call back with the field names for the West Delta and the South Pass wells.

Can we prepare the dedicated reserves confirms with just a delivery point or do we have to list all of the wells behind the delivery point?  

Thanks,
Judy
