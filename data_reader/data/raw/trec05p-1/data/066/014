Mike and Jeff :
Here is a copy of a new article from Bloomberg which featured Enron and crude. I think both Andrew and Matt displayed exceptional professionalism. I also think this reflects well on our business unit. In addition to the story, I have included Andrew's directives on this matter.

All,

Congratulations to Matt Anderson.  Through building and developing a network of media contacts Matt has been quoted by a Bloomberg Journalist in a news article.  Not only does this reflect well on Enron as a company, it also serves as a great reflection on the Fundamentals Group.  Well done Matt.

Portraying ourselves as a quotable and authoritative source will allow us to build credibility both internally and externally, so there is no reason why other groups cannot follow Matt's example.  However, given the potential pitfalls we would like to use this as an opportunity to point out a few vital do's and don'ts in order to avoid potential problems.

Do's

Do think very carefully about what you say - your comments will be seen my the masses and will reflect on both you and Enron.
Do pass your quotes and comments through your Line Manager who will approve them and get them certified by the Press Relations department - this is a company rule and something taken very seriously by Senior Management.


Do Not's

Do not comment on specific companies, Enron included.
Do not, ever, give investment advice or stock recommendations.  Not only is this company policy, it is also a legal requirement by the SFA.
Do not say anything you don't believe implicitly or can't justify and back up both plausibly and convincingly.

BN  09/27 Crude Oil Rises as OPEC May Reduce Production Later This Year         
                                                                                
Crude Oil Rises as OPEC May Reduce Production Later This Year                   
                                                                                
     Singapore, Sept. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Crude oil rose on                       
speculation that OPEC might cut production at a November meeting                
if prices don't rally in the weeks ahead.                                       
     The producers, after meeting yesterday in Vienna, left their               
output targets unchanged, though they've trimmed them by 3.5                    
percent this year as demand slipped from a sagging economy. Saudi               
Arabia is urging members to meet their quotas, which they exceeded              
by an estimated 3 percent in August. OPEC still may reduce                      
production if prices stay low, Iran's oil minister said.                        
     ``The focus on compliance is an intermediate step between a                
cut and doing nothing,'' said Matt Anderson, an analyst at Enron                
Corp. in Houston. ``They want credibility as guardians of oil                   
price stability, and don't want to be seen hurting the global                   
economy.''                                                                      
     Crude oil for November delivery rose 36 cents, or 1.6                      
percent, to $22.74 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange                 
during floor trading overnight. It rose another 21 cents to $22.95              
in after-hours electronic trading. Crude oil on Wednesday fell as               
low as $20.30 a barrel, the lowest since August 1999.                           
     Oil is still 17 percent below the level the day before                     
terrorists attacked the U.S. on Sept. 11.                                       
     Brent crude oil for November settlement yesterday fell 21                  
cents to $22.79 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange                
in London.                                                                      
     ``Our credibility is only as good as the continuation of the               
effort among our member countries'' to meet their quotas, said                  
Chakib Khelil, Algeria's oil minister and OPEC's president.                     
     The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has an                   
informal accord to cut supply if its price index stays below $22                
for 10 consecutive days, though Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ali                
al-Naimi, has indicated the group may not use that method for                   
boosting prices.                                                                
     Al-Naimi said yesterday that OPEC members would seek to                    
improve compliance with existing output targets as a means of                   
boosting prices.                                                                
                                                                                
                        Managing the Market                                     
                                                                                
     ``We have a strong willingness to manage the market,''                     
Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh told reporters after                 
meeting with al-Naimi in Vienna. ``We think that the non-OPEC                   
members should contribute with OPEC members to solve this                       
situation.''                                                                    
     OPEC's goal is to keep the price of its oil index within a                 
range of $22-$28 a barrel. The index was quoted at $20.11                       
yesterday.                                                                      
     Excluding Iraq, the only member without a quota, OPEC

exceeded its September quota of 23.201 million barrels a day by                 
5.8 percent, according to PetroLogistics, a Geneva-based                        
consulting firm. A Bloomberg survey early this month estimated                  
that the producers were 3 percent above their goals in August.                  
     The 10 OPEC members exceeded their combined quota this month               
by 1.35 million barrels a day, said Conrad Gerber, president of                 
PetroLogistics, which tracks oil shipments.                                     
     The producers said they will meet again on Nov. 14.                        
     Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez called for a meeting of the               
heads of state of OPEC members to define a strategy to defend                   
against slumping oil prices.                                                    
     ``We need to prepare another meeting,'' Chavez said late                   
yesterday on returning from a trip to Colombia. ``We have to                    
defend prices under any circumstances.''                                        
     OPEC heads of state met last year in Venezuela, their first                
summit since 1975. Venezuela in August was OPEC's third-biggest                 
producer, after Saudi Arabia and Iran, according to Bloomberg                   
estimates. Iraq was a close fourth.
