Shemin, I am fine with this change and the change in the amount for the
post-bankruptcy if that is what the business people agreed to.

I propose to add the following language to the Purchase Price paragraph
and otherwise both agreements are fine with me:
"The Purchase Price shall be paid to ENA by wire transfer of available
funds to the following account: Enron North America Corp., Citibank New
York, ABA 021 000 089, Acct# 40781075."

In addition, the contact information for Lloyd Don Miller is
713-853-0492
713-646-2555 (fax).

Mike, Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks for your help.

Shemin

Attached you will find minor revisions to these agreements marked in
red.
CIPCO is now an LLC so we have reflected it that way in the agreement.
We
also filled in information for the blanks.  Otherwise, everything looks
great.  Also, for your information, Brian S. Frederick, Vice President,
will sign the letter and escrow agreement for CIPCO.  CIPCO's tax ID #
is
84-1484857.  I filled in the contact information for the Escrow
Agreement.
Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
