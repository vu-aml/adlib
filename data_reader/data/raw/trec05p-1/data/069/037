Your last paragraph is right on man.  It just the commie business practice
that bites.

Again, my view of the world is that the transmission should be associated
with the sink control area - they are the one who takes it home.  The source
control area shouldn't have the fake transmission.

Guess part of the problem is due to CAs not registering as TPs which would
make things much more consistent.

PSEI will take NOR, SINGLEBUS, GF (if we're not looking), MIDC-MIDC, and
other creative entries for the OASIS number for MIDC-MIDC transactions.
