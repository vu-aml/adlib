Enron & FERC - Market Impact Overdone

* Enron credit position not a concern, in our view
Other energy merchants have credit mitigation & master netting
agreements. In any event, there is no evidence that ENE's credit
position is in serious jeopardy.
* Is Enron the market proxy?
We don't think so. ENE uses exotic off-balance sheet financial
engineering that we do not believe is prevalent in the group.
* FERC kicks out Pacificorp contract - denying CPUC complaint for now
We don't think this should have been at FERC to begin with.
Any further review would come under CA refund proceedings.
* Implicit conclusion is that FERC does not want to review bilateral
deals
FERC's long-running stance is that bilateral contracts are not up
for review or refunds. Recent Pacific Northwest ALJ ruling
supports view that bilateral deals are off-limits.
