FOX CALLS FOR GUESTWORKER AGREEMENT BY YEAR'S END; BUSH
HEDGES ON TIME

As the first White House official state visitor during the
Bush administration, Mexico's President Vicente Fox calls on
the United States and Mexican governments to reach an
agreement on immigration reforms by the end of the year.

White House officials say Bush shares many of Fox's
objectives, but decline to say that the administration also
has set the end of this year as a deadline for coming up
with such an agreement. As part of the immigration
discussion, the Bush administration is seeking a temporary
worker program with Mexico that is "grounded in reality and
the needs of our economy, and that doesn't hurt U.S.
workers," according to a White House statement.

The statement is silent about legalizing undocumented
workers who are currently in the United States, as proposed
by Fox and several U.S. lawmakers. Any U.S.-Mexico
guestworker program should recognize "the contributions
undocumented Mexicans are making in the United States,"
according to the White House statement. . . . Page AA-1

NLRB 2-1 REJECTS PARKING FIRM'S ATTEMPT TO BYPASS
AFTER-ACQUIRED CLAUSE

A California parking-facilities operator cannot demand a
representation election for a separate unit of employees of
a recently acquired company when a union sought inclusion of
those employees in an already existing bargaining unit
pursuant to an "after acquired" clause in a bargaining
contract, the National Labor Relations Board rules in a 2-1
decision ("Central Parking Sys. Inc., "335 N.L.R.B. No. 34,
8/27/01 [released 8/30/01]). Affirming a regional director's
dismissal of Central Parking System Inc.'s representation
petition, Members Liebman and Truesdale find that if the
company agreed to an after-acquired clause covering the
situation, it waived its right to demand an election. The
two members also find the petition must be dismissed because
International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 665 did not
seek recognition to represent a separate unit consisting
only of employees from the acquired company.

The majority defers to grievance arbitration to resolve the
remaining issues regarding the after-acquired clause.
Dissenting, Chairman Hurtgen asserts the validity of the
representation petition does not turn on the basis for the
union's recognition demand. The board, not an arbitrator,
should decide representation issues and assure employees'
rights are protected, Hurtgen says. . . . Page A-1

FIRST CIRCUIT OKS $400,000 IN PUNITIVES IN MANAGER'S
RETALIATION SUIT

The First Circuit affirms a $730,000 jury verdict for a
credit union financial planning manager whose chief
executive officer undercut her authority, stripped her of
management duties, pitted her co-workers against her, and
eventually terminated her after she filed sex and pregnancy
discrimination claims against the company ("Zimmerman v.
Direct Federal Credit Union,  "1st Cir., No. 01-1007,
9/4/01).

The evidence supported the jury's $400,000 award of punitive
damages based on Celia G. Zimmerman's claim that the chief
executive officer at Direct Federal Credit Union, David
Breslin, retaliated against her in violation of
Massachusetts's anti-discrimination law. The award was fair,
given that the "jury rationally could have found that
Breslin (and through him, Direct) mounted a deliberate,
systematic campaign to punish the plaintiff as a reprisal
for her effrontery in lodging a discrimination claim," the
court rules. The court further affirms the jury's decision
that Breslin tortiously interfered with Zimmerman's
advantageous relationship with her employer. . . . Page A-5

FORMER IUE OFFICIAL MAY PROCEED WITH RETALIATION CHARGES
AGAINST UNION

A former official of the International Union of Electronic
Workers who was suspended after criticizing the union's
president may proceed with his claim that he was retaliated
against for exercising his right to free expression in
violation of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure
Act, the District of Columbia Circuit rules ("Gilvin v.
Fire, "D.C. Cir., No. 00-7221, 8/21/01). Holding that the
former secretary-treasurer of IUE was protected by the
LMRDA, the D.C. Circuit reverses a lower court decision that
the law protects only the rights of union members, not union
officers. "That holding was an error of law," the court
said.

IUE suspended Ron Gilvin for refusing to sign checks
authorized by the union's president, Edward Fire. Gilvin,
who was subsequently recalled by IUE members, maintained
that the union violated his LMRDA rights to free expression
because the suspension was imposed in retaliation for his
criticism of Fire's plan to transfer money from the union's
strike fund to a general fund. He also questioned increases
in union subsidies to its district councils, as well as
raises and travel reimbursements authorized by Fire. . . .

NONMANUFACTURING CONTRACTS IN 2001 SHOW WEIGHTED GAIN OF 3.9
PERCENT

Data compiled by BNA in the first 36 weeks of 2001 showed
that the weighted average first-year wage increase in newly
bargained contracts in the nonmanufacturing sector
(excluding construction) was 3.9 percent compared with 4
percent in 2000. The median increase in these contracts was
4 percent, compared with 3.5 percent last year.
Manufacturing agreements provided a weighted average
increase of 3.1 percent, compared with 3.3 percent in 2000,
and a median of 3 percent, unchanged from the same period in
2000.

 Among new settlements included in the latest biweekly wage
tabulation include: an agreement between the Paper,
Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers and Procter &
Gamble; and a contract between Wisconsin Electric Co. and
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers . . .
