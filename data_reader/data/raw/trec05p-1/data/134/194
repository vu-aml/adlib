Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2111&key=1003&"><B>Jake Plummer</B></A>, QB ARI - Really Rottens <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit.

The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2111&key=1171&"><B>Warrick Dunn</B></A>, RB TB - President Taft <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseason. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2111&key=12795&"><B>Hines Ward</B></A>, WR PIT - Team Chick <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. While he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable totals.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2111&key=12375&"><B>Doug Flutie</B></A>, QB SD - President Taft!

FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2111&key=134327&"><B>Stacey Mack</B></A>, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh.

Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the league and is a must-start every week. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2111&key=1291&"><B>Jerry Rice</B></A>, WR OAK - Team Chick <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Rice had a huge game on Sunday, catching eight passes for 131 yards and three touchdowns against San Diego. Rice may not be an every-week starter in smaller leagues, but he can certainly still put up huge Fantasy numbers when the matchup is right. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2111&key=1062&"><B>Tony Banks</B></A>, QB WAS - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Banks was ca!

Bradford caught three passes for 117 yards against Atlanta.
