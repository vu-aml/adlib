Mark, I have next Wednesday at 3:00 to meet with you in advance of the law conference.  I am participating in Vicki's Retail offsite Wednesday morning.  When we meet, we can discuss whatever you would like re: Canada, but I thought I would list high level items that may be of interest.  We can discuss any or all of this as you would like:

1.  Staffing - I would like to discuss with you my earlier memo re: an additional Toronto lawyer
2.  Forms Development - Wholesale, but especially Retail
2.  PPA - I sent you an update e-mail on the outstanding issues but can give you an overview
3.  Alberta Wholesale Power - Progress since deregulation
5.  Alberta Wholesale Gas
4.  Ontario Wholesale Power - Progress to market opening
5.  Ontario Wholesale Gas
6.  Alberta Retail
7.  Ontario Retail
