Charlie, the D/R is the corrosion inhibitor application. If Gallup is the 14th and 15th it may be possible to move it before your Gallup ESD. What about after your Gallup ESD?

Jerry,  What is the D/R?  May 15 is a conflict with our Gallup ESD.  How
long will you be down, and can move that to May 9, 10, or another date that
shows no scheduled maintenance on this calendar?
Charlie
