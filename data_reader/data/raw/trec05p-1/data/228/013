Crude Oil Futures Slide Lower


    Crude oil futures for March delivery on the NYMEX dipped $0.68 to 
$20.73 per barrel yesterday as traders waited for the latest weekly 
inventory data. Many expect the API to show that oil inventories grew 
by at least 1.5 million barrels last week. However, supplies of 
gasoline are expected to show a small decrease because of production 
cuts by refineries. Heating oil inventories were also expected to 
drop as many expected that winter weather last week boosted demand. 
Fears that government-procured additions to the SPR could lower short 
term supplies fueled a big jump in crude prices on Monday, but appear 
to have lessened. Concerns that OPEC and non-member producers will 
not abide by their production cuts offered little support to the 
market. According to Platt's, OPEC is moving closer to compliance 
with their quotas. Platt's said that January production by the 
cartel, excluding Iraq, was still more than 1 million bpd over their 
limits, but 640,000 bpd below Decembers exports. Heating oil futures 
for March delivery on the NYMEX fell $0.0159 to $0.546 per gallon. 
March gasoline futures on the NYMEX slid $0.0181 to $0.6019 per 
gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for March delivery on the 
IPE were down $0.98 to $20.46 per barrel.

S&P Places PDVSA on CreditWatch 

    S&P has placed the senior unsecured notes of PDVSA Finance, a 
subsidiary of state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela, on CreditWatch with 
negative implications, after placing the credit rating of Venezuelas 
currency, the sovereign, on CreditWatch with negative implications. 
The CreditWatch affects $3.6 billion of US dollar-denominated notes 
and 200 million in euro-denominated notes. The rating on the PDVSA 
Finance notes will depend on S&P's assessment of changes in the level 
of sovereign risk and the extent to which the structure mitigates 
such sovereign risk. While a downgrade of the sovereign would not 
trigger an automatic downgrade of PDVSA Finance, the level of 
political control and influence of the government on PDVSA makes such 
an action likely. On a separate note, the recent news regarding the 
breach of contract brought claim against PDVSA by its joint venture 
partner, Lyondell Chemical, also underscores the sovereign risk 
inherent in public sector cross border future flow transactions. S&P 
is reviewing PDVSA's claim that the lawsuit will not have a have a 
material effect on it. While the lawsuit was not the reason for the 
CreditWatch placement, when reviewing sovereign risk for a structured 
transaction supported by government-owned assets, S&P takes into 
consideration the public sector entity's unwillingness or inability 
to abide by its agreements or contracts because of shareholder 
pressure. This is true for PDVSA Finance, since as of December 31, 
2001, up to 29% of the exports supporting PDVSA Finance's debt were 
sold to wholly owned subsidiary, CITGO Petroleum and a further 32% 
were sold to joint venture partners. S&P believes that during a 
sovereign stress scenario there is a greater likelihood that PDVSA 
would violate its agreements and redirect export revenues from CITGO, 
and to a lesser degree, its joint venture partners, than from 
nonaffiliated companies. Also, S&P has been notified by PDVSA that it 
is planning to cut production in March 2002, which could reduce crude 
oil deliveries to its joint venture partners and other customers by 
as much as 20%. While the cuts are expected to lead to lower debt 
service coverage levels, the extent of any reduction in coverage 
levels will depend on the effect the cuts have on future oil prices. 
S&P will continue to monitor coverage levels, which although 
declining, continue to be strong, with the ratio of exports revenues 
to debt service at a very comfortable 19 times in January 2002.

Shell Says Enron Vindicates Management Style

    The Enron crisis has changed the way analysts view Royal 
Dutch/Shell, silencing critics who once dismissed the it as an 
anachronism in an era of fast-paced energy traders, according to 
Shell Chairman Phil Watts at the Cambridge Energy Research Associates 
conference. Two or three years ago there was a fad and a fashion 
about and we were being criticized for being a bit too conservative, 
a bit too slow, a bit too capital-intensive, he said. Watts rejects 
the suggestion that Shell's large cash resources need to be spent. 
However, he says that the company has made it absolutely clear that 
acquisitions, divestments, mergers as well as organic growth are all 
part of the number of opportunities that we can take to grow value in 
the company. Watts described Shell as a believer in oil industry 
consolidation.

BP 4th Quarter Earnings Dip 62% 


    BP has reported that 4th quarter earnings fell 62% to $1.06 
billion, or $0.05 per share, from $2.8 billion, or $0.12 per share a 
year ago due to a decline in energy prices. However, it also says 
that its oil and natural gas production grew by 5.5% last year, more 
than double that of Royal Dutch/Shell, which had a 2% increase. 
ExxonMobil's production was up by 1%, which does not include problems 
in Indonesia because of political turmoil. BP said it has about $5.8 
billion in off the books debt, in addition to $21 billion of debt on 
its books and that the items are included in BP's annual report. BP 
contends that the off the balance sheet debt is transparent and as 
such very different from special purpose vehicles. BP said it found 
almost twice the amount of oil it produced in 2001 through the 
discovery of new fields and improved recovery rates at existing 
sites. Shells new reserves were only about 74% of its 2001 
production. Despite the higher production, profits from oil and 
natural gas production were cut in half to $2.37 billion. BP received 
an average $17.72 per barrel for its oil, 37% below a year ago, and 
$2.28 per Mcf of natural gas, a drop of 39%. This year, BP is aiming 
at $1.4 billion in performance improvements, with $600 million of 
that total to come from the chemicals unit due to higher sales and a 
9% cut in costs. Excluding one-time charges, the chemicals unit lost 
$67 million. BP plans to cut costs at the unit by $250 million this 
year, partially through job elimination. It will also reduce spending 
to $800 million from $1.2 billion last year at the unit. BP expects 
to invest $12-$13 billion this year, lower than last years $13.2 
billion, excluding acquisitions. More cutbacks are in store for the 
oil and natural gas exploration unit, where BP has already cut 120 
job in Alaska and 70 in Canada. Revenue in the 4th quarter fell by 
21% to $42 billion. BP raised its quarterly dividend by $0.0575 per 
share, up 10% from a year earlier.
