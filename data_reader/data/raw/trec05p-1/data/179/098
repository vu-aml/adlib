Attached is a list of deals.  Per Ed Sacks, the NIMO deals should be terminated.  I have not received a recent list of terminations since I returned so I'm sending this individually.
 
Thanks.  My holidays were quiet and restful.  Hope yours were great.

I have documentation showing that Select Energy Acquired Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing through a stock purchase agreement effective 11/30/01 and that they terminated Niagara's Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement dated 6/23/97 effective 12/2/01.  I do not show that Select canceled their agreement with EPMI, and there are outstanding physical deals with them.  I will let you know as soon as I find out from Ed Sacks in credit if we should terminate the NIMO deals where they stand or move them to Select and then terminate.
