 11/26/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Warrick is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers. He was taken for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter of Cincinnati's Week 11 loss to the Browns.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=575&key=1847&"><B>Jon Kitna</B></A>, QB CIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/26/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despite being benched at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ineffective Scott Mitchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the game. None of the Bengals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=575&key=1235&"><B>Keenan McCardell</B></A>, WR JAC - Tori Kuyk!

dall <FONT SIZE=1>
Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=575&key=134327&"><B>Stacey Mack</B></A>, RB JAC - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=575&key=1514&"><B>Qadry Ismail</B></A>, WR BAL - McKay Neal <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial,!
 H!
elvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=575&key=192266&"><B>Jason Brookins</B></A>, RB BAL - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=575&key=187386&"><B>Ron Dayne</B></A>, RB NYG - Martin Cuilla <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=575&key=1782&"><B>Tiki Barber</B></A>, RB NYG - The Klap <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=575&key=235249&"><B>LaDainian Tomlinson</B></A>, RB SD - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless.

However, he’s only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=575&key=1003&"><B>Jake Plummer</B></A>, QB ARI - Baja <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

He’s one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=575&key=1234&"><B>Willie Jackson</B></A>, WR NO - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Jackson had a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.spo!

He’s been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=575&key=1140&"><B>Tyrone Wheatley</B></A>, RB OAK - Tori Kuykendall <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Ga!

ONT SIZE=1>
Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=575&key=1011&"><B>Alex Van Pelt</B></A>, QB BUF - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one interception.

He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=575&key=12363&"><B>Jay Fiedler</B></A>, QB MIA - McKay Neal <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=575&key=133361&"><B>Donovan McNabb</B></A>, QB PHI - Eric !

 The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=575&key=1089&"><B>Ki-Jana Carter</B></A>, RB WAS - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=575&key=1762&"><B>Isaac Byrd</B></A>, WR CAR - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
