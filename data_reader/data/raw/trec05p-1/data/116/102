I don't believe this is a very difficult task to complete.  The legacy systems will require a little work, but they should allow queries based on transaction dates (volumes transacted during a given time period - RGS for gas and RPS for power).  Also, now that Ranger is almost complete, we should have feel pretty good about our settled volumes.  I'll follow up with our systems guys and give you a definite time frame.

Once we have our new systems in, this should be very simple...

Cleaning up e-mails and realized I had missed this one earlier.  Any thoughts on how we could do this for power?  ( I will take your thoughts on gas as well).  --Sally

Sally - 

We would like to begin tracking & measuring volumes transacted and settled in the retail business - by commodity.

Can we discuss how to get our arms around this and when we can begin to see weekly, monthly, quarterly data?


Thanks - Dan
