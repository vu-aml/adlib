  WHO IS JACK SCHITT??? The lineage is finally revealed. Many people are at a loss for a response when someone says "You don't know Jack Schitt!"  Read on and you'll be able to handle the situation intelligently. Jack is the only son of Awe Schitt and O. Schitt.  Awe Schitt, the fertilizer magnate, married O. Schitt, a partner of Kneedeep & Schitt, Inc. Jack Schitt married Noe Schitt and the deeply religious couple begat 6 children: Holie Schitt, Fulla Schitt, Giva Schitt, Bull Schitt, and the twins, Deap Schitt and Dip Schitt.  Against her parents wishes, Deap Schitt married Dumb Schitt, a high school dropout. After 15 years of marriage, Jack and Noe Schitt divorced.  Noe Schitt later married a Mr. Sherlock, and out of devotion to her children, decided to hyphenate her last name, and became Noe Schitt-Sherlock.  Dip Schitt married a woman named Loda Dung, who became Loda Schitt.  The couple produced a nervous son, Chicken Schitt.  Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt,  inseparable throughout childhood subsequently married the Happens brothers. The local newspaper announced the Schitt-Happens wedding, which was quite an event. The Schitt-Happens children were Dawg, Byrd, and Hoarse.  Bull Schitt, the prodigal son, left home to tour the world.  He returned from his travels with  his Italian bride, Piza Schitt. So, NOW if someone says " You don't know Jack Schitt", you can beg to differ. You not only know Jack Schitt, but the entire Schitt list!
