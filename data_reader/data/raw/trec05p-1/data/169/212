, RB SEA - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Alexander carried seven times for 27 yards and a TD in relief of an injured Ricky Watters on Sunday. He saw limited action until Watters went down in the second half, and his playing time may continue to be sparse when Watters is healthy.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=3435&key=1094&"><B>Emmitt Smith</B></A>, RB DAL - Pink Panthers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Smith was virtually useless on Sunday, running for only 39 yards on 12 carries vs. Seattle. Smith can be productive when he gets enough carries, but he’s a real gamble during the Fantasy playoffs otherwise.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=3435&key=235201&"><B>Quincy Carter</B!

/A>, QB DAL - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Carter had a horrible game on Sunday, going 14-of-33 for 135 yards with an interception against Seattle. He has no value as a Fantasy player in any league. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=3435&key=133263&"><B>Daunte Culpepper</B></A>, QB MIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Culpepper will probably need to undergo arthroscopic surgery this week on a sprained left knee that kept him out of the Vikings 27-24 loss to Detroit on Sunday.  "It's a small scope, not a big deal at all," Minnesota coach Dennis Green said. "Whether it's a 10-day injury or a two-week injury, you never know." Culpepper had been expected to play this week after sitting out last week. He began the week listed as probable, but was downgraded to doubtful after his knee was still swelling and sore after taking some snaps on Wednesday and Thursday. He sat out of Friday's practice and was officially listed as inactive.     </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=3435&key=1160&"><B>Lamar Smith</B></A>, RB MIA - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Smith carried nine times for only 22 yards at San Francisco.

Fiedler threw for 149 yards, no TDs and was intercepted three times at San Francisco. The Miami QB is too erratic to be a regular starter for any Fantasy team during the playoffs.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=3435&key=1151&"><B>Ricky Watters</B></A>, RB SEA - McKay <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Watters left Sunday's game against Dallas in the fourth quarter with an injured right ankle.
