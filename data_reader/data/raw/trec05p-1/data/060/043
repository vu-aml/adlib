Please advise how critical it is that the Cost Estimate be split by project components, specifically:
1. San Juan Lateral - 97 mi.
2. TW Mainline Loop- 225 mi 
3. Phoenix Lateral - 135 mi
4. Panda Extension- 35 mi
5. Associated Compression

We can estimate these components for pipe(material) costs and construction costs quite easily, based on our field recon and info we have obtained from existing alignment sheets and other data.
The difficulty comes in assessing the "soft costs" - i.e. Project Managment, Engineering,Environmental,Regulatory, Construction Mangement, and to some degree ROW on a project component basis. 
If you really need on a component basis, the best we can do( and it may be misleading) is to calculate the total costs and then prorate based on lengths and/or HP..
Please advise as soon as you can.
Thanks
