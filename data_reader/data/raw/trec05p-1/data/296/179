                        MAY 2002 IMBALANCE VOLUMES

May 2002 Imbalance Volumes are now available to view on-line. They may be
viewed in ESCRIPT through the Flowing Gas/Imbalance Window. If you have any
questions, please contact me, John Lester at 304/627-3141 or Doug Barr at

                              PL- RESTRICTION

The work schedule for the pigging of the PL-1 system that was originally
scheduled for Monday, June 10, 2002, has been changed to Wednesday June 12,
2002.  This notice replaces the previous notice posted on Tuesday June 4th.
The implementation of this restriction on Wednesday means that there will
be no interruptible transportation capacity or non-PL1 transportation
capacity available along the PL-1 system.  This restriction will also
require that all deliveries at that time on the PL-1 system be made to
their primary delivery point.  All interruptible and secondary deliveries
along the PL-1 system will be reduced to zero effective for the gas day of
June 12, 2002, at 10:00 ECT (9:00 CCT).  Please give me a call if you have
any questions.
