Latest NFL Player News

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/16/01
Hasselbeck is scheduled to start the Seahawks' next game October 28 against Miami due to a groin injury suffered by Trent Dilfer on Sunday. "Matt has had a couple of weeks to watch. He's champing at the bit to prove whatever he has to prove," Head Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. We don't recommend Hasselbeck as a Fantasy starter right now, especially against the Dolphins' defense in Week Seven.

Trent Dilfer <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Up! da! ted 10/16/01
Dilfer suffered a pulled groin during Sunday's game against Denver, and he is not expected to be able to play October 28 against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. "There's more to it than just a normal groin pull. We'll just leave it at that," Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren said Monday. "He's injured, and he won't practice this week." Dilfer is probably the better Fantasy option of the two, but don't expect him to be able to help your team for the next two weeks.

Tony Richardson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1471&>, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chance Richardson could play Sunday in Arizona, according to the Kansas City Star. Richardson is battling a shoulder injury.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/! ht! tp://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/16/01
Wheatley had an MRI exam on Monday to determine the extent of the damage he sustained to his right knee Sunday in Indianapolis. The results were expected back Tuesday.

Lamar Smith <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/16/01
Smith was in a walking boot after suffering a sprained ankle during Sunday's game against the Jets, according to the Miami Herald. He should be fine for Week Seven when the Dolphins return from the bye week.

Brian Griese <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Really Rottens! Updated 10/16/01
The Broncos are unsure whether Griese will be ready for Sunday's game in San Diego, according to the Denver Post. However, An MRI Monday morning on his right shoulder revealed no structural damage and no tie to his previous shoulder surgeries. Griese is questionable for Wednesday's practice as well as Sunday's game, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte to get the start.

Rob Johnson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1033&>, QB BUF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/16/01
Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't use Johnson.

Jamal Anderson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&lea! gu! e=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1076&>, RB ATL - Really Rottens Updated 10/16/01
Anderson underwent successful surgery to repair the torn ACL in his left knee Tuesday. Anderson has already been placed on injured reserve and is out for the remainder of the 2001 season. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1109&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/16/01
Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday's game against the New York Jets despite a bruised right knee. "He really could possibly play this week," coach Mike Martz said. "We're not going to rule the possibility of him playing completely out." If Faulk is unable to go, however, Trung Canidate will be the featured back in the game. At this point, it's tough to make a decision on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the situation throug! ho! ut the week. 

Justin McCareins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=235117&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
McCareins will be sidelined six to eight weeks after breaking his ankle Sunday on a kickoff return. He is scheduled to have surgery on the ankle Wednesday to insert a pin in the joint. This is a major setback for the rookie. He started Sunday's game and had two catches for 70 yards. 

Eddie Berlin <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=235023&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Berlin, a rookie receiver used mostly on special teams, will be sidelined three to four weeks. He suffered a severely separated right shoulder on a kickoff return Sun! da! y.

Dennis Northcutt <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Browns' head coach Butch Davis told The Akron Plain-Dealer that Northcutt will get a lot of playing time this week against the Ravens. Don't expect Northcutt to be too productive, but he is a decent pickup if you need an extra wideout this week. 

Peter Warrick <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=187401&>, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Warrick is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is recovering from a bruised left shoulder.

Marco Battaglia <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?scr! ip! t=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1324&> , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Battaglia is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is suffering from a strained left shoulder. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
Grbac was feeling woozy and nursing a headache Monday, the result of the most severe concussion he's received in nine years in the NFL but he will play Sunday at Cleveland. Grbac was slammed to the ground by Santana Dotson in the second quarter of the Baltimore Ravens' 31-23 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. The quarterback stayed in the game, but threw interceptions on his next two drives and was pulled eight minutes into the fourth quarter. On Monday, Grbac declared hims! el! f fit enough to play. "I'm still a little foggy, and my wife was waking me up every few hours to see if I was alive," he said, "but I'm feeling OK and I'll be ready." 

Redskins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=30&>, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Washington cornerback Fred Smoot suffered a sprained left knee during Monday's game against Dallas. He was on crutches after sustaining the injury and is currently listed as day-to-day. 

Stephen Alexander <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Alexander suffered a sprained right ankle during Monday night's loss to Washington. He was seen using crutches on the sidelines and is listed as day-to-day. 

Duce Staley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&lea! gu! e=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/16/01
According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him Fantasy-wsie. 

Joe Jurevicius <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=12484&>, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/16/01
Jurevicius suffered a rib injury during Sunday's game against St. Louis. The injury is not considered serious, however, so expect Jurevicius to be in the starting lineup on Monday against Philadelphia. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1593&>, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons! Updated 10/16/01
Schroeder (ankle) informed Head Coach Mike Sherman that he would be available for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Sherman stated that a decision on Schroeder would not be made until later in the week, but we expect him to go. 

Joey Galloway <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Galloway suffered a sprained left ankle during Monday night's 9-7 win over Washington. The Cowboys have a bye this week, so Galloway should have amble time to recover from the injury in time for the team's next game. 

Reggie Swinton <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Swinton suffered a hamstring injury during pre-game warmups on Monday night. He left the game after the opening kickoff, and is listed as day-to-day. 

Jackie Harris <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Harris (groin) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He didn't have a reception in the game, and has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

Quincy Carter <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=235201&>, QB DAL - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Carter underwent successful surgery to repair the tendon that attaches his hamstring to his lower left leg on Monday.! H! e is expected to miss six weeks of action due to the procedure. 

Raghib Ismail <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Ismail (knee) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He finished with three catches for 50 yards, but didn't make much of an impact Fantasy-wise. 

Tiki Barber <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring any setbacks, Barber will be available for Sunday's game against Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks. 

Michael Pittman <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/http! :/! /football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Pittman suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, and was dealing with headaches on Monday as a result. He is expected to undergo tests, and is status for Sunday's game against Kansas City will be determined later in the week. If he is unable to play, Thomas Jones would step into the No. 1 RB role once again. 

Randy Moss <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Moss is dealing with a sprained right ankle, which may keep him from playing at full capacity this weekend against Green Bay. It's tough to ever bench Moss, but considering his recent struggles, it might not be a bad idea if your roster allows for a solid repl! ac! ement. 

Doug Chapman <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=187510&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Chapman is expected to get the starting nod this weekend against Green Bay due to Michael Bennett's ankle injury. Chapman may be worth picking up for the week in deeper leagues, but he'll be hard-pressed to put up good numbers against a solid Packers' defense. 

Michael Bennett <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
According to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, Bennett (ankle) is expected to miss this weekend's game against Green Bay. He was wearing a protective boot on Monday and was walkin! g ! with a noticeable limp. Doug Chapman will likely get the start in Bennett's absence.
