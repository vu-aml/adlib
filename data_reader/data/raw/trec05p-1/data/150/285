<DIV></DIV>&gt;Kelly, 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I am going to use my Auburn ticket this weekend. I am also trying to 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;find one for Kerry and an ID. Any tickets? Also, people may be calling 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;you to sell a ticket for $10. I e-mailed them off of 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Universitytools.com. Last time I used Mindy's ID which may work 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;again. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Did anybody use my Ark ticket? 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Mike 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
