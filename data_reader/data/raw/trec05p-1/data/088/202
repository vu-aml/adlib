I know nothing.   This does not even make sense to me.

Does anyone in Credit know the answer to this question, as I don't?

Tana,

There are about 20-30 deals in pending sent to legal status that are Riskmantra vs. EGM.  My question is should we even be doing trades with Enron Gas Marketing.  And if we should, can we set up an ISDA with RMT with an effective date of 9/5/01?

Thanks,

Patrick
