Reliant also is going through other neighborhoods.  

My mother lives right near Bellaire and Reliant came through and told her
that they have 7' of space in the right-of-way.  They cut down 3 of her 52
year old pine trees because they were too close to their freaking lines!!!
Those tree had never harmed anything - even through Alicia (Hurricane).
Bastards.

Subject: *EMCA* Response from Reliant - HL&P


Neartown neighbors,

The attachment is a response to my information request concerning Reliant -
HL&P's installation of the big poles. Conversations after my letter's
receipt moved in the direction of possible community meetings where R-H
would explain what they were doing and answer our many questions.

Last Tuesday R-H informed me that since the installation project would be
completed by the end of this month, that the attachment would be sufficient
for their communication purposes. A meeting with us was not necessary.

The R-H spokesperson readily admitted that there had been no attempts to
obtain community imput/feedback prior the new pole installation.

I'm disappointed and frustrated. I need your thoughts on how to proceed.

Read the attachment and tell me what you think should happen next.

Thanks
