MR KENNETH KANOUTE
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT
CREDIT BANK BENIN
COTONOU-BENIN REPUBLIC
WEST AFRICA.
TEL +229 88 98 16

MY DEAR ,

I am Mr Kenneth Kanoute the director in charge of auditing and accounting=

section of Credit Bank Benin republic in West Africa with due respect and=

regard. I have decided to contact you  on a business transaction that wil=
l
be very beneficial to both of us at  the end of the transaction.

During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came ac=
ross
a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on 30th
january 2000 on Kenya Airways with  aircraft Airbus 310-304 at location
Abidjan, Ivory Coast, with registration  number 5Y-BEN while travelling
with his entire family, his wife, two children and a maid on a festive vi=
sit
to Abidjan and since his untimely death the  funds has been dormant in hi=
s
account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody eithe=
r
from his family or relation before our  discovery to this development.

Although personally, I kept this information secret within myself and par=
tners
to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during th=
e
time of execution. The said amount was USD$24.1M (twenty four Million one=

Hundred Thousand united states dollars).

As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through=

my good friend who works with chamber of commerce on foreign business rel=
ations
here in Cotonou-Benin, it is him who recommended your person to me to be
viable and capable to champion  a business of such magnitude without any
problem.

Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bo=
nafide
next of kin to the deceased and get the required approval and transfer th=
is
money to a foreign account has been put in place, all directives and need=
ed
information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest
and willingness to assist us and also benefit yourself to this great busi=
ness
opportunity.

In fact i could have done this deal alone but because of my position in
this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed  to operate a foreign=

account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time=

of transfer because i work in this bank.

This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow wh=
o
will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a for=
eign
account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his req=
uest
as it may be after due verification and clarification by the corresponden=
t
branch of the bank  where the whole money will be remitted from to your
own designated bank  account.

May i at this point emphasize that this transaction is100% risk free as
i have made all arrangements for a successful transaction as an insider
of the bank before contacting you.On smooth conclusion of this transactio=
n,
you will beentitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification,while 10% wi=
ll
be set aside to take care of any expenses that may arise during the time
of transfer like telephone bills, fax and our travel tickets to come over=

to your country for the sharing of the fund while 60% will be for me and
my partners.

Please you have been advised to keep this a top secretas we are still in
service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal wit=
h
you.

I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you conf=
irm
the money in your account and ask us to come down to your  country for su=
bsequent
sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and fur=
ther
investment either in your country or any country you will advice us to in=
vest
in.

All other necessary information will be sent to you on your acceptance to=

champion this transaction with me.
 
Yours Faithfully,
Mr Kenneth Kanoute.
