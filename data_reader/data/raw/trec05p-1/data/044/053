Thanks for the quick response. Let's hook up early next week to discuss a plan of attack on DWR.  Enjoy your days off.

Barry:

Good to meet you last week.  I'm out of the office until Monday, but will get on this as soon as I return.  Of this group, Dynegy is involved in the State Senate's investigation.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff, further to our conversation... this is the list of companies that have entered into contractual agreements with the DWR. I don't know if this means they have transaction but perhaps between Kim Ward and yourself, you can advise.

What I need to know is the legal status/issues ( if any ) of any of the companies listed here today as it relates to the state of California. 
Pan Canadian Energy Services, Occidental Energy Marketing, Dynegy Marketing and Trading , Texaco Natural Gas, BP Amoco, and Coast Energy Group. 

Can you advise If any of these companies form part of ongoing legal action against the state?

Once I know this, then we can decide on a plan what we should discuss with Mark Baldwin.

Thanks in advance.
