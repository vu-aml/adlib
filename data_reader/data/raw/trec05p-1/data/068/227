Hi. I love you. I'm going downstairs to work out (if I remember how to get there) in a few minutes. Did you see the stock price? I knew it would happen!!! It looks like we can probably stay at either the Mirage (a suite with a jacuzzi tub) or at the Venetian(a regular room) for about the same price. Take your pick. See you later sweetie. I will not eat lunch but just get a smoothie. By babe.
