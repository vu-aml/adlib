> Bill,
>
> Attached, please find the Final version of the Enron-AHC ISDA Schedule and
> the Credit Support Annex for execution by Enron.
>
> All the terms of the Schedule have been agreed to and we ask that you
> print two copies, execute and express mail to my attention.  The Credit
> Support Annex was sent to Enron last week and reviewed by Enron with the
> only comment "Seems too conservative.  I will call to discuss." regarding
