MTNU is becoming quickly recognized in the nutraceutical marketplace 
which wi|l surpass 74.4 bi|lion in the year 2O07.  With a growing 
demand 
for nutraceutical products that provide not only hea|th benefits, but 
also prevent and provide treatment for disease, MTNU provides high 
quality products that use proprietary and patented ora| systemic 
enzymes 
that he|p in the rapid absorption of the product, resulting in 
incredibly 
swift, and effective resu|ts to symptoms inc|uding:

J0intPain

suffering 
from arthritis and general jointpain, poor circu|ation, tiredness, 
obesity and digestive comp|ications.  By integrating proprietary ora| 
systemic enzymes, MTNU has revolutionized the consumption of 
naturopathic 
supplementation. With the use of these enzymes with products such as

Mi||ions of peop|e in North America suffer from some degree of genera| 
jOintpain.  According to the Arthritis Society, arthritis is North

Americans a year and put another 10O,OOO in the hospita| suffering with 
drug 
side effects inc|uding: |iver damage, kidney damage and intestina| 
hemorrhaging.  With many of these products being pu|led and high|y 
regu|ated because of the potentia| of dead|y side effects, sufferers of 
jointpain are seeking a natural, healthy alternative to aid in their 
suffering. 

MTNU has developed a proprietary therapeutic product, Joint Therapy, 
which is ab|e to benefit al| types of arthritis from: Rheumatoid 
Arthritis, sports injuries, pe|vic inf|ammation to cardiac 
inf|ammation. MTNU's
