Latest NFL Player News

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/13/01
After missing most of Thursday's practice with a sore throwing shoulder,
Griese was a full participant in Friday's workout and was expected to start
on Sunday in Seattle. The Broncos added Griese to their injury report
Friday morning, listing him as questionable. An hour later, however, Griese
had no obvious discomfort during a 75-minute workout. Coach Mike Shanahan
said he was confident that, barring any setbacks, Griese will play against
the Seahawks. 

Kordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 10/12/01
Don't expect Stewart to help your Fantasy team this week. The Steelers had
success running the ball last week, using a two-pronged attack, and will
stick to that strategy. Besides, Stewart won't be too effective when he
finally does throw the ball. He hasn't thrown a touchdown pass in three
games this season. 

Troy Edwards, WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Edwards will catch a few passes this week but he won't be productive enough
to help a Fantasy team. The Steelers will run the ball for most of the
game. 

Amos Zereoue, RB PIT - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Amos might become famous soon enough if he continues to run like he did
last week. Look for him to continue to run well this week against the
Chiefs and score a touchdown. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/12/01
Burress' struggles will continue again this week, but it won't be solely
because of his effort. The Steelers will implement a strict running game.
They were extremely successful running the ball last week. Also, Burress
won't get open enough to be productive.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/12/01
Dunn tested his sprained right foot in practice Friday and could return to
Tampa Bay's lineup against the Tennessee Titans. His status for this week
was upgraded from questionable to probable Friday, though a decision on
whether he will play won't be made until Sunday. If he is cleared to play,
Dunn expects to assume his normal workload. But he is a risky Fantasy start
because of his uncertain condition. Dunn won't put up good numbers if he is
less than 100 percent. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/12/01
Griese is now listed as questionable for Week Five with a sore shoulder,
but he is expected to play against the Seahawks. He was able to practice
without any apparent problems on Friday.

Bobby Engram, WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Engram has developed a good on-field relationship with Trent Dilfer. He
might post solid numbers for the second consecutive week.

Darrell Jackson, WR SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Jackson has started to fade away as a Fantasy receiver. If Bobby Engram
continues to play well. Jackson will get less looks from the Seattle QBs.

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Dilfer will start for the second consecutive week. Expect him to throw at
least one TD pass against Denver, but the Seahawks will lean heavily on the
run against the Broncos.

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
Alexander is definitely a good start this week. He should score at least
one TD against the questionable Denver defense.

Koren Robinson, WR SEA - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Robinson should get more opportunities to catch the ball when Trent Dilfer
is playing. But he has yet to prove he can put up quality Fantasy numbers.

Charlie Garner, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 10/12/01
Garner might be a major offensive factor this week. The Colts are soft
against the run, and Tyrone Wheatley is questionable with a wrist injury.
Garner might be asked to carry the ball often against the weak Indianapolis
run defense.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/12/01
Wheatley is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against with a wrist
injury. Charlie Garner will get the majority of the carries if Wheatley is
not ready to play against the Colts.

Jerry Rice, WR OAK - Team Chick Updated 10/12/01
Rice should have another good outing. He should draw inexperienced
Indianapolis CB David Macklin in coverage, which means Rice will definitely
be a TD threat again this week.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 10/12/01
Gannon should have a fine game against the Colts. Indianapolis will have a
lot of trouble handling wideouts Tim Brown and Jerry Rice.

Freddie Jones, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/12/01
Jones has been a disappointment so far this year. Don't count on good
numbers from him this week, because the Chargers will feature the run
against New England.

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 10/12/01
Graham might be a good start against New England. He should be able to get
open often against CB Otis Smith.

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 10/12/01
Conway is a risky start this week. The Chargers will feature their ground
game against New England, and CB Ty Law won't let Conway stray too far from
his view.

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 10/12/01
The Patriots seem like a soft opponent, but don't expect Flutie to post
super totals. The Chargers will depend on the run to spur them to victory.

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/12/01
Consider Clark as a starter this week. The Seahawks are soft over the
middle and in the red zone, where Clark can be effective.

Dwayne Carswell, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Carswell is a good start this week. Seattle's defense has always been
vulnerable to tight ends over the middle.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 10/12/01
Smith's yardage numbers might be a bit disappointing this week if Seattle
CB Shawn Springs (hamstring, probable) is close to top form. But he should
still catch at least one TD pass as the Seahawks hurt their secondary with
the lack of a solid pass rush.

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/12/01
Expect excellent numbers from Anderson this week. He always plays well
against Seattle, and the Seahawks still lack the talent to stop him from
gaining big chunks of yardage as the game wears on.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/12/01
Griese should be good for at least two TD passes against the Seahawks. He
should have a lot of time to throw against the weak Seattle pass rush.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
Minnis might be asked to be Kansas City's No. 1 receiver this week, because
Derrick Alexander is expected to sit out with a back injury. That is a
major task for a rookie receiver. Facing the physical Pittsburgh defense
will limit Minnis' output, and he is a risky start.

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Gonzalez might a major factor in Kansas City's passing game this week.
Trent Green will struggle to find open wideouts, and will look to Gonzalez
to help him move the ball on important downs.

Jermaine Wiggins, TE NE - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Wiggins has done very little to improve his Fantasy value this season. He's
not worth a roster spot at this point, so release him if you took a chance
on him early in the season. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
Don't expect great numbers from Holmes this week. Pittsburgh has been tough
against the run, and has the speed at LB to contain him on the outside.

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Alexander practiced on Thursday, but he is still being bothered by back
problems. If he is able to play against Pittsburgh, he will be very
limited.

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Patten now moves in the starting lineup as New England's No. 2 wideout due
to the release of Bert Emanuel. It will be a short-lived stint, however,
because Terry Glenn is expected to return to the team soon. As a result,
Patten isn't worth much more than a reserve spot Fantasy-wise. 

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/12/01
Green might have another bad week. Pittsburgh's defense will pressure him
often, and the Chiefs will be less effective in the air without the injured
Derrick Alexander.

Tom Brady, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Brady's numbers have been anything but impressive in Drew Bledsoe's
absence. He isn't really worthy of Fantasy consideration, so don't pick him
up for your roster. 

Ken Dilger, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Dilger might be a minor factor in the passing game against Oakland. He
should get more looks this week, because the Colts have been hit hard by
injuries at wide receiver.

Phil Dawson, K CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Look for Dawson to connect on a few field goals this week. The Browns will
have trouble capitalizing inside the red zone but Dawson will help them
score with accurate kicking. 

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 10/12/01
Look for Kitna to complete a fair amount of passes this week and score at
least one touchdown. The Browns defense will be tough, but Kitna will find
a way to get at least one score. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Head Coach Bill Belichick has given Glenn a 50-50 chance of playing on
Sunday against San Diego. However, the veteran wideout is not worth
starting from a Fantasy perspective this week. 

Marcus Pollard, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Pollard should find himself in a position to score this week. Indianapolis
should move the ball consistently in the air against Oakland.

J.R. Redmond, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/12/01
Redmond is questionable for Sunday's game against San Diego due to an ankle
injury. He probably will miss this game due to the injury, which makes him
virtually worthless Fantasy-wise. 

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Harrison should be able to get past the 100-yard receiving mark against the
Raiders. Oakland's secondary sometimes gives up big plays to the league's
better speed receivers.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Look for Dillon to have mixed success this week. The Browns defense will
make it difficult to run but his effort as a receiver will be enough to
give him a productive week. 

Edgerrin James, RB IND - President Taft Updated 10/12/01
James' rushing yardage numbers might not be stellar against Oakland. But
the Colts will put him in position to score more than once.

Peyton Manning, QB IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Manning should throw at least two TD passes against Oakland. The Raiders'
secondary runs hot and cold, and sometimes has trouble with marquee
quarterbacks.

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/12/01
Warrick is suffering from a leg injury but is expected to play this week.
He won't be too productive. Warrick only has 18 catches in four games and
has scored just once. 

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Scott won't be too productive this week. He only averages four catches a
game and hasn't scored a touchdown. Rookie Chad Johnson might cut into his
playing time. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Carter needs surgery to repair his torn hamstring and will be lost for up
to eight weeks. Anthony Wright will start in Carter's place, but neither QB
has much Fantasy value at this point. 

Mike Vanderjagt, K IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Vanderjagt (toe) kicked in practice on Thursday. He is expected to play
against the Raiders.

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
As has been the popular theme in Baltimore, Grbac will throw the ball a lot
this week. He won't be too accurate but will connect for at least one
touchdown pass. 

Brandon Stokley, WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Stokley won't be productive this week. He has had problems getting open.
That is part of the reason why he lost his starting job. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Sharpe will be very effective in a hard-fought game against the Packers
this week. He will catch a lot of passes and most likely score on a short
pass. 

Curtis Martin, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Martin should register at least one TD against the Dolphins. The Jets are
not intimidated by Miami's defense, and will put their star RB in position
to score inside the red zone.

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/12/01
Taylor will have another solid game this week. Expect him to catch several
passes and use his height to snag a touchdown pass or two. 

Vinny Testaverde, QB NYJ - Uran Man Updated 10/12/01
Testaverde is a risky start this week. While he might throw more than one
TD pass, he also might turn the ball over more than once against Miami.

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Don't expect Allen to get a lot of yards this week. However, he might score
a touchdown. The Ravens have been getting him a lot of carries once they
get close to the goal line. 

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/12/01
Ismail will catch several passes this week but don't expect him to score.
The Ravens will spread the ball around a lot in their passing attack and
will look to Shannon Sharpe and Travis Taylor once they get inside the red
zone. 

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 10/12/01
McKnight will definitely be a TD threat this week. He should be able to get
loose for some long gains.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 10/12/01
Gadsden should find himself in position to catch a TD pass against the
Jets. Miami will score often against the New York defense.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/12/01
Look for Wycheck to catch a lot of passes this week. He hasn't had a lot of
looks because he has been used mostly as a fullback, blocking for Eddie
George. But George is suffering from an ankle injury and isn't expected to
get a lot of carries. The Titans will throw to Wycheck to compensate. 

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Smith should have a super day against the Jets. New York hasn't stopped
anyone on the ground, and Smith has run over everyone he has faced so far.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/12/01
The Titans normally implement a strict running game in their offense. But
with RB Eddie George suffering from an ankle injury they will throw the
ball a lot on Sunday. McNair will be able to move the chains using short
passes but he won't beat anyone deep. He has had troubles throwing the deep
ball and will face a lot of pressure from the Tampa pass rush. He will
connect on short passes, but is more apt to run for a touchdown. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
Bennett was held in check once again last Sunday, posting only 36 yards of
total offense against New Orleans. He may be worth starting in deeper
leagues against Detroit, however, but we'd avoid him if at all possible. 

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Fiedler should have a good week against the Jets. New York's pass defense
will surrender at least two TDs if it cannot effectively pressure the Miami
QB.

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Dyson will get a lot of passes thrown his way this week. Although fellow
wideout Derrick Mason is suffering from injuries starting RB Eddie George
is also injured. Look for Tennessee to through the ball a lot. Dyson will
catch a fair amount of these passes but don't expect him to score. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/12/01
Culpepper could have his best game of the season on Sunday against Detroit.
He's far too valuable to ever place on reserve, so start him with
confidence this week. 

Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Uran Man Updated 10/12/01
Sanders will start Sunday's game if injured receiver Derrick Mason is
unable to play, but don't expect him to be too productive. He lacks the
separation speed to distance himself from the secondary and QB Steve McNair
has had trouble throwing the ball downfield this season.

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/12/01
Carter has struggled, but he's too good not to start on a weekly basis.
Look for him to find the end zone against Detroit on Sunday. 

Byron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 10/12/01
Chamberlain has quickly become one of the key weapons in the Vikings'
passing game, and he is a reliable weekly Fantasy starter. Expect another
good outing this weekend against Detroit. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/12/01
Moss has underachieved thus far, but he'll put up a huge game against
Detroit. The Lions can't seem to stop anyone on defense, so Moss should
have a big day. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/12/01
George remains questionable for Sunday's game against Tampa Bay because of
a sprained ankle and will likely be a gametime decision. He missed practice
once again on Thursday. Head coach Jeff Fisher said earlier this week that
George would be a gametime decision if he didn't practice on Thursday or
Friday. He is expected to get a lesser amount of carries even if he does
play. Skip Hicks and Mike Green will get more attempts to lessen George's
load. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 10/12/01
Williams put up a huge performance against Minnesota last Sunday despite a
shoulder injury. He's a must-start against Carolina, especially after his
solid performance last week. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 10/12/01
Horn is a must-start this weekend against Carolina. The Panthers' secondary
is very vulnerable, and Horn has put up good numbers against them in the
past. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Mason missed practice once again on Thursday because of ankle and shoulder
injuries. He remains questionable for Sunday's game. Kevin Dyson and Chris
Sanders will be the starting receivers if Mason is inactive. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/12/01
Coles (knee) is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Jets.
Matthew Hatchette would likely start if Coles cannot play.

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Cleeland is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Carolina with
a hamstring injury. He is expected to play, however, but Fantasy owners may
want to consider benching him. He hasn't done much from a Fantasy
perspective, and doesn't seem to be as involved in New Orleans' offense
this season. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Westbrook (hip) is listed as probable for Monday's game against Dallas. He
could finally have a decent game against the Cowboys, but we don't advise
starting him outside of larger leagues. 

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Alexander continues to be a disappointment to Fantasy owners. He's only
good for one or two receptions per game, and his yardage totals are always
minimal. He's not worth starting this week Dallas, and may be better off
left on the waiver wire. 

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Dallas secondary on
Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in
larger leagues. 

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 10/12/01
Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Giants
secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your
starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Heap remains questionable for Sunday's game because of an ankle injury.
Don't bother adding him to your active roster this week. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 10/12/01
Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to
ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against CB Jason
Sehorn and the questionable N.Y. Giants secondary. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/12/01
Faulk will have another big game this weekend, despite facing a tough N.Y.
Giants defense. He's the top Fantasy player in the league and a must-start
every week. 

Ernie Conwell, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Conwell (concussion) is probable for Sunday's game against the New York
Giants. He's been a reliable option for Fantasy owners and is worth
starting against the G-Men. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/12/01
Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a
a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York
Giants on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup. 

Nick Goings, RB CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Goings seems to have slipped to No. 3 on the running back depth chart in
Carolina. He won't see much playing time against New Orleans, so don't
bother using him. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
Weinke may find life tough against a solid New Orleans defense on Sunday.
He's worth considering in larger leagues, but we wouldn't advise starting
him if at all possible. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 10/12/01
Hayes is listed as probable for Sunday's game against New Orleans due to an
ankle injury. He'll likely be in the starting lineup, however, but it'll be
tough to post solid numbers against the Saints. He's worth considering in
larger leagues only. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 10/12/01
Walls is proving that he is still one of the best tight ends in the league
Fantasy-wise. Unless you have a better option, Walls is a must-start
against New Orleans. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Muhammad faces a tough New Orleans secondary this weekend, but he's still
too good to consider benching outside of smaller leagues. He is also one of
the more consistent receivers in the league, and should be in your starting
lineup on a weekly basis. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Jeffers (knee) could see some action in Sunday's game against New Orleans.
However, he isn't worth starting Fantasy-wise. 

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Huntley will backup Tshimanga Biakabutuka in this weekend's game against
New Orleans. He'll split carries at best, and isn't worth starting
Fantasy-wise. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Biakabutuka is expected to get the start this weekend against New Orleans.
However, we'd advise reserving him if your roster allows you to play a back
with a better matchup. 

Dorsey Levens, RB GB - President Taft Updated 10/12/01
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no
real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

Ahman Green, RB GB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Green has been one of the best backs in the league thus far, but he could
struggle against Baltimore's vaulted defense. If you have a deep group of
running backs, you may want to consider reserving the Packers' tailback. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/12/01
You might want to consider benching Favre against the ferocious Baltimore
defense this week. He's been great thus far, but if there's ever a game
where he might struggle, it's this contest against the Ravens. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Schroeder has been great for Fantasy owners thus far, but he'll take a step
back against Baltimore. If you can afford to reserve him, it might be a
good idea to do exactly that. 

Herman Moore, WR DET - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Moore has done nothing so far, and we don't expect him to be a reliable
Fantasy player this season. Unless you're desperate, we'd recommend
benching or releasing him. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Stewart may not post huge rushing numbers against Minnesota, but he's still
worth starting Fantasy-wise. His numbers are being hampered by Detroit's
struggling offense, but it's tough to bench him considering the lack of
quality backs in the league. 

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/12/01
Crowell had a decent outing against St. Louis, but he's still not reliable
enough to consider as an everyday starter. Unless you play in deeper
league, we'd advise benching Crowell this week. 

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 10/12/01
Morton has developed into the Lions' No. 1 receiver this season, and is
worth taking a chance on against Minnesota's mediocre secondary. If you pay
in a deeper league and don't have more reliable options, Morton is
definittly worth considering this week. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Collins has struggled the past few weeks, but he has the chance to be very
productive against St. Louis this weekend. The Giants could fall behind
early, so Collins might be asked to throw the ball 30-plus times in the
