Sorry for the late reply...you may already have your answer...

PacifiCorp Power Marketing, Inc.  This is the entity they use for Physical.  I do not see that they trade any Finanical Power.  They have done Nat. Gas financial Swaps with ECC.

Sara,
See attached spreadsheet which shows the legal entity names by counterparty for each commodity.  Name differences between the commodities are highlighted in Blue.

Kim:

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

Thanks.
