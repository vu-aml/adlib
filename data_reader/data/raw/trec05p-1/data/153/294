Gerald,

I'm ok with the draft except I would like to see some language for tracking costs, at least on an aggregate basis so we can assess the risk as the project develops.  I believe that our risk is near zero if the project is going to come in for less than $5.5 MM overall.  I would hope that Gulf Power is appropriately incentivized to manage their way towards a less than $5.5 MM number as they may ultimately lose it back to the commission in lower rates.  Push this and any other comments back to Jeff and let's get this closed up for signature tomorrow morning.

Thanks,
Chris Hilgert
