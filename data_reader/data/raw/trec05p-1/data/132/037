THIS IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL

>On her

> > "Oh yes, daddy. You know that I love you."

> > "That's okay, Honey, daddy loves you. Good night."

> >
> > "That's okay. Sleep well. God bless you, little

> > loves you." And as always, he brushed her cheek
>with a gentle kiss.
> >
> > A few nights later when her daddy came in, Jenny

> >
> > "What is it, Jenny? What's the matter?"
> >
> > Jenny didn't say anything but lifted her little
>hand up to her

>"Here, daddy,
