Dear Sir/Madam,


I am Dr.Mark Kuku,a manager in the Bills and Exchange at the Foreign 
Remittance Department of the
ECO INTERNATIONAL BANK I am writing this letter to ask for your support and 
cooperation to carry out this business opportunity in my department. We 
discovered an abandoned sum of$15,000,000.00 (Fifteen million United States 
Dollars only) in an account that belongs
to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family of a 
wife and two children in
November 1997 in a Plane crash.Since we heard of his death, we have been 
expecting his next-of-kin to come over and put claims for his money as the 
heir,because we cannot release the fund from his account unless someone 
applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our 
banking guidelines.


Unfortunately, neither their family member nor distant relative has 
everappeared to claim the said fund. Upon this discovery, I and other 
officials in my department have agreed to make business with you and 
relea!se the total amount into your account as the heir of the fund since no 
one came for it or discovered he maintained  account with our bank,otherwise 
the fund will be returned to the banks treasury as unclaimed fund.

We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus;20 % for you 
as foreign partner,75 % for us the officials in my department and 5 % for 
the settlement of all local and foreign expences incurred by us and you 
during the course of this business.Upon the successful completion of
this transfer, I and one of my colleagues will come to your country and mind 
our share. It is from our 75 % we intend to import Agricultural Machineries 
into my country as a way of recycling the fund.

To commence this transaction,we require you to immediately indicate your 
interest by a return e-mail and enclose your private contact telephone 
number,fax number full name and address and
your designated bank coordinates to enable us file letter of claim to the 
appropriate departments for
necessary approvals before the transfer can be made.

Note also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL because of
its nature.I look forward to receiving your prompt response .

Regards,
Dr.Mark Kuku.
