Mark,
 
I wanted to let you know that today will be my last day at Enron. Please remove me from all the boards.
 
I have really enjoyed working with you and my time at Enron. I still can't believe all that has happened.  Best of luck to you and your family and I hope we get a chance to work together again someday.
 
Sincerely,
Mike
