Mark,

Thanks so much for your kind hospitality.  Please thank Alicia again for me.  
How did Lauren's play go last night?  I am getting more excited about a move 
away from Houston, especially to Denver.  I hope you and your family have a 
great trip and please do give us a call if you swing into Houston.  Talk to 
you soon.

Kind regards,

-Larry-
