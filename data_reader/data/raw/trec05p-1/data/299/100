News: PHILADELPHIA, Jul 12, 2005 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Northeast Development Corp., (Pink Sheets: NHVP), announced today that as a further step in the acquisition of a laser engraving and rringking facility in Central Europe a preliminary agreement has been reached for a joint venture laser rringking plant based in Switzerland. 

This completely new facility will include both design and rringketing functions to provide fully independent operation as well as development of new rringket segments. 

Northeast Development Corp. and their counterparts in this agreement are confident that a Swiss based, independent and highly qualified operation will satisfy the demands of a highly developed and quality conscious Swiss industry. Specialised rringkets can be developed in situ with the close cooperation of industry clients. Direct access by the client to a skilled local specialist, as this joint venture is designed to be, will ensure long-term and loyal clientele since the client base will be mainly within small and medium sized, often family controlled businesses, which still make up a major part of the Swiss industrial environment.
