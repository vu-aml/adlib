Greetings from your Member Relations Director
I hope everyone had as great a weekend as I did.  My dad was visiting from
Oklahoma, so I got to do many of the tourist things that I haven't gotten
around to doing since my move here last August.  Because my dad was a
military man, he always enjoys visiting the local memorials and museums.
It's always a treat having my own personal guide, and not many people have
such extensive knowledge of airplanes, ships, history and of course,
personal stories.  We toured the Flight Museum in Galveston, The USS Texas
in LaPorte and then, as the grand finale, we saw "We Were Soldiers".  If
you haven't seen this movie yet, you must go.  It was incredible.

Have a wonderful week!

See you at the Club,
Jennifer K. Mangini
