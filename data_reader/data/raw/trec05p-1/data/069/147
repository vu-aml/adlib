Black dot is what I would need.  The two concerns I have is shaft flex (I would actually prefer steel shafts) and the price (I'm broke).  I appreciate your willingness to work with me but even though your price is fair, I simply can't afford it.  Let me know how much you would be willing to come off but I have to warn you even if you ask $600 it would be hard for me to come up with.
Thanks again for keeping me in mind.
Drew

The Ping I-3's are black dot.  New Ping I-3's with steel shafts are $699.00 and used Ping I-3's are $500.00 - $550.00.  If you have any interest at all I would be willing to work with you on price and/or payment terms.

Thanks for the heads up.  Are they black dot?  Even if they are, I much prefer steel shaft's (mainly because I'm poor).  Thanks for offer and keep me in the loop for other ping I-3 or Callaway X-14

Andrew,

Ping I-3 oversize, graphite shaft, reqular flex.  The regular flex in Ping graphite shafts are pretty firm.  I have 3 thru pw, all in excellent condition.  If you have any interest we can talk about the price but my first inclination is that the price would be similar to the price for a new set of Ping I-3 oversize steel shaft (approx $700).

Richard

Andrew,

Did you purchase any new golf clubs yet?  I may have something that you are interested in.  Let me know.

Richard
