Can you hold on this until after mid-week this week?  We haven't gotten much communication from "above" on spending, but everyone is doing the obvious things to be prudent right now.  I can tell you that even over this Thanksgiving weekend (with banks open on Friday), that there is still tremendous concern and focus on cash.  (I got calls at home on Friday afternoon to provide data on EA, EGM and EIM payables - data deemed critical that day).  I know that company-wide, we will want to be certain that the cancellation of the company-wide holiday party does not result in just as much money being spent by hundreds of groups across the company.  

If  waiting until after mid-week makes the timing diffcult for planning purposes, I might suggest a less costly version.  One idea is to tell your directs that you want to bring them together as a group to thank them for their hard work and offer your home for the occassion on the 7th.  You could submit for expense reimbursement the cost of something like wine and beer, and ask everyone to bring a snack to contribute to the party.  I think that everyone would understand not having the entire event underwritten by Enron - especially following the events that will occur  this week.  Over the years we have all gotten used to Enron footing the bill for so many things.  At the bank where I was before, we occassionally had get-togethers where we all brought something to the party.  It is not really unusual outside Enron.  --Sally

I have been sort of waiting to talk to you about having a small event for my direct reports to thank them for their efforts until things cooled down at the company overall, but -- I don't see that happening any time soon.

We have not really done anything at all this year, and I wanted to do an event similar to the one you had last summer for us.  They have worked so hard and we can't ever all get away from the office at the same time  -- even to have a lunch.

Was thinking about having them over to my house for drinks and then out to eat at a restraunt.  For my direct reports and spouses.  Will include both Global Services and EES.  Was thinking of Friday night after work Dec 7th.  Need to get planning if I get the go ahead.

I have a reasonably priced italian restraunt in mind, and it would be about 20 people.   Are you ok with that? And if so, would you and David want to come too?

Let me know your thoughts

Beth
