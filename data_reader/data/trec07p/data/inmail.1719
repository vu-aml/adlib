WH BARELY ACKNOWLEDGES ANNIVERSARY OF FALL OF SADDAM: As Iraq observed the fourth anniversary of the fall of Saddam
Hussein yesterday, the lead item on the White House Web site, under the heading "LATEST NEWS," was a photograph of
Clifford the Big Red Dog at the annual Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn. "There were many children's characters in
attendance including Charlie Brown, Bugs Bunny, Arthur, and Curious George," said the caption under the photo, which
alternated with a shot of Laura Bush and two Easter bunnies on the Truman Balcony and a painting of one of President
Bush's Scottish terriers with a fiddle-playing butterfly. The president marked the anniversary by going to Arizona to
give a speech -- about immigration. In his 24-minute address, he didn't so much as mention Iraq. The vice president,
secretary of state and secretary of defense had no public events on their schedules yesterday. Washington Post: The
White House Commemorates a Very Special Day
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/09/AR2007040901263.html

BUSH CITES "AMAZING PROGRESS" ON CURBING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION: President Bush said Monday that tougher enforcement and a
new fence at the Mexican border had sharply reduced the influx of illegal immigrants, and he pressed Congress to pass a
sweeping revision of the nation's immigration laws. "It's amazing progress that's been made," Mr. Bush said on a return
visit to a section of the border that he inspected 11 months ago. In the last six months, the White House said, Border
Patrol reports showed that apprehensions of illegal immigrants along the Mexican border fell by 30 percent, to 418,184,
from 594,142 in the comparable period a year earlier. In the Yuma sector, which spans parts of Arizona and California,
apprehensions fell by 68 percent, to 25,217, from 79,131 in the comparable period a year earlier. New York Times: Bush
Ties Drop in Illegal Immigration to His Policies http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/10/washington/10bush.html

"DOUBLE DUTY" D.C. ASSIGNMENTS TAKE U.S. ATTORNEYS AWAY FROM DISTRICTS: A half-dozen sitting U.S. attorneys also serve
as aides to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales or are assigned other Washington postings, performing tasks that take
them away from regular duties in their districts for months or even years at a time, according to officials and
department records. Acting Associate Attorney General William W. Mercer, for example, has been effectively absent from
his job as U.S. attorney in Montana for nearly two years -- prompting the chief federal judge in Billings to demand his
removal and call Mercer's office "a mess." ... The number of U.S. attorneys pulling double duty in Washington is the
focus of growing concern from other prosecutors and from members of the federal bench, according to legal experts and
government officials. Washington Post: Six U.S. Attorneys Given 2nd Posting in Washington
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/09/AR2007040901227.html

CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL AT HIGHEST LEVEL IN A YEAR: Public approval for Congress is at its highest level in a year as
Democrats mark 100 days in power and step up their confrontation with President Bush over his handling of the Iraq War,
the issue that overshadows all others... The findings from an AP-Ipsos nationwide poll provide a snapshot of public
sentiment in the days after the House and Senate triggered a series of veto threats from the president by passing
separate bills that provide funds for the war, yet also call for the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops. Overall approval
for Congress is 40 percent. The survey shows Bush's approval ratings remain in the mid-30 percent range, that a
striking 39 percent strongly disapproves his handling of foreign policy and the war on terror, and that the public has
scant hopes that the president and Congress can work together to solve the country's problems. AP via Yahoo! News: AP
Poll: Congress approval up http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070410/ap_on_go_co/congress100_days

"ZERO AND SEVEN IN '07": It's a familiar scenario for Harry Reid: a united minority party using the rules of the U.S.
Senate to thwart action by the majority. As the minority leader in the previous Congress, the Nevada Democrat
effectively blocked Republicans on issues from creating private Social Security accounts to permanently repealing the
estate tax. As the Senate returns from the Easter recess, Reid, now the leader of a majority, confronts an energetic
Republican opposition that threatens to sink his plans. Republicans are gloating because Democrats haven't managed to
get final congressional approval for any of the initiatives the party set as first-round legislative goals this year.
"They are zero and seven in '07," said Mississippi's Trent Lott, the Senate's second-ranking Republican. "They have
achieved nothing." Bloomberg: Reid Hitting Roadblocks on Democrats' Agenda as Senators Return

SENATORS ASK DOJ FOR MORE DOCS ON FIRINGS: Four senators said Monday that they suspected that the Justice Department
had failed to turn over all relevant documents related to the dismissals of eight United States attorneys. The
department has released more than 3,000 pages of e-mail messages and other files. But, the senators wrote in a letter
to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, "We are concerned that additional documents relevant to the committee's
investigations are missing or have been withheld." The letter expressed skepticism about whether lawmakers had all the
material they needed to evaluate the motives for the removals and raised questions on the scope and methods used to
assemble the material. A spokesman for the department, Brian Roehrkasse, said officials would not comment until they
had reviewed the letter. New York Times: Senators Press for More Files on Removing Prosecutors
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/10/washington/10attorneys.html

SHOULD CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST RULES APPLY AT STAFF LEVEL? While House and Senate lawmakers agreed in February to new
rules requiring them to notify the public of any conflicts of interest they may have in pushing for earmarks to
legislation, there remain no such guidelines for disclosure by another category of public servants - Congressional
aides. Though in recent years significant attention has been paid to the lobbyist relatives of lawmakers - including
the sons of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and former Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) - little public
scrutiny has been paid to similar situations at the staff level. Neither chamber has established rules to address
financial or personal conflicts of interest staffers may have in working on earmarks, and watchdog groups fear that
absence represents a major loophole in Congressional ethics guidelines. Roll Call: Aides Escape Conflict Rules

REDUCED SENTENCE FOR ABRAMOFF? Disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff may be getting out of jail earlier than he expected,
NBC News learned on Monday. A federal judge Monday granted the government's request for a new hearing to determine an
appropriate reduction in Abramoff's sentence, a reward based on his continued cooperation with investigators in several
federal probes. Abramoff is currently serving a five-and-a-half-year sentence for his conviction in the Florida-based
SunCruz Casinos gambling boat fraud case. In Miami, U.S. District Judge Paul Huck granted the request from prosecutors
once they told him Abramoff's cooperation in the investigations is fully completed. NBC News: Abramoff could get
reduced sentence http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18029493/

KERRY "TAKING A PAGE" FROM THE GORE PLAYBOOK: Sen. John Kerry isn't running for president, but he's assumed the vocal
and visible roles of campaign fundraiser, Iraq critic, political author and, now, global warming expert. The
Massachusetts Democrat has inserted himself into every issue on Capitol Hill -- from conditions at veterans' hospitals
to Major League Baseball -- keeping his public profile as prominent as it was during his failed 2004 White House bid.
"Hopefully, now I have a chance to talk about these things and people know it's coming from my heart and my gut, not
from a political strategy," Mr. Kerry said Sunday on ABC's "This Week." The senator appeared with his wife, Teresa
Heinz Kerry, as the two touted their new book, "This Moment on Earth: Today's New Environmentalists and Their Vision
for the Future." He assessed the 2008 field and said no candidate so far is doing a great job staking out progressive
environmental policy. Washington Times: Kerry conspicuous even out of '08 fray

NY JOINS THE "BIG-STATE STAMPEDE" ON FEB. 5: Gov. Eliot Spitzer Monday signed a law moving New York's primary up a
month to Feb. 5, a shift that will favor native son Rudolph Giuliani and transplanted native daughter Sen. Hillary
Rodham Clinton. New York joins a big-state stampede to the front of the primary calendar, but the move could have an
unintended effect, making the earlier primary and caucus states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina --
even more important, some analysts say. "This is all creating the opposite of what New York and the other big states
want to do," said Joe Trippi, who piloted Howard Dean's 2004 campaign. "Whoever wins New Hampshire or Iowa or Nevada
will have momentum going into Feb. 5, and they'll win many of the big states on that day. It will amplify the
importance of the early states and shorten the race. Candidates won't have time to recover." Newsday: New York gets a
primary primary http://www.newsday.com/news/local/newyork/ny-usprim0410,0,255356.story

MOVEON LAUNCHES "VIRTUAL TOWN HALL": Seven candidates for the 2008 Democratic Party nomination will take part tonight
in a live "virtual town hall" forum about the Iraq war, in what is being billed as the largest and most ambitious
experiment yet in harnessing the power of Internet technology to reshape participatory democracy. Calling in by
telephone, candidates Joseph Biden, Hillary Clinton, Christopher Dodd, John Edwards, Dennis Kucinich, Barack Obama, and
Bill Richardson will each answer several questions about Iraq. The liberal activist group MoveOn.org , which is hosting
the event, asked members to vote on which questions to ask from among 6,800 queries proposed by members for the forum.
About 10,000 MoveOn members are expected to gather in about 950 living rooms around the country to listen to the event,
which begins at 7 p.m. and will be streamed live on the group's website and broadcast on the liberal talk radio network
Air America. The group will conduct a straw poll afterward among its 3.2 million members about which candidate gave the
strongest answers. Boston Globe: Campaigning gets a new Web version

McCAIN PUSHES IRAQ PROGRESS AT PRESSER: Sen. John McCain returned from his visit to Iraq playing down the extreme
security precautions taken during his shopping trip at a war-torn Baghdad marketplace and insisting that the United
States can still salvage victory if the American public doesn't abandon hope. "Of course, it isn't entirely safe, but
it certainly is a functioning market, and progress is being made there," McCain said Monday at an afternoon news
conference in Phoenix.	"I talked to literally hundreds of Iraqis in the over an hour that we were in that market, and,
although worried, and specifically worried about a sniper that was operating in the area, every one of them that I
talked to said they were making progress and things were better," he added. Arizona Republic: McCain emphasizes
progress made in Iraq http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/0410mccaintalks0410.html

CLINTON, OBAMA DROP OUT OF FOX DEBATE: Sen. Barack Obama escalated his war with Fox News yesterday by bailing out of a
network-sponsored debate - effectively killing the Sept. 23 talkfest in Detroit. Obama had been under pressure from
liberal activists to stiff the debate, as former Sen. John Edwards did on Friday. Because the event was also being
sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus, to which Obama belongs, his decision to pull out gave other candidates the
cover to walk away, too. Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) said she would not attend, either. Accusing Fox of conservative
and anti-black bias, a group called ColorOfChange.org had petitioned the black caucus to quit "dancing with the Devil"
by hosting debates with Fox. Without the three marquee candidates, it was likely Fox would scrap the debate. A Fox
spokeswoman could not be immediately reached for comment. New York Daily News: Bam tunes out Fox debate

OBAMA DRAWS BIG BUCKS, CELEBS IN NYC: Riding a first-quarter fund-raising wave that came within close reach of Senator
Clinton's surge, Senator Obama swept through New York City last night to attend three overlapping fund-raisers and
appear on "Late Show with David Letterman." Mr. Obama emerged from a black sport-utility vehicle with a wide smile on
his face shortly after 6 p.m. yesterday to attend the first reception, at the Upper West Side home of Kenneth Lerer,
co-founder of a political Web log, the Huffington Post. Mr. Lerer cohosted the fund-raiser with a former AOL Time
Warner chief operating officer, Robert Pittman. The $2,300-a-head event drew dozens of supporters, many of whom arrived
outside the El Dorado building on Central Park West in chauffeured cars. Several celebrities stood out in the crowd,
including sportscaster Ahmad Rashad, film director Ron Howard, and former television news anchor Tom Brokaw, who said
on his way in: "I'm here as a freebie." New York Sun: Hot Fund-Raiser Obama Barnstorms New York City
http://www.nysun.com/article/52151

FICTITIOUS TRIP TO LIBYA: There's a story pinging around the Internet about how Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) paid a visit
to Libya in 1984 and met with Louis Farrakhan, the Chicago-based Nation of Islam leader whose anti-Semitic remarks have
long inflamed relations between blacks and Jews. But it wasn't Obama who took the 1984 trip. It was his pastor, Rev.
Jeremiah Wright Jr. The error made its way to the Internet a couple of weeks ago, when a conservative Christian leader
-- who was actually trying to defend Obama's position on Israel -- apparently confused the two men when speaking to a
reporter for a religious news Web site. Chicago Tribune: Mythical trip started with an error

RICHARDSON SAYS "HE HAS A BETTER CHANCE THAN THE OTHER UNDERDOGS": Allies and critics agree that Richardson, 59, has
become the dominating force in New Mexico politics. But it's not so on the national scene, where Richardson - perhaps
best-known as a former U.N. ambassador and a freelance negotiator in international hotspots - faces an uphill battle
for the Democratic presidential nomination. He lags far behind front-runners Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama,
and also trails John Edwards. Richardson's advisors say they're not worried — it's too early for longshots like the
governor to pull ahead, and they expect his unvarnished, outsized personality to charm primary voters. He contends he
has a better chance than the other underdogs: "I'm perfectly content to be the only candidate in the second tier." Once
voters learn about what Richardson has done in New Mexico, they'll pay attention, supporters say. Even the governor's
opponents in the state acknowledge that he's a formidable political figure. Los Angeles Times: Richardson content to
start slow in White House race http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-richardson10apr10,1,3239125.story
