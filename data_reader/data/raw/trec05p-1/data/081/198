Pretty much correct.  Actual is:

Curry	$20,439,468
Sukaly	$0 (somehow 4 midmarketing deals I did got credited to Sukaly so I moved the $27,602 to me!)
Ahn	$12,181 (associate)
Jester	$10,000 (just started in group a couple of months ago)

Doug Gilbert-Smith supported me from the trading side to help get the wind deal done and he has been paid 50% of its value $18MM.  No one else was working with me on the wind deal other than support groups.  Portz in legal was instrumental in getting the contract done with Enron Wind.  Edith Cross and Greg Trefz in structuring also pulled long nights to get the deal approved.

Thanks, - Mike
