Move to a leaner Enron 
Enron has divided its business units into three categories: core businesses it plans to keep; noncore, which are for sale; and under review, ones it may sell. 
All core businesses are expected to be retained, while noncore businesses, which include about $8 billion in assets, will be sold or spun off over the next year. Those businesses under review are those that the company says have good earnings potential, but it's not yet clear if they will stay.
