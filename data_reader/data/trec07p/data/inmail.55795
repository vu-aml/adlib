features, cooperation with hardware vendors, and software patents. From
the interview: 'I don't think [Microsoft's patent threats] are the
biggest danger. As Microsoft has been finding out recently it is the
patent trolls, and organisations with buried patents in interesting areas
that are the biggest threat in the USA. The real answer to that problem,
however, is to pull the USA back into line with the majority of the world
which simply does not recognize patents on software but respects them as
literary works subject to copyright law.'"

CNN reports that twelve major universities around the country have
[0]agreed to have substantial portions of their libraries included in the
Google Books project. Around ten million volumes are expected to be
included in the project. Participating schools include the University of
Chicago and the 11 universities in the Big Ten athletic conference:
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Michigan State, Minnesota,
Northwestern, Ohio State, Penn State, Purdue and Wisconsin. "The
committee said Google will scan and index materials 'in a manner
consistent with copyright law.' Google generally makes available the full
text of books in the public domain and limited portions of copyrighted
books. Several other universities, including Harvard and California,
already have signed up to let Google scan their libraries. "

was a regular CNBC viewer, and when the opportunity arose he took the
'Million Dollar Portfolio Challenge' very seriously. At one point, he was
spending 12 hours a day on the contest, using three computers to trade
1,600 different portfolios in a theoretical stock game. His efforts got
him into the top 20 finalists, but in the last round of trading he
noticed some unusual patterns. 'One trader had a stream of near-perfect
picks, consistently placing huge bets on shares that soared in
after-hours trading. Kraber suspected the trader and perhaps others were
getting help from someone who was changing their picks after the stocks'
increases — and he quickly notified CNBC ... Kraber says CNBC rebuffed
him at the time, but now it looks like he may have been right.'"

wikkedwoman wrote with a link to a Washington Post story about the [0]use
of satellite imagery to detect atrocities around the world. The story
details Amnesty International's efforts to identify areas in the world
that may have been subject to man-made disasters. By comparing and
contrasting imagery captured over time, researchers can produce hard
evidence to present to a hard-to-please international community.
"Tonight, [Amnesty Researcher Jeremy] Nelson begins his work by making a
copy of the [older] shot in the right-hand screen and pasting it directly
over the [newer] one on the left. Then he makes the top one nearly
transparent. A river that cuts through the scene becomes a marker to help
him line up the two. Now he can easily flip back and forth to look for
changes. Sudanese huts tend to follow a similar pattern: a solid base
ring with a steep, thatched roof. In the earlier image, they show up as
small circles, with a slight shading to the dome, depending on the
direction of the sun. Nelson draws a small, green circle slightly larger
than the area of the average hut and makes several dozen copies of it ...
When he finishes, he moves the 2007 shot to the top and begins the
analysis again ... parts of this region were burned so thoroughly that
there's nothing left but a large black scar. If you didn't know that huts
were there before, you'd have no idea they were now gone. 'Whoever did
this did a good job,' he says quietly. 'Thorough, at least.'"

If you still have your copy sitting unwatched on your Tivo, I'd suggest
that you stop reading before you are spoiled. The show is done at last
and apparently fans are freaking out over the bizarre ending. At my
house, we thought at first that the DVR crashed until the credits
appeared in silence. Personally I thought that a show known for such
excess tried to take an artful bow: It didn't work for me, but I get it
at least. Anyway, I had a number of Sopranos submissions this morning and
figured I'd just post this comment to give people who were interested in
discussing the end of the show a nice place to discuss before they cancel
their HBO.

agency in the country that oversees all federal intelligence agencies,
appears to have [1]inadvertently released the keys to that number in an
unclassified PowerPoint presentation now posted on the website of the
Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). By reverse engineering the numbers in
an underlying data element embedded in the presentation, it seems that
the total budget of the 16 US intelligence agencies in fiscal year 2005
was $60 billion, almost 25% higher than previously believed."

up LAMP; configuring a load-balancing, high-availability environment;
working with virtualization. None of the chapters are in-depth
examinations of their subjects; rather, they're enough to get you started

direction." Read below for the rest of Bob's review.

[0]Lucas123 writes "K-12 school districts throughout the US have a
daunting [1]IT homework assignment over the summer: Develop systems that
ensure their electronic documents, email and instant messages are in
compliance with new federal e-discovery regulations, much in the same way
corporations have been preparing over the past year. The new Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) are expected to be widely enforced by the
end of 2007, according to a Computerworld story. '"A lack of preparation
could prove dire for K-12 school districts, which oftentimes lack
technical proficiency, funding and legal expertise," said Robert Ayers,
technology coordinator for the Kingston, Pa.-based Luzerne Intermediate
Unit 18 school district.'"

| Liquid Lens Can Magnify at the Flick of a Switch                   |

An anonymous reader writes "German engineers have designed the first
[0]liquid camera lens with no moving parts that provides two levels of
zoom. 'Liquid lenses bend light using the curved boundary between watery
and oily liquids. When the two liquids are held in the right container,
the boundary between them can be made to curve in a way that focuses
light simply by applying a voltage. Liquid lenses have attracted much
attention because they are potentially smaller than conventional optics
and cheaper to build. Samsung has already built them into some
cellphones.'"

CNet is reporting that a blogger from the Courier-Journal of Louisville,
KY was recently [0]ejected from an NCAA game for live-blogging.
"According to the Courier-Journal, staff blogger Brian Bennett was
approached by NCAA officials in the fifth inning of a game between the
University of Lousville and Oklahoma State, told that blogging 'from an
NCAA championship event "is against NCAA policies (and) we're revoking
the (press) credential and need to ask you to leave the stadium."'"

[0]athloi writes to mention that Texas legislators have passed a bill
that would require computer companies to provide [1]free recycling
services to their customers for hardware purchased. "The bill (HB 2714)
requires computer manufacturers to provide a "reasonably convenient"
recycling plan that requires no additional payments from consumers. Dell
and HP provided some model legislation that was used as the basis for the
bill, which will only affect computers purchased for personal or home
business use, but it could still encourage manufacturers to adopt
efficient recycling programs that might then be applied to all machines
sold."

firesquirt sends us an article from Wired about a survey they conducted
to determine [0]major ISPs' data retention and other privacy practices.
Over a period of two months, four national ISPs would not give Wired the
time of day; and another four answered some of their questions in a
fashion not altogether reassuring.
