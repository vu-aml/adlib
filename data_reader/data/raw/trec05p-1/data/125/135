Hey Jeff,

I talked with Rob about all of this...but just wanted to keep you posted. 

I talked to a friend (head scheduler) at LOOP and he said that LOOP was closed (not really closed, they actually went to minimal operations) because there were no vessels demanding LOOP offloading and storage this week for that 70+ hour period of time.  When I asked him about this last weekend (9-12) he told me that, same as last week, "there just simply weren't any vessels wanting to unload crude."  

Matt
