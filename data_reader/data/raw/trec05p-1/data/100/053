Five weeks removed from arthroscopic knee surgery, the Denver Broncos running back was taken by surprise Wednesday when told of news reports saying he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the season.   "At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday," Davis said.   Davis admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks.   He remained on the scout team Wednesday. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report.  </FONT>

According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him. </FONT>

Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL.  </FONT>

Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence.

According to the <I>

"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again." If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.</FONT>

Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.</FONT>

Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.</FONT>

According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards.

Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. "I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area," Grbac said Monday. "There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see." Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play. <BR>

The Rams' defense won't be able to stop the Tampa Bay offense from gaining yards this week so Gramatica will get a lot of opportunities to score, whether it's a field goal attempt or a point after. Expect him to make good on his opportunities. He is currently the hottest kicker in the NFL having made 19 of his last 20 attempts. Gramatica's hot streak was good enough to earn him a selection to this season's Pro Bowl team. Look for him to turn in another Pro Bowl-caliber performance against the Rams Monday and score a lot of Fantasy points for your squad. <BR>
