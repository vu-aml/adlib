MR.WANG QIN
HANG SENG BANK LTD.
DES VOEUX RD,BRANCH
CENTRAL HONG KONG.
HONG KONG.


Dear Friend,
I am Mr.Wang Qin, Foreign Exhange Credit Manager of 
Hang Seng Bank Ltd, Hong Kong. 
I am confident that you are a honorable and reputable 
person whom I can vouchsafe in, in confidence, and we 
can work together.
On october 6, 1999, an American consultant/contractor
with  the Chinese Solid  Minerals Corporation,
Mr. Smith Lawrence made a (Fixed) Deposit for
twelve calendar months, valued at (sixty-eight Million  
Dollars only) in my branch.
Upon maturity,I sent a routine  notification to
his forwarding address but got no reply. After a
month, we  sent a reminder and finally we discovered
from his contract employers, the  Hong Kong Solid
Minerals Corporation that Mr. Smith Lawrence died
from an  automobile accident. On further
investigation,I found out that he died  without making
a will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was
fruitless.
I therefore made further investigation and discovered
that  Mr. Smith Lawrence did not declare any kin or
relations in all his  official documents, including
his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This money
is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled 
over with the principal sum at the end of each year. 
No one will ever come forward to claim it.
According to the Hong Kong Law,under china's
foreign and defense affairs,at the expiration
of 5 (five) years,such funds will revert to the
ownership of the chinese Government for financing
military operations,such as purchasing of arms
and ammunitions for the military.
In order to avert this negative development,i will
like to seek for your permission as a foreigner to
stand as the next of kin to Mr. Smith Lawrence so
that the fruits of this old man's labor will not
be use for financing weapons which will further
enhance the courses of war in the world in
general.
The money will be paid into your account for us to
share in the ratio of 70% for me and 20% for you
and 10% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the
transaction.There is no risk at all as all the
paperwork  for this transaction will be done by my
attorney and with my position as the credit
officer guarantees the successful execution
of this transaction. If you are interested,
please reply immediately.
Upon your response, I shall then provide
you with more  details and that will help
you understand the transaction.
You should observe utmost confidentiality,
and rest assured  that this  transaction would
be most profitable for both of us because I
shall require your assistance to invest my share
in your country.
Please respond through my very private email address:
mrwangqin2002@yahoo.com.hk 
Awaiting your urgent reply.
Thanks and regards.
Mr.Wang Qin.
