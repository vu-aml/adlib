Who are the players?
Then we invite you to...

Kris Hagerman, SVP Strategic Operations, Veritas Software

If you're curious about storage, here's a link to a HaasWeek article I wrote last spring on storage. The numbers are dated, but the info is the same. Just click on Haas Happens and go to Tech Talk II.
