Thanks, very much Alan.  Hedy, Bev and Scott are still technically on board until the end of the month, but that's fairly "ceremonial," so to speak.  Let's do this.  I'll give Hedy a call and see if they'd be willing to attend and report back. In my view, given the circumstances, if they've got conflicts and can't make it, I'm not inclinded to push it.  Sound reasonable?

Best,
Jeff

Paul, Jeff:

I got on the IEP Board distribution list (Parquet is also on it).  Are there any actions we need to take with our Sacto lobbiests that I can help with?

Dear IEP Board Member,

During the December 13th IEP Board Planning Meeting, a special session for
Board Members and your contract Lobbyist is being planned.  This special
session will be held between 1:00 pm and 3:00 p.m., Sterling Hotel,
Sacramento.   This memo is sent to you as a notice so that, if possible, you
can arrange for your contract Lobbyist to be available during that time.
Please don't hesitate to contact IEP if you have any questions.
