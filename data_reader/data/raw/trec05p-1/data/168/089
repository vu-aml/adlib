Hi Paul,
Well lets see - where do I start- first of all I am in the process of moving 
to Denver- I am still in Scottsdale, AZ. I am moving next week to the 
Littleton area.  It been very annoying to move around this time but I had 
to. I took a position with the Denver Federal Center and they wanted me to 
start asap.  So I decided to make the move!

About me- I am 27 yrs old- very ambitious.  I work very hard but love to 
play hard as well. I feel that lifes to short and to be stressed out is just 
not worth it.  I like to be around professional people but they have to have 
a great sense of humor and like to have fun.  Someone with no personality is 
just not for me!!! I've been told I have a very warm personality- I pretty 
much can get along with everyone.  It surprises people but I never could 
understand that. They usually say that if they didnt know me, thats not what 
they would think.
I actually like to do about anything once.  My philosophy on what I like to 
do is - its not "what" we do its "who" we do it with. I do enjoy very much 
to go out and experience the nicer restaurants. I enjoy the theatre and 
musicals.  I can go on and on....
So if I havent answered your question.  Do ask...
DO you have any other pics to share?
Marlene
