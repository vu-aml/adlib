hello love.  flat stanley needs a few more photos, but will be back a bit
after thanksgiving.  tell sam that stan and are having a guten time.

cheers for continuing to take initiative with the pedernales (and for
ceasing to call it a ranch).  good on you.  in regards to the bulldozer to
take a path to the swimming hole, you best think twice about that.  of
course that has been bandied about for some ten years now, but there is no
easy solution.  bulldozers cost a buttload, and it wouldn't be able to make
it all the way down to the waters' edge anyway - boulders are too big and
the floods will destroy any path for twenty five to thirty yards from the
river.

resign yourself to the fact that we will never have a lovely footpath to the
swimming hole - that land is much different from the land through which the
guadelupe runs.  we can definitely, however, improve on what there is now,
which is primarily a game track slightly improved by myself on the upper
reaches close to the yard.  not so sure about the bulldozer....

good luck getting everyone together.  hope all is well with y'all.  am off
on a date just now - keep well -

rolland
