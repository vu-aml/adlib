Tri-Met is the regional transportation company for the greater Portland area.  A good overview can be found on www.tri-met.org <http://www.tri-met.org>.  From the web page, the full name and address is:

Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon (Tri-Met)
4012 SE 17th Avenue
Portland, OR 97202

The ISDA that we left with them was dated 1992 and was a generic version.  We have not even had credit discussions yet.  

Let me know if you would like any additional information.
Thanks,
John

John:
Tthanks for the heads-up.  What is the full name of this party?  Exactly what "ISDA" did you  leave for them to review (i.e., was this a customized agreement with credit?)?  Can I please have a copy in case someone calls me.

Thanks.  Sara

Brian:

Thank you for meeting with myself and John Malowney today to discuss the opportunities for Enron and Tri-Met to work together.  As we discussed, in order for Enron to provide either physical or financial products as an Oregon Direct Access ESS provider, the EEI and ISDA contracts that we left with you today will need to be executed.  

Please feel free to contact the following individuals in our legal department at Enron to discuss the documents in more detail.
