Latest NFL Player News

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>Tacoma News Tribune</I>, Seahawks Head Coach Mike
Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as
he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. "We'll cross that
bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I
didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he
got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would
suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again." If you have the roster
room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure
you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost
the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy
rosters at this point.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game
against Miami, according to the <I>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</I>. He
replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with
a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a
Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at
Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the
concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Dedric Ward, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss
Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point
in the season.

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected
to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of
Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend
you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is
hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this
week.

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a
sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken
ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback
game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided
whether they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the
Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't
recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain
he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>St. Petersburg Times</I>, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring
strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the
week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish
it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled
late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11
carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to
post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster
allows for a solid replacement. 

Joe Nedney, K TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this
week. 

Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury.
However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 10/23/01
Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's
game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in
this week's game. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's
game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
<i>The Tennessean</i> reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back.
The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment
options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to
play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder
showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status
for next week's game remains uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to
week, they increase his exercises and change of direction," head coach Tom
Coughlin told <i>The Florida Times-Union</i>. "It remains to be seen when
Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well
this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return
date] next week." Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his
groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to
play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told <i>The Baltimore
Sun</i> he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game.
Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained
ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at
running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against
Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. "I'm day-to-day. I'm
feeling pretty sore in the chest area," Grbac said Monday. "There could be
something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown
a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see." Randall Cunningham will
replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York
Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game
against New Orleans. 

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</I>, Canidate is expected to
start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. "I
wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game," coach Mike Martz said.
"He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to
let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play." Canidate proved
himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be
starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close
to being completely healthy. "Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was
a blessing for me because I was able to get treatment every day," Stokes
told the <I>Contra Costa Times</I>. "I practiced today good. I wouldn't say
I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close." Stokes has been less than mediocre,
however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to
be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants'
starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on
Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his
surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a
sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game
against New Orleans. "I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week
ago," Martz said. "I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this
game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to
let him play." Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is
he's unable to go. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Wright is expected to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling
in his right knee. Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so
starting Wright from a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable. 

Dez White, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>, White will start in place of the
injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his ball-catching
abilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of deeper
leagues. 

David Terrell, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Terrell will not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus
Robinson, as was reportedly earlier. <I>The Chicago Sun-Times</I> is now
reporting that Dez White will start in place of Robinson, with Terrell
being used as the team's third receiver. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
Martin will have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The
team feels confident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game
against Dallas, so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then. 

Rob Moore, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular
season game this season. Moore, who has been dealing with a hamstring
injury, continues to have setbacks in his recovery. "I was hoping we'd see
him by now, McGinnis told the <I>Arizona Republic</I>. "That's why we both
handled it like we did in training camp and we paced him. We were planning
to have him from the start. I can't tell you when he'll be back. Until he
can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have him." If Moore is still
on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/22/01
Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday
night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron
Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge
of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday that Huntley will enter Week
Seven as the team's starting tailback. "He has progressed from the
standpoint that he is now healthy," said Seifert. "Here's a golden
opportunity." See if Huntley is still available in your league, as he looks
to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina starting RB job.

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/22/01
Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh.
The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep
him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress
during the week before deciding whether to use him in Week Seven.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against
Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice
this week and could miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye
on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/22/01
Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against
Pittsburgh. "I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in,"
Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy told the <I>St. Petersburg Times</I>. "Warrick
pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who
it'll be carrying the load." Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured,
so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week
Seven.

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/22/01
Favre injured his right elbow in the final seconds of Sunday's game at
Minnesota. Fortunately, the Packers have a bye week in Week Seven, so he
should have time to recover. "It'll be OK," Favre told the <I>Milwaukee
Journal-Sentinel</I>. "Thank goodness I have a week to relax. I think that
will help."

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Stewart left Sunday's game against Tennessee in the fourth quarter with a
sprained right ankle. He is listed as day to day, and Lamont Warren
finished the game in his absence.

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/22/01
Despite a great performance by Thomas Sunday against Cincinnati, the
<I>Chicago Tribune</I> reports that the Bears will continue to use an
alternating system with him and James Allen. "We will continue to use them
both," said offensive coordinator John Shoop. "Anthony did a great job
today, though." As long as this duo continues to split carries, it's hard
to recommend either as a weekly starter in a Fantasy league. We believe
Thomas is the better long-term pick, though.

Brad Hoover, RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Hoover left Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. The injury is not
believed to be serious. Monitor Hoover's situation. He might get some
carries now that starter Tshimanga Biakabutuka is out for the season. 

Fred Baxter, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Baxter returned from muscle spasms Sunday against Cincinnati, and had a
one-yard TD reception in the game. Despite the solid performance, he's
still not a reliable weekly starter in a Fantasy league.

Robert Wilson, WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Wilson suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game and was held to a 24-yard
reception. He is also recovering from a broken thumb. Wilson will be
evaluated on a daily basis. 

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Luccis Losers Updated 10/22/01
Cleeland suffered a knee injury in Sunday's game, but it is not considered
to be serious. He still managed to catch one pass, a 19-yard TD reception.
Cleeland will be evaluated on a daily basis. 

David Terrell, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Terrell will start at wide receiver in place of injured Marcus Robinson in
Sunday's game against San Francisco. If you're a Robinson owner, consider
adding Terrell to your squad. The rookie had seven receptions for 91 yards
on Sunday.

Neil Rackers, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
According to published reports, the Bengals are becoming frustrated with
Rackers' erratic play. The team might look into signing another kicker.

Freddie Jones, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/22/01
Jones sprained his ankle against Denver. His current status is day to day.

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Scott suffered bruised ribs against the Bears. He is not expected to miss
next week's game against Detroit.

J.R. Redmond, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/22/01
Redmond made his return from an ankle injury on Sunday, and had one carry
for no yards. He won't see enough playing time to help Fantasy leaguers.

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/22/01
Grbac is day to day with a rib contusion. His status for next week's game
is uncertain. Randall Cunningham would start if Grbac can't play.

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/22/01
Allen is day to day with a sprained left ankle. According to the
<i>Baltimore Sun</i>, the Ravens have been shopping for RB help, indicating
Allen's status as a starter is anything but firm.

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Christian suffered a sprained neck in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated
on a daily basis. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Jefferson aggravated back, left ankle and big toe injuries Sunday and also
burst the bursa sac in his right elbow. He might not be at full strength,
but Jefferson is expected to play when the Falcons return from their bye on
November 4. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/22/01
Smith suffered a sprained knee Sunday but is expected to play in the
Falcons' next game. Atlanta has a bye this week and doesn't play again
until November 4. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 10/22/01
Bruce was held to two catches for 37 yards Sunday, but that wasn't
necessarily a reflection on him. The Rams were able to run the ball
successfully so they didn't pass as much as they normally do. Look for
Bruce to do better next week against the Saints. 

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/22/01
Detroit Lions coach Marty Mornhinweg said Monday that Crowell tore the
patella tendon in his left knee and will miss the rest of the season.
Crowell suffered the injury while leaping for a pass in the end zone in the
second half of Sunday's game. The Lions will use a combination of Larry
Foster, Scotty Anderson and Desmond Howard in his absence.

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/22/01
Robinson suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral
ligament in his left knee in Sunday's win over the Cincinnati Bengals and
will miss the rest of the season. Robinson had to be carted off the field
with six minutes left in the first half after the injury. Marty Booker will
be the primary receiver in his absence.

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/22/01
Richardson (shoulder) did play against the Cardinals. He was used in
goal-line packages and had one carry and one reception for 24 total yards.
He will probably be used sparingly as a runner now that Priest Holmes has
clearly emerged as a featured back.

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 10/22/01
Williams, who was averaging 4.5 yards a carry, gained just 51 yards on 21
carries Sunday, a 2.4-yard average. He had eight carries for 5 yards in the
second half. "We couldn't do anything in the second half," Williams said.
"We didn't block right a few times, other times they filled holes and made
plays." Look for Williams to rebound and have a solid game against the Rams
this Sunday. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Chandler had another solid game Sunday throwing touchdown passes of 57 and
39 yards. He also completed 14 of 20 passes for 187 yards. Look for him to
be an adequate starter for the rest of the season. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/22/01
Biakabutuka broke his foot in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game after
rushing for 121 yards and a touchdown. He is to have surgery Monday and is
out for the season. 

Corey Bradford, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective
at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to
prove himself as a Fantasy player.

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions was
good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games
this year and has become a major scoring threat even though he is not very
effective outside of the red zone.

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/21/01
Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving and a
touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, however,
but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench him. 

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona.
Green has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a
starting nod every week. 

Doug Chapman, RB MIN - Team Dick Updated 10/21/01
Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers
were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so
far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot
stay healthy or continues to struggle.

David Boston, WR ARI - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions for 131
yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the league
and is worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/21/01
Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards
of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with
any regularity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 10/21/01
Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for 107
yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to
start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot. 

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/21/01
Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on
Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's
still one of the top Fantasy players in the league. 

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a
score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a
Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/21/01
Griese (shoulder) started Sunday's game against San Diego, but he was
ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions
in Denver's 27-10 loss. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/21/01
Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the
potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not
find the end zone often. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/21/01
The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran
runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.

David Terrell, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Terrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus
Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the
Chicago passing game.

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly
establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears'
featured back for the rest of the year.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/21/01
Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yards and a TD at Detroit. Despite some
quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE,
especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to
Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but
he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/21/01
McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He
completed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate,
possibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/21/01
George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. The lack of a
reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hindered his production
this year. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saints. The
speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect good
numbers from him every week.

Alge Crumpler, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New Orleans.
Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the remainder of the
year.

Albert Connell, WR NO - Uran Man Updated 10/21/01
Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is
definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 10/21/01
Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the
Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality Atlanta defense indicate
Jackson is not capable of providing owners with regularly good numbers.

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/21/01
Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still
making important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is
limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week,
but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh
defense.

Anthony Becht, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards
and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but his
potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a position
lacking quality players. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/21/01
Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed
a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout
should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He
also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile
good numbers against any defense.

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Canidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of
total offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be
short-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk. 

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/21/01
Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, posting six catches for 208 yards and a
score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the
No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot from a
Fantasy perspective. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Banks finally had a somewhat productive game on Sunday, throwing for 346
yards and a score against Carolina. His performance doesn't make him any
more valuable from a Fantasy perspective, however, so don't consider him
any better than a reserve. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/21/01
Muhammad was somewhat limited during Sunday's game against Washington due
to a nagging rib injury. He caught only two passes for 27 yards in the
contest, and may have cost some Fantasy owners a victory this week. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/21/01
Jackson had a surprisingly productive game against Baltimore, rushing for
77 yards and a score. The rookie seems to be all the way back from a
nagging rib injury, and is slowly becoming a good Fantasy player. 

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/21/01
Crowell was carted off the field in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game
with a knee injury. According to published reports, he is likely out for
the season. Larry Foster will probably become Detroit's No. 2 receiver for
the remainder of the year.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/21/01
Harrison had a huge game against New England, posting eight catches for 157
yards and a score. It wasn't enough to win, however, as the Patriots blew
out the Colts, 38-17. 

 Colts, DT IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/21/01
The Colts defense continues to be horrendous, surrending 38 points to Tom
Brady and the New England Patriots on Sunday. At this point, the only
Fantasy value this unit offers is if you have offensive players facing them
in the coming weeks.
