I'll get duplicate copies to you for signature. The reason for doing this is more the former than the latter mentioned below.  However, there is a concern that other UK nationals remaining on the UK payroll could try to use the US non-discrimination rules to obtain US benefits, if you were provided both. Their success in such a challenge is questionable.

OK. Much better. Explain to me again why we have to do this? Is it purely to confirm we don't get stuff twice or is there a concern that our participation in both causes a sub-space paradox which may create a time vacuum into which the entire world population may be sucked?

David,

Let me know if this latest version is acceptable and I'll prepare a waiver for Louise and Mark, as well.
