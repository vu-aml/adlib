P.M.B.5028
ACCRA-REPUBLIC OF GHANA

Alternative Email;k_collins@yahoo.fr
           ACCOUNT PROVISION FOR USD45.5 MILLION
I am Dr.KOFFI COLLINS. The Chairman, Contract Awarding Committee of the
ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST AFRICAN STATES  (ECOWAS)with its fund 
Headquarters
in Accra-Ghana.
I got your information in a Proffesional database when I was searching 
through
Internet for a reliable,honest and trustworthy person to entrust this 
business
with.I was simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact from the 
many
names in the list of the directory.
After discussing my view and your profile with my colleagues,they were 
very
much satisfied and decided to contact you immediately for this mutual 
business
relationship.We wish to transfer the sum of USD
45.5,000,000.00 (Forty five million five hundred thousand United States
Dollars only.)into your personal or company`s bank account.
This fund was a residue of the over invoiced contract bills awarded by 
us
intentionally for the supply of  hard/soft wares,phamaceauticals/ 
medical
items,light and heavy duty vehicles, apparels and other 
administrative/logistics
for the ECOMOG in Sierra-Leone and Liberia during the Peace Keeping  
Projects.
This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully protected with the
cooperation and mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary of 
the
Organization.We arranged and over invoiced the contract funds supplied 
by
different companies from different countries during the crisis. It was 
our
consensus to seek the assistance of a willing foreigner to provide us 
with
the facilities to transfer this money out of West Africa.
This is borne out of our belief in the non-stable and porous political 
nature
of this sub-region. The  original contractors have been duly paid by 
Ecowas
banker through the Central bank of Ghana and Finance Ministry.The 
balance
is suspended in the ECOWAS grand Account awaiting claims by any foreign
partner of our choice to receive the fund on our behalf Now Ecowas is 
intending
to pay all their outstanding balance of their contractors this year as 
the
organization is winding up its activities since the aim of returning 
PEACE
to the countries and the coast has been achieved.
Based on the laws and ethics of employment,we as civil servants working
under this organization, are not allowed to operate/own a foreign 
account.This
is more reason why we needed your urgent assistance to provide an 
account
that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment 
with
your comprehensive advise,assistance and partnership in your country.
It is however agreed,as the account owner in this deal to allow you 30%
of the entire sum as compensation, 65% will be held on trust for us 
while
5% will be used to defray any incidental charges and cost during the 
course
of the transaction. This transaction will be successfully concluded 
within
14 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due cooperation.
You should provide the followings for immediate kick of of this deal if
it interest you; YOUR COMPANY`S NAME WITH COMPLETE ADDRESS,TEL AND FAX 
NUMBERS.(if
available) THE NAME OF YOUR BANK,ITS ADDRESS WITH TEL,FAX AND TELEX 
NUMBERS.
THE ACCOUNT NUMBER THE COMPLETE MAILING ADDRESS OF THE BENEFICIARY WITH
TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.
Upon the receipt of this informations,application for claim will be 
sent
to you to fill and return back to the organization in pursuit of the 
claim
legally and then be forwarded to the organization for ratification and 
subsequent
payment. As with the case of all organized (sensitive)and conspired 
DEALS,we
solicit for your unreserved confidentiality and utmost secret in this 
business.
We hope to retire peacefully and lead honorable business life 
afterwards.There
are no risks involved .
Kindly expedite action if you are interested as we are behind schedule 
to
enable us utilize this golden  opportunity pay out this fund 
immediately
which we might stand to loose, if we fail to provide a safe  account 
for
this transfer on time at the expiration of this year Ecowas has mapped 
out
for payment of all their outstanding contractors and the dissolution of
our committee.Please urgency is needed as we do not know the time our 
organization
will start the payment hence it is necessary to start on time to 
forestall
any hitch while transferring the fund into your designated account .
Hoping to hear from you.
With regards.
Dr.KOFFI COLLINS
