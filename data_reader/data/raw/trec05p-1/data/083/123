STANDARD BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA,
9TH FLOOR,
HEERENGRACHT TOWER,
STANDARD BANK CENTER,
JOHHANESBURG, SOUTH
AFRICA.

Attn: The President/CEO

I am Mr Williams Kalu Provincial Director Standard
Bank of South Africa, Johannesburg Branch. I have urgent
and very confidential business proposition for you.
On June 6, 1999, a foreign Oil consultant/contractor
with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Richard
Moss made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve
calendar months, valued at US$12,500,000.00 (Twelve
Million five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars)
in my branch.

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we
sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employers,the South Africa Mining Corporation
that Mr.Richard Moss died from an automobile accident.
On further investigation, I found out that he died
without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his
next of kin was fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered
that Mr. Richard Moss did not declare any kin or
relations in all his official documents,including his
Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of
US$12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million five Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars) is still sitting in my Bank and
the interest is being rolled over with the principal
sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come
forward to claim it.According to South Africa Law, at
the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will
revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government
if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.
Richard Moss so that the fruits of this old man's
labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt
government officials. This is simple, I will like you
to provide immediately your full names and address so
that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents
and affidavits which will put you in place as the next
of kin.

We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for
drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain
the necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.
A bank account in any part of the world which you will
provide will then facilitate the transfer of this
money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money
will be paid into your account for us to share in the
ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the Attorney and my
position as the Branch Manager guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction. If you are
interested, please reply immediately via the private
email address below. Upon your response, I shall then
provide you with more details and relevant documents
that will help you understand the transaction.

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest
assured that this transaction would be most profitable
for both of us because I shall require your assistance
to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply via my
email:westpoint_kalu2@yahoo.com

Thanks and regards.

MR WILLIAMS KALU
