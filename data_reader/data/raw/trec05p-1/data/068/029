Many of these warnings are hoaxes but here's another red flag.

URGENT ATTENTION 
Attention all Internet Users: 
This looks like a bad one that's coming. Forward this to others.

Please read and forward to everyone you know...... 
DO NOT OPEN: "NEW PICTURES OF FAMILY" 
It is a virus that will erase your whole "C" drive. 
It will come to you in the form of a E-mail from a familiar
person. 
I repeat a friend sent it to me, but called & warned me before I
opened it. 
He was not so lucky and now he can't even start his computer! 
Forward this to everyone in your address book. I would rather
receive this 25 times than not at all. Also: Intel announced
that a new and very destructive virus was discovered recently.
If you receive an email called "FAMILY PICTURES," do not open
it. Delete it right away! 
This virus removes all dynamic link libraries (.dll files) from
your computer. 
Your computer will not be able to boot up. 
Thanks,
