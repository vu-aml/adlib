OPEN SEASON

 

SG Resources Mississippi, L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of SGR 

Holdings, L.L.C., is conducting an open season for firm storage 

services at its new high-deliverability, salt cavern, natural gas 

storage facility, known as the Southern Pines Energy Center. The open 

season will begin at 9:00 a.m. CDT on February 4, 2002, and will 

continue until 5:00 p.m. CDT on March 4, 2002. The project is located 

at the border of Mississippi and Alabama with access to the major 

pipelines serving the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeastern United 

States. The facility is ideally located to serve as a transportation 

and storage hub for shippers on any one of nine major pipelines that 

will be interconnected directly or indirectly to the project. 

Information on the facility and the Open Season is available on our 

web site at
