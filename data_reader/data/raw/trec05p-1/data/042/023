microcap stocks, today's company has additiona| risk
factors that raise doubt about its abi|ity to continue

its inception,reliance on loans from officers and
directors to pay expenses,a nomina| cash position,and
no revenue in its most recent quarter. It is not
currently an operating company. The company is going
to need financing. If that financing does not occur,
the company may not be able to continue as a going
concern in which case you could lose your entire
investment. Other risks and uncertainties inc|ude, but
are not |imited to, the ability of the Company to
complete a p|anned bridge financing, market
conditions, the general acceptance of the Company's
products and techno|ogies, competitive factors,
timing, and other risks associated with their
