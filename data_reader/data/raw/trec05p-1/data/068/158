SCALIA VOWS VIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT AS LABOR SOLICITOR

The Bush administration's nominee for the top legal position
at the Labor Department vows that he would "vigorously"
enforce worker protection laws if confirmed, but Democrats
question whether his past views on a host of controversial
labor issues should disqualify him from the position. Eugene
Scalia defends his record on a number of DOL
regulations--including his criticism of the federal effort
to regulate ergonomics in the workplace--but also pledges
that he would abstain from policy areas that would be left
to the labor secretary and the heads of various DOL agencies
if he is confirmed. Scalia, selected in April as President
Bush's choice for labor solicitor, made his comments during
an appearance before the Senate Health, Education, Labor,
and Pensions Committee.

While Republicans attending the confirmation hearing praise
Scalia as uniquely qualified for the post, Democrats, led by
Sen. Kennedy (D-Mass.), express strong reservations about
the nominee. Scalia has come under fire chiefly for his
opposition to the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration's efforts to regulate ergonomics, but also
for his positions on wage and hour regulations and
enforcement of equal employment opportunity statutes. The
committee is set tentatively to vote Oct. 10 on the
nomination. . . . Page AA-1

TRUESDALE STEPS DOWN AS NLRB MEMBER, LEAVING BARE QUORUM

John C. Truesdale, who served in a variety of high-level
capacities during his 45-year career with the National Labor
Relations Board, steps down as a board member, following
through on his resignation submitted last May to President
Bush. The board now has a bare quorum of three members.
Truesdale's most recent stint on the board began in December
1998, when former President Clinton named him to a recess
appointment as chairman. The Senate confirmed Truesdale's
nomination in November 1999. Bush switched the chairmanship
to Peter J. Hurtgen (R) this past May, but Truesdale
continued as a member.

While Truesdale's (D) term does not officially expire until
August 2003, he made a pledge in November 1999 to step down
early and allow the new president to select a replacement.
In a May 24 letter to Bush, Truesdale said his resignation
would be effective when a successor was confirmed or the
president made a recess appointment or by Oct. 1 at the
latest. Bush has not taken action to replace Truesdale or to
fill a Republican seat that has been vacant since late
August 2000. . . . Page A-1

TWO-PRONGED APPROACH TO WORKER AID INCLUDES MINIMUM WAGE, UI
GAINS

Senate Democrats are crafting a two-pronged approach toward
passing a displaced worker assistance package that would
include an expansion of unemployment insurance benefits,
federal reimbursements for health insurance, and an increase
in the minimum wage.

The first set of provisions would be included with an
airport security bill that is expected to come to the Senate
floor Oct. 3 or Oct. 4, Senate Majority Leader Daschle
(D-S.D.) says. The proposal would take the form of a
"narrowly drawn unemployment package," he says, for workers
directly affected by the terrorist attacks.

The second set of provisions would be included in a broad
economic stimulus package currently being discussed with
congressional leaders and the administration. It could
include provisions that would expand the pool of eligible
recipients for new unemployment benefits and increase the
federal minimum wage in "addressing the needs of those who
are unemployed as a result of the slowdown in the economy,"
Daschle says. . . . Page A-13

COURT REJECTS WASTEWATER WORKERS' CHALLENGE TO DRUG-TESTING
PROGRAM

A federal district court in Minnesota throws out a lawsuit
brought by Minneapolis wastewater workers who said the
city's random drug-testing program violated their
constitutional rights against unreasonable searches and
seizures ("Geffre v. Metropolitan Council,  "D. Minn.,  No.
99-CV-715 (JMR/FLN), 9/26/01).

Metropolitan Council, the public agency responsible for
processing wastewater in the Minneapolis-St. Paul
metropolitan area, bargained with the plaintiffs'
union--Local 35 of the International Union of Operating
Engineers--for the policy, and union members consented to
the program by ratifying the collective bargaining
agreement, Judge Rosenbaum of the U.S. District Court for
the District of Minnesota holds. In addition, the policy was
reasonable because the workers held safety-sensitive jobs
and had a diminished expectation of privacy, the court
states. . . . Page A-4

ILO CONVENTION ON CHILD LABOR RATIFIED BY 100 COUNTRIES

The International Labor Organization says the world's
governments have moved "at a record pace" in ratifying a new
global agreement aimed at stamping out the worst forms of
child labor. With ratification by the Baltic state of
Estonia, the number of ILO countries that have ratified the
convention has reached 100, ILO says.

Adopted in June 1999, the convention calls on governments to
ensure that immediate steps are taken to suppress the worst
forms of child labor. The convention applies to children
under the age of 18, and signatories must adopt action
programs and report regularly to the ILO on efforts to
comply with its provisions. It was ratified and put in force
by the United States in November 2000.

Frans Roselaers, director of the ILO's International Program
on the Elimination of Child Labor, says the child labor
convention has achieved the fastest ratification pace of any
convention in the ILO's 82-year history.  . . . Page A-2
