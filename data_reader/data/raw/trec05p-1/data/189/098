<table border=0 width="100%" cellpadding="8"  cellpadding="8"><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">GREETING IN THE NAME OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST. I AM MRS MARIAM LAZ , A WIDOW TO LATE SHEIK LAZ. I AM 61 YEARS OLD, I AM NOW A NEW CHRISTAIN CONVERT, SUFFERING FROM LONG TIME CANCER OF THE BREAST, FROM ALL INDICATION MY CONDITIONS IS REALLY DETERIORATING AND IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT I WON&#8217;T LIVE MORE THAN 3 MONTHS, ACCORDING TO MY DOCTORS, THIS IS BECAUSE THE CANCER STAGE HAS GOTTEN TO A VERY BAD STAGE. MY LATE HUSBAND KILLED DURING THE U.S. RAID AGAINST TERRORISM IN AFGHANISTAN, AND DURING THE PERIOD OF OUR MARRIAGE WE CULD&#8217;NT PRODUCE ANY CHILD.MY LATE HUSBAND WAS VERY WEALTHY AND AFTER HIS DEATH, I INHERITED ALL HIS BUSINESS AND WEALTH. THE DOCTORS HAS ADVISED ME THAT I MAY NOT LIVE FOR MORE THAN 3 MONTHS, SO I NOW DECIDED TO DEVIDE THE PART OF THIS WEALTH, TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHURCH IN AFRICA, AMERICA, ASIA, AND EUROPE. I AM WILLING TO DONATE THE SUM OF $12,000.000.00 MD U.S DOLLARS, TO THE LESS PRIVILEGED.SO I WILL LIKE YOU TO GET THIS FUND AND USE IT TO HELP THE POOR AND THE LESS PRIVILEGED ALL OVER THE WORLD.<BR>&nbsp;I HONESTLY PRAY THAT THIS MONEY WHEN TRANSFERRED WILL BE SURE FOR THE SAID PURPOSE, BECAUSE I HAVE COME TO FIND OUT THAT WEALTH ACQUISITION WITHOUT CHRIST IS VANITY. MAY THE GRACE OF OUR LORD JESUS THE LOVE OF GOD AND THE FELLOWSHIP OF GOD BE WITH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY I AWAIT URGENT REPLY.<BR>YOURS IN CHRIST.<BR>MARIAM LAZ</td></tr></table>
