AWARD-WINNING ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA TO HOLD TEACHING RESIDENCY
The Grammy Award-winning Orpheus Chamber Orchestra will hold a one-day 
teaching residency at the Haas School on November 29th.  Orpheus, the only 
chamber orchestra in the world that consistently rehearses, performs, and 
records without a conductor, has garnered attention from the corporate 
sector for its unique approaches to creativity, innovation, and 
self-management.

Orpheus will showcase its innovative approach to leadership for of a group 
of Haas MBA students on Thursday from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the 
International House auditorium. Tickets to the event were awarded to MBA 
students through a lottery process. Morgan Stanley is sponsoring the event 
at Haas. The firm also sponsored an Orpheus residency at Hitotsubashi 
University in Tokyo in June 2001.

The program will include presentations by Dean Laura Tyson; Harvey Seifter, 
executive director of Orpheus Chamber Orchestra and author of "Leadership 
Ensemble"; lecturer Terry Pearce; and David Pottruck, co-CEO of Charles 
Schwab. John McGeehan, managing director and chief administrative officer 
for Morgan Stanley Japan Limited will also be in attendance.

Central to the distinctive personality of Orpheus is its unusual process of 
sharing and rotating leadership roles. The "Orpheus Process" is built on 
individual responsibility, shared leadership, and workplace democracy. The 
process has enabled the orchestra to unleash the talent, vision, 
creativity, and leadership potential of each member of the group.

For every work, an elected committee of musicians selects a concertmaster 
and each instrumental section chooses a representative.  These chosen 
representatives (the "core group") are responsible for forming the initial 
concept of the piece and developing an overall interpretive approach to the 
music before the entire orchestra comes together to rehearse.  The core 
also structures the rehearsal process for the entire orchestra, which 
provides clear leadership while insuring that every member has a real stake 
in the artistic outcome of every piece performed by the orchestra. The 
results of the process have produced 28 years of sustained excellence at 
the highest level of international accomplishment.

The main focus of the residency at Haas will be to demonstrate the Orpheus 
Process in action as the orchestra rehearses the first movement of Haydn's 
Symphony No. 63 in C Major in "real time," showing by example their work 
process from core preparations to final product. The applications of the 
Orpheus Process to the business world will be framed in the introduction 
and reinforced through a question-and-answer and discussion period with the 
students and presenters.
----------
DEAN TYSON TO DELIVER FINAL STATE OF THE SCHOOL ADDRESS ON WEDNESDAY, 
NOVEMBER 28
Dean Tyson will give the final state of the school address of her tenure as 
dean on November 28. The speech will be given twice that day, once during 
the day at 12:45 p.m. and once in the evening at 7:45 p.m., in the Arthur 
Andersen Auditorium. Dean Tyson will take questions from the audience at 
the end of the speech. All students, faculty, and staff are welcome to attend.

VERY POPULAR "FUNDAMENTALS OF BUSINESS" COURSE OPENS HAAS TO BERKELEY 
GRADUATE STUDENTS
For the first time, the Haas School is offering a graduate-level business 
course specifically designed for non-business school students at UC 
Berkeley who want exposure to fundamental knowledge of management and 
business. "Fundamentals of Business" (BA 296-10) will introduce Berkeley 
graduate students to the basics of business.

So far, the course appears quite popular, with almost every seat taken 
during the pre-enrollment process. Of the 102 students currently 
pre-enrolled, the largest segment (18 students) comes from the College of 
Engineering. The remainder come from a variety of graduate programs at 
Berkeley.

"For years there has been high demand for Haas courses outside the school," 
says Andy Shogan, associate dean for instruction. "Graduate students don't 
have time to take several business courses to learn management, finance, 
and marketing. This course will satisfy that demand and expose the students 
to more topics."

Fundamentals of Business is a broad survey course for graduate students 
designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to the study of business 
and modern management techniques such as data gathering, analysis, and 
decision-making. The class meets in the Arthur Andersen Auditorium on 
Wednesdays from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.

The format of the course is three five-week modules taught by a team of 
instructors with different functional areas of expertise. The modules are:
    "Managing People in Organizations" taught by Nancy Euske,
    "Accounting and Finance" taught by Victor Stanton,
    "Delighting Customers: Marketing and Strategy" taught by David Robinson.

At the end of each of the three modules, there will be an exam on the 
following Monday. The course is open to graduate students only from 
departments other than the Haas School. No prerequisite coursework is 
required, but a familiarity with basic economics is helpful. For more 
information visit http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/~robinson/BA296/.

Haas also offers an undergraduate business survey course, BA 10, which is a 
prerequisite for the business major.

  HAAS JOINS IN LAUNCHING OF NATIONAL ORGANIZATION TO INCREASE WOMEN IN 
BUSINESS LEADERSHIP
A new national nonprofit organization designed to increase the number of 
women business owners and business leaders was announced on November 6 
during the group's first board meeting at the University of Michigan 
Business School. Ilse Evans, executive director of MBA Admissions and 
Career Services, and David Downes, director of the Full-Time MBA program, 
are founding board members.

The organization, whose name and headquarters have yet to be determined, is 
an alliance of educational institutions, businesses, and nonprofit groups. 
The organization will work to increase women's access to education and 
business networks, support women financially in their business education, 
raise awareness of the impact women can make on business and society, and 
encourage and support research on relevant topics.

"One of the key barriers to access to business education is the lack of 
awareness and knowledge women have about the value and flexibility of 
business careers and education," says Jeanne M. Wilt, executive director of 
the new organization and assistant dean for admissions and career 
development at the University of Michigan Business School.

Over the next three years, the organization plans to substantially expand 
its membership of business schools and companies, serve alumnae of member 
schools and develop strategic partnerships with other key organizations 
that work with women and girls.  It aims to raise $20 million by 2004 to 
support its work.

Business members of the new group include Dell, Deloitte Consulting, 
Goldman, Sachs & Co., JP Morgan Chase & Co., Kraft Foods Inc., and Procter 
& Gamble Co.  Academic members are the business schools at Columbia 
University, Dartmouth (Tuck), the University of California Berkeley (Haas), 
the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan, the University of 
Pennsylvania (Wharton), the University of Texas (McCombs), and the 
University of Virginia (Darden). In addition, the Committee of 200 (C200), 
a professional organization of businesswomen, the Consortium for Graduate 
Study in Management, and the University of Michigan Center for the 
Education of Women are members of the founding board.

STAFF NEWS
Scheffy Wins Don Yoder Paper Prize
The American Folklore Society honored Zoe Scheffy, manager of Accounting 
and Personnel Services, with the 2001 Don Yoder Paper Prize at its annual 
meeting. The AFS Folk Belief and Religious Folklife Section chose Scheffy 
for her paper, "Sámi Religion in Art and Museums."

Scheffy's paper, which was presented at the Folklore, Religion, and 
Diversity Politics conference in Alta, Norway in June, 2000, has been 
accepted for publication in an upcoming book drawn from the conference 
proceedings. In the paper she shows how differing approaches to museum 
representation construct subjective and influential visions of Sámi culture 
and traditional spirituality. In particular, she focuses on the display of 
drums and their role in both Sámi identity and outsiders' perceptions of 
the Sámi people. The Sámi are the indigenous people of Scandinavia.

Scheffy received an MA in Folklore from Indiana University, and is 
currently working toward a Ph.D. in Folklore at Indiana, with minors in 
Central Eurasian Studies and Museum Studies. For more information, visit
