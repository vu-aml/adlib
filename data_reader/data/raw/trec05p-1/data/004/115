Don:
How possible would it be to let me have the weekend of August 17th off?  According to the current August schedule I am working that weekend, would it be easier for me to try to arrange a swap with a co worker?
Thanks,
Andrew

Compadres,

Please include PJM EAST HUB on the Shift Note, include On-peak, Off-peak and All-day averages.

The NE boys tell me that the same values are available on the PJM Summary page.

If you have any questions, drop me line or call.

Thank you,
