Mr. Michael Webber
Accounts Dept.
Allied Irish Bank
Bankcentre,P.O.Box 452,
Ballsbridge,
Dublin 4, Ireland.

Dear Friend,

PRIVATE AND URGENT.

I am contacting you in regards to a business transfer of a huge sum of 
money from a deceased's account. Though I know that a transaction of 
this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am 
assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.

We decided to contact you due to the urgency of this claims as
we discovered an abandoned sum of US$20,000,000.00 (Twenty
Million Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign 
customers who died along with his entire family in a plane crash.

Since his death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward
to lay claims to this money as the heir. My associate and I found you to 
be from the same country and with the same surname as our client and we
were in effect compelled to contact you immediately.

We cannot release the funds from his account unless someone applies 
for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our 
banking guidelines. Upon this discovery, we now seek your permission 
to have you stand as a next-of-kin to the deceased as all documentations 
will be carefully worked out by us for the funds (US$20,000,000.00) 
to be released in your favour as the beneficiary's next-of-kin.

It may interest you to note that we have secured from the probate an
order of mandamus to locate any of deceased's beneficiaries. Please
acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our
mutual business endeavour by furnishing me with the following;

1. Your Full name and Physical address.
2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers.
3. Information regarding your date of birth.

These requirements will enable us file a letter of claim to the
appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your favour before
the transfer can be made. We shall be remunerating you with 4 Million
Dollars on final conclusion of this project, while the rest shall be
for us. Your share stays with you while we come over to collect the rest 
from you immediately it hits your nominated account for private investment.

If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of
the trust we have bestowed in you, I await your urgent mail through 
my confidential email address only: michaelwebber_1@hotmail.com

Best regards,

Michael Webber.

Credit Officer, 
AIB Dublin.Ireland.
