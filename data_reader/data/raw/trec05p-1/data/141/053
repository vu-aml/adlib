Peoples Gas has backed down from their request for a letter of credit to provide "Adequate Assurances of Payment", as stated in their tariff.  They will continue to accept a parental guaranty, which is due no later than December 3 (and which Teresa says is being processed).  The amount at issue is about $40k.

However, they are sending me a letter that will say, if there is any further downgrade in our rating, they will immediately require a l/c or cash deposit.
