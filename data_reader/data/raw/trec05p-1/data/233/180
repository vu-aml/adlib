Please see below and let me know if you agree with what I thought I heard was approved from our meeting with Dynegy last Thursday. I have included the 3 Gas Control Items requested as if approved.   If all agree upon this list, I will need to put together a spending schedule by month for each line item to be used in the NNG cash management meetings.  Thanks…cvb
