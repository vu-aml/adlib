OOooohhhhh...just looked at the Surfside cam and its...well, damn. Its ON boys. Go...go now...do not wait. Cancel all evening appointments and go. Wind is 6 mph out of the Northwest...that wont last long.

Report from yesterday...Fished West side of Pelican Island shoreline on point closest to Sand Island  waist deep over shell. Caught 6 on Chart/Orange/blue Top Dog and blue/chart/silver mirrolure. 
LOST THE STAR TOURNEY LEADER TROUT!!!! Blew up on TopDog, got her to hand...I was shaking like a freaking leaf. Made "the grab" she exploded out of my hand, threw the hook, and Top Dog lodged in my shirt!!! 2nd 28´plus trout I've lost on that shoreline in 2 years!!! Then, after I quit shaking and what not, I realized I wasn't even ENTERED in the damn tourney, so I am glad I didn't catch her!!! She was every inch of 28 and fat with hardly any spots. Big, old female. Damn I love fishing.
