Dear Valued Customer,  

At Chase, we're committed to improving your online experience.  
Our customers told us to make Chase Online simpler.  So we did, 
and now it's easier and more convenient than ever to access 
your Chase accounts and conduct transactions online. 

On Saturday, January 19th, we'll be working to convert you to 
the improved Chase Online. When you log on to Chase Online 
after this date, you'll see new features and a new look.  Please 
be assured that all of your information will automatically be 
converted to the new service. There's nothing you need to do. 
  
With the new Chase Online you will enjoy: 
   >One-click access to most functions
   >Easier bill payments
   >Quicker access to your account details

For your convenience, we have created a new "Show Me How" 
tutorial to help you learn how to use most common functions, 
such as paying bills or transferring money.
