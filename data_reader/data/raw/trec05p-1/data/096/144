Internet Daily 
for Tuesday, October 23, 2001
by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com


Yahoo co-opts Explorer

Yahoo introduced Tuesday an application that makes changes to 
the settings of Microsoft's Internet Explorer and gives 
preference to Yahoo's email, search and other tools.

The free download program, Essentials, can make Yahoo's instant 
messaging tool the browser's default choice, as well as add 
links to Yahoo services in the Start menu of a PC running 
Windows. It can also make Yahoo's site the default home page for 
Explorer, and select the online service's email and search 
functions as the primary choice. Yahoo  is offering Essentials 
"in response to user demand," said Henry Sohn, vice president 
and general manager of network services.

AOL, Yahoo, MSN to label sites' content

America Online, Microsoft Corp.'s  MSN and Yahoo have adopted a 
system to label Web sites to help parents prevent children from 
viewing objectionable content. Developed by non-profit trade 
group Internet Content Rating Association, the labeling is 
included in the Web pages' coding, which can be read by Web 
filtering software or browsers.

Content providers including Playboy.com  have also labeled their 
sites; the ICRA began a campaign Tuesday to encourage others to 
do so. "Creating safer places for children to use the Internet 
has long been a part of the overall experience Yahoo provides, 
and working with the industry to develop the ICRA standard and 
labeling protocol is just the next step in our efforts," said 
Srinija Srinivasan, vice president and editor-in-chief.

Net access in airplanes to be delayed

Adding Internet access to airlines' in-flight communications 
systems will take a little longer than expected. But it will 
happen nonetheless, according to a market analysis by Northern 
Sky Research. The Cambridge, Mass.-based consulting firm called 
the concept "viable" and predicted airline user fees for the 
service would total $804 million in 2005. "Prior to the 
terrorist attacks, 12 airlines committed to equipping over 2,100 
of their aircraft with Internet service," said Karekin Jelalian, 
author of the report. "The service has understandably fallen as 
a priority."

-----------------------------------------------------------------
RealOne content providers listed

RealNetworks  said 20 media companies have signed up to provide 
audio and video content for RealOne, the company's subscription 
content service. They include CNet Networks, CNN, and the 
Weather Channel, as well as other content companies that also 
provide material to RealNetworks' current subscription service, 
GoldPass. The RealOne service, set to debut next month, uses new 
software that combines a Web browser and streaming media jukebox 
player.
