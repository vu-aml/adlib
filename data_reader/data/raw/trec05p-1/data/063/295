Rob,

I have some information as it relates to supplying power plants.  For instance my CA Interstate Capacity Report includes several interstate pipeline projects intended to serve these plants.  Kern River has at least 3 projects filed including the High Desert Lateral project which will serve the High Desert Power Project.  

Also some time ago I distributed to Marketing, Regulatory and others a copy of the CEC's Final Draft Report on California's Natural Gas Infrastructure.  This report is still not final however a portion of it includes these seven projects as part of the overall demand basis for additional interstate pipeline capacity.  Virtually the same information was included in the CEC's presentation at the CPUC's own workshop on Natural Gas Infrastructure last April (Jeff F. from Marketing also attended workshop).  

I haven't followed these projects individually at the CEC however I'll call Michele to make sure she has the information listed above and ask her if she needs further assistance in obtaining any other pertinent data.

Rob,
Here are some potential opportunities in California that could be served off PG&E.  I am trying to verify whether these projects are still filed with the CEC.  The meeting is scheduled for next Tuesday at 9:00.  Thanks.
