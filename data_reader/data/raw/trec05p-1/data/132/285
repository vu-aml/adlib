From Eno Christophe

Hello,

Permit me to inform you of my desire of going into business 
relationship with you.

I believe you are a reputable and responsible trustworthy person I can 
do business with and by mater of trust, I must not hesitate to confide 
in you for this simple and sincere business.

I am Eno Christtophe the only child of late Mr. and Mrs Tonye 
Christophe.

My father was a very wealthy cocoa merchant based in Abidjan, the 
economic capital of Cote D'Ivoire before he was poisoned to death by 
his business associates on one of their outing to discuss a business 
deal.

When my mother died on the 21st October 1984, my father took me so 
special because I am moteherless.

Before the death of my father on 24th November 2003 in a private 
hospital in Abidjan, he secretly called me on his bed side and told me 
that during the war in my country, he moved the sum of US$30,600,000 
(Thirty Million Six Hundred thousand United States 
Dollars) and deposited with a security company abroad.

Before his death, his last words was that I sould move to Ghana where 
his enemis will not know my where about then from Ghana that I must 
find any possible means of moving out and naturalize in a foreign 
country where I can put up solid investment with the money so that I 
will not lack anything as his only daughter.

Now, I am staying here in a village  in Kumasi Ghana with a teacher and 
his family of 4. Though they are poor but caring.

My father's desire is that I seek for a foreign partner in a country of 
my choice where I will transfer this money and use it for investment 
purposes, (Such as Real Estate management).

To fulfil my father's dream for me by moving out of my country, I am 
honourably seeking your assistance in the following way:

(1) To serve as the guardian of this fund

(2) assist me in putting this sum of money in safe keeping by accepting 
to clear it from the security company with a letter of authority from 
me.

(3) to make arrangement for me to come over to your country to further 
my education and to secure a residential permit for me in your country.

Moreover, I am willing to offer you 20% of the total sum as 
compensation for your efforts/input after the successful conclusion of 
this transaction.

Furthermore, you can indicate your option towards assisting me as I 
believe that this transaction would be concluded within a few days you 
signify interest to assist me.

Anticipating hearing from you immediately. Thanks and God bless you.

Eno.
