Energy Committee Members:

We have been offered an opportunity to benefit from a unique federal funding
program.  Sure Power has been funded to implement distributed generation
(DG) into a high-availability, energy-intensive application in the data
communications industry (i.e. telecom hotel, financial processing center,
internet data center, etc.).  As you know, Sure Power is the world's leading
supplier of DG-based systems providing six 9's availability (certified by
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology).  Sure Power's patented
technology eliminates interconnection issues with the utility, which has
been one of the technical inhibitors to widespread adoption of DG.

Sure Power has already aligned themselves with EPRI to assist them with
measurement and analysis, but are looking for a partner who has a potential
project on the horizon that could benefit from Sure Power's technology and
federal funding assistance (as much as $3M).  Please note, the project does
not have to be past the internal approval stage to benefit.  Even a
potential project that is still being analyzed for viability could receive
funding for an initial feasibility study.  Understanding that the high-tech
industry is going through trying times, and that many projects have been put
on hold; Sure Power has a three-year window in which to apply the funds, so
even a project that may not start for eighteen months would work.

The deadline in which to finalize their project package is September 12, so
Sure Power would need to have a response from a potential partner no later
than COB Tuesday September 4.  Feel free to contact Sure Power directly with
any questions.
