ARE YOU A BITCH????? 
Some friends were sitting at the bar talking about their professions. 
The first guy says "I'm a Y.U.P.P.I.E, you know.... 
Young, Urban, Professional, Peaceful; Intelligent; Ecologist" 
The second guy says "I'm a D.I.N.K, you know.... 
Double Income, No Kids." 
The third guy says, "I'm a R.U.B., you know... 
Rich, Urban, Biker." 
They turn to the woman and ask her, "What are you?" 
She replies: "I'm a WIFE, you know.... 
Wash, Iron, F***, Etc." 
A second gal answers their question before they even ask it: 
"BITCH "So, just exactly what is a BITCH??????????" They ask in unison. 
* B- BABE 
* I- IN 
* T- TOTAL 
* C- CONTROL of 
* H- HERSELF 
> 
So ladies, next time somebody calls you "Bitch"...SMILE......and say Thank 
You!!!!!!!! 
MAKE A WOMAN HAPPY! 
PASS THIS ONE ON TO AS MANY WOMEN AS YOU KNOW!
