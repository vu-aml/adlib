Since his death=2C none of his next-of-kin are alive to make claims for this money as his heir=2C because they all died in the same accident=28May his soul rest in peace=29=2E We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines=2E 

Upon this discovery=2C I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased=2C as all documentations will be carefully worked out by a lawyer for the funds Twenty- five million United States dollars =28US$25=2C000=2C000=2E00=29 in a domiciliary account to be released in your favour as the beneficiary's next of kin=2E 
 
Because after six years the money will be called back to the bank treasury as unclaimed bills and the money shared amongst the directors of the bank=2E so it is on this note i decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin=2Fbeneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to share this money amongst themselves at the end of the year=2E 
It may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries=2E

I shall be compensating you with 25% of the total sum on final 
conclusion of this project for your assistance=2C as I have also thought of doling out 5% to charity organisation from your locality based on your recommendation another 5% for the services of the lawyer while the balance 65% shall be for me for investment purposes in your country as I cannot bring back this cash to my country=2E
