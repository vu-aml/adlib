Well hello again JLH-OBRs 

I have been inspired to put this OBR questionnaire on my computer and now am emailing to you to fill out and return to me. 

I am sending it as a Word document.  I can also save as WordPerfect or Unicode, if you need that.  Just let me know. 

Many thanks, Tami Grubb
