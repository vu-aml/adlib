Ah...mouth meat. Sounds like that needs to be added to the menu along
with the heart and other various and sundry entrails. Raw or cooked...it
JUST DOESN'T MATTER.

I'll take care of all Henry items on my own. (Milk, hot dogs/boca 
burger/juice) Just make sure there is a loaf of bread so I can make him 
peanut butter sandwiches.
Pecan Pie?? yes.
Fruit?? a half dozen good apples.
Skip the baileys (i'm sure joe will agree) there may be some left.
No need for gatorade, water and beer and scotch is all i need. No juice,
we 
can steal some of Henry's.
