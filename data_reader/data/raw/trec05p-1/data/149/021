Performance-Based Ratemaking Conference

December 5-7, 2001, Denver, CO

OVERVIEW

 

Performance Based Ratemaking (PBR) is emerging as a key element of the restructuring of the electric utility industry. For PBR to be effective it must be designed carefully and uniquely for each utility so as to align the interests of the utility, the shareholders and the customers and also to make sure that PBR is successful in achieving efficiency and service quality.

 

EUCI has put together a covey of expert speakers to review and address the latest PBR developments and applications.  Join us in Denver and get the latest state-of-the-art information and insights you will need to develop an effective PBR strategy for your company.

Electric Power Market Performance Conference

December 12-14, 2001, Denver, CO

OVERVIEW

 

Each year there is additional opportunity to draw lessons regarding electricity market structure and design from actual market performance. These lessons are leading to a convergence in market design, at least in the Eastern Interconnection and ERCOT. One focus of this conference will be on the lessons to be drawn from the experience of the new ERCOT markets, the continuing market design problems in California, and the difficulties in developing and implementing a market based congestion management system in the midwest.

 

A second focus of this conference will be on the existing markets in PJM and New York, which have now moved beyond managing their internal markets and are being pushed by market participants and regulatory agencies to better address inter-RTO coordination and develop market based incentive systems for transmission expansion.

 

Finally, the conference will highlight one of the important, but little noticed successes of the Eastern ISOs, which is the explosive growth in the PJM and New York financial rights auctions.

Transmission Expansion and Systems in Transition Conference

Feb. 6-7, 2002, Miami, Florida

OVERVIEW

This conference will examine the business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC's RTO initiatives.  The conference will review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and regional trading system.
