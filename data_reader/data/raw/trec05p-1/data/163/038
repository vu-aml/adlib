Don,


I represent a firm which has specialized in executive and technical
placement for over ten years.  I believe I can assist you in your career
search due to the fact that I'm currently working with several organizations
looking for individuals with backgrounds similar to yours.  I'd like
to schedule a ten minute telephone conversation to discuss your needs and
wants to better determine whether or not we may have any potential matches.

Please reply or call me at 630-990-7510 at your earliest convenience.  I
look forward to speaking with you soon.
