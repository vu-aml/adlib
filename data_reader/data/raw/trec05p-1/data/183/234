Investment ideas 
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
The decade ahead for e-business
Sell-side solutions may be the wave of the near-term future

By Steve Butler, senior analyst, eMarketer

At the Line56 conference held recently in New York, one of the 
most upbeat perspectives on the future of e-business came from 
Tom Thomas, current CEO and chairman of Haht Commerce, and 
former CIO of Dell Computer (DELL) during the 1990s.

Taking the long-term view of e-business over the next decade, 
Thomas compared the current economic climate in 2001 to that of 
1991--a time when the United States was in the middle of a 
recession, but at the beginning of a decade when the deployment 
of new technologies would bring immense opportunity for growth.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Broadband goes mainstream
That sound you hear may be media finally streaming and screaming 
through fat pipes

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

Who needs a race car when the local speed limits are 10 miles per hour? 
That was the lesson learned by many Internet-oriented business models 
that delivered services geared towards high-speed access, only to find 
that most surfers were still connected to the Web by a dowdy 56K dial-
up modem. The promise of (high-speed) broadband connections has been 
so slow to materialize that many start-ups ran out of cash before ever 
garnering a large audience. Entire sectors, such as Web-based animation, 
have come and gone.

But just as the hype has cooled, it now looks like the promise of 
broadband may finally be realized as we head into 2002. Penetration 
rates are rising again, and could soon reach the critical mass necessary to 
make broadband a mainstream technology. Roughly 10.7 million U.S. 
households now have broadband access, representing about 16 percent of 
all households online, according to research firm the Yankee Group. 
That's up some 60 percent from 12 months ago.
