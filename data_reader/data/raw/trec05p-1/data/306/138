Houston's Energy Market Down but Not Out  <http://hsweb01.screamingmedia.com/PMA/pma_newsarticle1_krt.htm?SMDOCID=knightridder_2002_06_23_krtbn_0000-0041-HO-ENERGY-TRADING&SMContentSet=0>

June 24 -- Not so long ago, you could stand at the now infamous tilted E downtown and look north down Electricity Alley -- the thriving nexus of some of world's biggest energy trading companies. These days, that stretch is more like a row of steel and glass dominoes in danger of being tipped by the fall of the E logo's namesake: Enron Corp. Energy companies that were proud to show off fast-growing operations and glitzy new trading floors are now cutting deeply and concentrating on tangible assets, such as pipelines and power plants. A rush to convince investors they're not the next Enron is taking it's toll on the people who held the high-pressure, high-paying jobs on the trading floors of those downtown skyscrapers.

Better Nuclear, Power Defenses Needed -U.S. Report <http://hsweb01.screamingmedia.com/PMA/pma_newsarticle1_reuters.htm?SMDOCID=reuters_pma_2002_06_24_eng-reuters_pma_BETTER-NUCLEAR-POWER-DEFENSES-NEEDED-U-S-REPORT&SMContentSet=0> 

June 24 -- The United States needs to get moving to protect nuclear plants and the power grid against future attacks and may need to reorganize the way government agencies work together, top scientists said on Monday. The country also has "enormous vulnerabilities" to a chemical or biological attack, made clear after the Sept. 11 attacks, said a report from the National Academy of Sciences, an independent organization that advises the government. One top priority will be working with Russia to keep track of nuclear weapons and radioactive material that could be used either in a nuclear attack, or in a "dirty bomb" that would spread radioactive toxins using a conventional blast.

Enron Used Reserves To Hide Profits <http://hsweb01.screamingmedia.com/PMA/pma_newsarticle1_reuters.htm?SMDOCID=reuters_pma_2002_06_23_eng-reuters_pma_ENRON-USED-RESERVES-TO-HIDE-PROFITS-NYT&SMContentSet=0>

June 24 -- Enron Corp. used hidden reserves to conceal up to $1.5 billion in trading profits during the California power crisis, six former executives and managers told the New York Times. In its Sunday edition, the paper said the reserves would have doubled the now-bankrupt energy trader's profits during the California energy crisis in late 2000 and early 2001, at a time when politicians were accusing energy companies of profiteering and market manipulation. Houston-based Enron also manipulated the reserves -- which held anywhere from $800 million to $2 billion at times -- to report steady profit growth, according to some former executives, the Times said.

Arizona Blaze So Far Spares Transmission Grid  <http://hsweb01.screamingmedia.com/PMA/pma_newsarticle1_reuters.htm?SMDOCID=reuters_pma_2002_06_24_eng-reuters_pma_ARIZONA-BLAZE-SO-FAR-SPARES-TRANSMISSION-GRID&SMContentSet=0>

June 24 -- Arizona's main electric utilities said Monday the largest wildfire in the state's history so far has not burned into the transmission grid carrying power to the Phoenix and Tucson areas. Arizona Public Service, the utility subsidiary of Pinnacle West Corp. ((PNW.N)), and the Salt River Project, a public power utility, said the fire that has blackened more than 322,000 acres (130,000 hectares) in Arizona's eastern high country has burned close to two 500-kilovolt power lines but they were still operating as of early today. The vast blaze, which started last Tuesday, has come to within 1-1/2 miles of a high-voltage line that runs from the Cholla power station in St. Joseph City to the Saguaro power plant north of Tucson, said Damon Gross, a spokesman for Arizona Public Service.

  
	
	
 	 
Mergers: In Sickness and in Health  <http://hsweb01.screamingmedia.com/PMA/pma_newsarticle1_national.htm?SMDOCID=Scientech_2002_06_24_1024952614020&SMContentSet=0>

Scientech -- June 24 -- Potomac Electric Power Company and Conectiv, announced that the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities voted to approve the merger of the two companies. Today's action leaves approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the last necessary to complete the merger. The merger, proposed in February 2001, has received approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and has cleared review by the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice. Delaware and the District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia had previously approved the merger. Dennis Wraase, Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco) president and chief operating officer said, "This is a key milestone in the completion of the Pepco-Conectiv merger. With the final state approval now in place, the way is cleared for the SEC to act. We are excited about moving to this final stage, as we believe the merger offers significant benefits for customers, shareholders and employees." Analysis: When Pepco and Conectiv decided to merge, they wanted to create the largest electricity-delivery company in the mid-Atlantic region with a transmission network serving 1.8 million customers in a 10,000 square-mile area. 

Energy Risk - Australia Risking Millions In Income By Not Signing Climate Change Protocol  <http://hsweb01.screamingmedia.com/PMA/pma_newsarticle1_national.htm?SMDOCID=RiskCenter.com_2002_06_24_1024952527612&SMContentSet=0>

RiskCenter.com -- June 24 -- Australia is risking hundreds of millions of dollars in export income by not signing the Kyoto protocol on climate change, according to the Australian EcoGeneration Association (AEA). AEA, a peak group for renewable energy and energy-efficient generators, says figures provided by federal and New South Wales research show that Australia will be only 5 per cent or less over its Kyoto target by 2008 when the protocol takes effect. As a result, abatement measures to reduce greenhouse gas to 108 per cent of 1990 levels by 2008 would not be costly, AEA says. NSW recently announced measures to cut per capita greenhouse emissions by 5 per cent of 1990 levels in 2006.

Houston's Energy Market Down but Not Out  <http://hsweb01.screamingmedia.com/PMA/pma_newsarticle1_krt.htm?SMDOCID=knightridder_2002_06_23_krtbn_0000-0041-HO-ENERGY-TRADING&SMContentSet=0>

June 24 -- Not so long ago, you could stand at the now infamous tilted E downtown and look north down Electricity Alley -- the thriving nexus of some of world's biggest energy trading companies. These days, that stretch is more like a row of steel and glass dominoes in danger of being tipped by the fall of the E logo's namesake: Enron Corp. Energy companies that were proud to show off fast-growing operations and glitzy new trading floors are now cutting deeply and concentrating on tangible assets, such as pipelines and power plants. A rush to convince investors they're not the next Enron is taking it's toll on the people who held the high-pressure, high-paying jobs on the trading floors of those downtown skyscrapers.

Better Nuclear, Power Defenses Needed -U.S. Report <http://hsweb01.screamingmedia.com/PMA/pma_newsarticle1_reuters.htm?SMDOCID=reuters_pma_2002_06_24_eng-reuters_pma_BETTER-NUCLEAR-POWER-DEFENSES-NEEDED-U-S-REPORT&SMContentSet=0> 

June 24 -- The United States needs to get moving to protect nuclear plants and the power grid against future attacks and may need to reorganize the way government agencies work together, top scientists said on Monday. The country also has "enormous vulnerabilities" to a chemical or biological attack, made clear after the Sept. 11 attacks, said a report from the National Academy of Sciences, an independent organization that advises the government. One top priority will be working with Russia to keep track of nuclear weapons and radioactive material that could be used either in a nuclear attack, or in a "dirty bomb" that would spread radioactive toxins using a conventional blast.

Enron Used Reserves To Hide Profits <http://hsweb01.screamingmedia.com/PMA/pma_newsarticle1_reuters.htm?SMDOCID=reuters_pma_2002_06_23_eng-reuters_pma_ENRON-USED-RESERVES-TO-HIDE-PROFITS-NYT&SMContentSet=0>

June 24 -- Enron Corp. used hidden reserves to conceal up to $1.5 billion in trading profits during the California power crisis, six former executives and managers told the New York Times. In its Sunday edition, the paper said the reserves would have doubled the now-bankrupt energy trader's profits during the California energy crisis in late 2000 and early 2001, at a time when politicians were accusing energy companies of profiteering and market manipulation. Houston-based Enron also manipulated the reserves -- which held anywhere from $800 million to $2 billion at times -- to report steady profit growth, according to some former executives, the Times said.

Arizona Blaze So Far Spares Transmission Grid  <http://hsweb01.screamingmedia.com/PMA/pma_newsarticle1_reuters.htm?SMDOCID=reuters_pma_2002_06_24_eng-reuters_pma_ARIZONA-BLAZE-SO-FAR-SPARES-TRANSMISSION-GRID&SMContentSet=0>

June 24 -- Arizona's main electric utilities said Monday the largest wildfire in the state's history so far has not burned into the transmission grid carrying power to the Phoenix and Tucson areas. Arizona Public Service, the utility subsidiary of Pinnacle West Corp. ((PNW.N)), and the Salt River Project, a public power utility, said the fire that has blackened more than 322,000 acres (130,000 hectares) in Arizona's eastern high country has burned close to two 500-kilovolt power lines but they were still operating as of early today. The vast blaze, which started last Tuesday, has come to within 1-1/2 miles of a high-voltage line that runs from the Cholla power station in St. Joseph City to the Saguaro power plant north of Tucson, said Damon Gross, a spokesman for Arizona Public Service.

  
	
	
 	 
Mergers: In Sickness and in Health  <http://hsweb01.screamingmedia.com/PMA/pma_newsarticle1_national.htm?SMDOCID=Scientech_2002_06_24_1024952614020&SMContentSet=0>

Scientech -- June 24 -- Potomac Electric Power Company and Conectiv, announced that the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities voted to approve the merger of the two companies. Today's action leaves approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the last necessary to complete the merger. The merger, proposed in February 2001, has received approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and has cleared review by the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice. Delaware and the District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia had previously approved the merger. Dennis Wraase, Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco) president and chief operating officer said, "This is a key milestone in the completion of the Pepco-Conectiv merger. With the final state approval now in place, the way is cleared for the SEC to act. We are excited about moving to this final stage, as we believe the merger offers significant benefits for customers, shareholders and employees." Analysis: When Pepco and Conectiv decided to merge, they wanted to create the largest electricity-delivery company in the mid-Atlantic region with a transmission network serving 1.8 million customers in a 10,000 square-mile area. 

Energy Risk - Australia Risking Millions In Income By Not Signing Climate Change Protocol  <http://hsweb01.screamingmedia.com/PMA/pma_newsarticle1_national.htm?SMDOCID=RiskCenter.com_2002_06_24_1024952527612&SMContentSet=0>

RiskCenter.com -- June 24 -- Australia is risking hundreds of millions of dollars in export income by not signing the Kyoto protocol on climate change, according to the Australian EcoGeneration Association (AEA). AEA, a peak group for renewable energy and energy-efficient generators, says figures provided by federal and New South Wales research show that Australia will be only 5 per cent or less over its Kyoto target by 2008 when the protocol takes effect. As a result, abatement measures to reduce greenhouse gas to 108 per cent of 1990 levels by 2008 would not be costly, AEA says. NSW recently announced measures to cut per capita greenhouse emissions by 5 per cent of 1990 levels in 2006.
