Hi Chris,

Here is a briefing from my phone conversation with Mike Kim regarding the
usage reports.  Mike will give us more details when he gets back on Tuesday.


California Usage Extract

MDA 2.1 is the new meter database which contains extracted information from
the Cheop System, CSC system and updated position.  

Mike may have data from 1999-2000 and will be contacting us with this
information on Tuesday 9/11.   Per Mike, the 98-99 deals have no specified
baseline, they must be taken at face value.  

National Usage Extract (i.e. Arch Diocese of Chicago, MultiFiber Glass)

The National Usage data is extracted from the Fazer Database


Also, I left Dennis a message regarding the 80-85% of the Discount Frozen
Tariff vs the18,000 power deals in RPS.  I have not heard from him yet.

Thanks,

Annie
