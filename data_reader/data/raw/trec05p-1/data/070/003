Attached is our Channel Marketing Letter that we are using for EOL software initiatives - previsously referred to as Project Offline.  The attached is specific for Deloitte Consulting and has been reviewed and approved by me.  

So that we can maintain a complete file (including computer files), I am forwarding this to you to update (i.e., correct date), print, have me initial and have it signed by Brad Richter.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.
