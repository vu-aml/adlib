I started here and I didn't read the rest of the many posts.

I tried this too under a variety of database and I think it comes down to
this:
You can't fork and network or other type of connection and expect
reality to remain continuous.

If I create an object that has a reference to single point in network
sockets (port number, unix socket) and I try to fork it...  What happens
to the network connections?

I can't get this to work under Oracle, Postgresql either.

I found I have to create/connect the $dbh AFTER fork().
