Joe and Vicki:  As we discussed, attached is the article that appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer this morning regarding the civil complaint filed against Joseph F. Doody, who is currently Eastern Region President and a Director of Limbach Facility Services, Inc.  I received this Article from our local counsel at Schnader Harrison in Philadelphia.  Let me know if there is anything I should do.  Marty
