The VP for this group has requested they be moved in the morning, however for business reasons, this one employee  needs to wait until afternoon. The churn request number is 12116.

Thanks.

Ruthann, Kim wanted me to ask you to make sure that I have a phone in the mornings for business.  Calls taper off after lunch, but I do need ext. 37610 to be live from 7:00a.m. to 12:00p.m. for every day next week.

Thanks,

TK

Your move has been scheduled for next Thursday, 3/14. All moves now take place during the day.

I'll deliver your pre-printed labels as soon as I get them from the Move Team, hopefully today. Please make sure to label everything that needs to be moved.

Call me if you have any questions.
