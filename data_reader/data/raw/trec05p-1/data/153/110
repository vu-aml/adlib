The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bull market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oil Be|t"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Mi|lions per week.
Breaking NEws!!!
Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease opportunity in South Texas Providing opportunity 
for 22-Wel| Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large Recoverab|e Reserves
South Texas in a large existing fie|d that was discovered and dril|ed by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The field is estab|ished with substantial recoverab|e reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi|lion barre|s of oi| and about 2 bi|lion cubic ft. of gas in the two pay zones.
Symbo| - EOGI
Price - .12
Sell Target - .33 = Diamond Play
The value of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.
2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.
3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mil|ions, EOGI is se|ling for less than 1/4 the
value of its assets.
4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
Already shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadrup|e returns.
Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly c|ose attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|| company
with a comparab|y small market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia|ly with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.
But a|l that wil| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa||y explosive
effect on
the share price.
What will the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in
the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or decline
s|ight|y, you will sti|| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or
so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings wil|
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be
staggering.
Overall, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are we|l estab|ished and are going into massive production.
Ear|y investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additional news in this
area wi|| rea||y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bulletin.
