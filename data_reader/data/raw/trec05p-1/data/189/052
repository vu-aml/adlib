Write Stuff
We love to spotlight emails we get from seasoned users of Visor handhelds, but it's also great fun to hear from our newest customers like Angela P., who just got her Visor handheld over the holidays.

From a Visor Newbie
This little doozy has to be the greatest invention of all time. I just wanted to send you an email and let you know how much I love it! I ordered it on-line before Thanksgiving and got it shortly thereafter.

It's amazing how much information you can have at your fingertips! Two things that I've done with it so far is added my vehicle info to my Memo pad (maintenance records / insurance info) to a category called CARS. (So the next time I take my car in for an oil change and they say, "When was the last time you replaced your air filter," I'll be like, "Well, funny that you ask because I've got that info right here." Love that!!

Also, I love the capability to have all of my health insurance info at my fingertips. I made a category on my Memo pad and included info like who my insurance is for dental, health, vision, plus my doctors names, numbers, etc... not to mention that I've got numbers, addresses, and email info for everyone. And that handy little calendar from Outlook that reminds me of stuff-all at my fingertips! I'm just learning about all the capabilities, but so far, I think IT'S FABULOUS! I'm telling everyone I know to get one!

Thanks again!
Angela P.

"Handspring isn't lying when they say that the Treo is a new category of portable device. They call the Treo a 'communicator.' You can call it a nearly perfect melding of a Palm OS PDA and a GSM cellular world phone." (Gary Krakow)

Write Stuff
We love to spotlight emails we get from seasoned users of Visor handhelds, but it's also great fun to hear from our newest customers like Angela P., who just got her Visor handheld over the holidays.

From a Visor Newbie
This little doozy has to be the greatest invention of all time. I just wanted to send you an email and let you know how much I love it! I ordered it on-line before Thanksgiving and got it shortly thereafter.

It's amazing how much information you can have at your fingertips! Two things that I've done with it so far is added my vehicle info to my Memo pad (maintenance records / insurance info) to a category called CARS. (So the next time I take my car in for an oil change and they say, "When was the last time you replaced your air filter," I'll be like, "Well, funny that you ask because I've got that info right here." Love that!!

Also, I love the capability to have all of my health insurance info at my fingertips. I made a category on my Memo pad and included info like who my insurance is for dental, health, vision, plus my doctors names, numbers, etc... not to mention that I've got numbers, addresses, and email info for everyone. And that handy little calendar from Outlook that reminds me of stuff-all at my fingertips! I'm just learning about all the capabilities, but so far, I think IT'S FABULOUS! I'm telling everyone I know to get one!

Thanks again!
Angela P.
