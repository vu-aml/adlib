> Last evening, Commissioner Wood released his alternate to Commissioner
> Bilas' Revised Proposed Decision in the Natural Gas Strategy case.
> Commissioner Wood's alternate rejects the Comprehensive Settlement
> Agreement, which would unbundled SoCalGas' intrastate transmission
system,
> and approves the Interim Settlement proposal, which would make minor
> changes to SoCalGas' windowing procedures, establish hector Road as an
> alternate receipt point, and establish pools for gas trading, among
other
> minor changes.  However, Commissioner Wood's alternate goes further,
> rejecting the unbundling of core interstate transportation from rates
and
> eliminating completely the core's contribution to ITCS (interstate
> transportation cost surcharges), which cost the core approximately
$7-10
> Million per year.
> 
> I'll forward a copy of the alternate to you as soon as it is
available.
