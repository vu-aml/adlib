Due to the unprecedent events of September 11, 2001 NG Risk Desks have requested that Exchange and Options prices for the September 10, 2001 be copied for 
Tuesday, September 11, 2001. There were a few trade prices posted in ERMS prior to the closing of the Market on yesterday. Those prices were futures prices only, and 
were not changed. There were no options prices for the 11th and therefore the 10th prices for options were copied for the 11th. Francis Lim (manager, ERMS IT) made 
these changes per my request. It is my understanding that if exchange and options prices are not available from the Market today, September 12, 2001, Enron traders will  
provide rates to be posted to the various commodities Risk Desks. If there are any changes in these instructions, please contact me @ 3-9226 or Francis Lim @ 3-5906.

Thanks,  wlh
