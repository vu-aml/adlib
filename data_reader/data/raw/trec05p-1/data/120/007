'New' Napster growth 'astounding'

Consumers transferred 1.81 billion digital media files using the 
Kazaa, MusicCity and Grokster file-sharing applications during 
October, according to industry analysts at Webnoize. Each of the 
Web sites uses software licensed from FastTrack, a technology 
company based in Amsterdam. By contrast, an estimated 1.57 
million people were using Napster simultaneously in February, 
while the FastTrack network clocked in last month with 1.3 
million. "During the last four months the number of users 
typically logged on has risen by 480%, and in November will 
likely surpass Napster at its peak," said Webnoize senior 
analyst Matt Bailey. "The growth of the FastTrack network 
continues to be astounding."

Aerie to revive Ricochet

Aerie Networks will restart the bankrupt Ricochet wireless 
broadband service, but it didn't say when. Denver-based Aerie 
announced Monday that it agreed to buy the assets of Metricom 
Inc. for $8.25 million -- a mere fraction of the system's $1 
billion cost. Before Metricom's financial demise, Ricochet 
provided wireless data coverage in 17 cities and had 51,000 
subscribers, according to Aerie president Mort Aaronson. "In 
order to bring it back, we will create partnerships to provide 
the service at a new lower price point than previously offered 
and make it available to millions of users where they buy other 
related products and services," Aaronson said.

Roebuck & Co., Procter & Gamble, and Pepsi-Cola USA. "John is an 
exceptional marketing executive with the depth and breadth of 
experience necessary to lead Yahoo's global marketing team," 
said Greg Coleman, the Net giant's executive vice president of 
North American operations, in a statement.
