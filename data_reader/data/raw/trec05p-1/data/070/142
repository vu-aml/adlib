Directors & Officers Liability : 
How Do You Protect Your Company's Management and Board in a Changing
Environment?
The downturn in the economy, especially among technology companies, and the
recent tragic events in New York have created new challenges for corporate
counsel and risk managers who are charged with protecting their companies'
officers and directors from liability. This program will focus on the
principal liability threat, securities litigation, and the shield for that
threat, Directors & Officers Liability Insurance: 

1) Securities Litigation : How has the landscape changed, what are the
allegations, who are the targets, and what is the effect on damages and
settlements?

2) Directors & Officers Liability Insurance : What is the current state of
the market, what recent changes in coverage have occurred, how will these
changes affect your company, and what can you do about them?
