DEAR RESPECTABLE ONE,

MY NAME IS MADAM HASSINA FAHN, A LIBERIAN NATIONAL AND WIFE
TO THE LATE CAPT. JERRY FAHN THE FORMER PAERSONAL ASSISTANT
TO THE LIBERIAN PRESIDENT MR CHARLES TAYLOR WHO IS
PRESENTLY ON EXILE NOW IN NIGERIA.

DURING THE LAST DAYS OF THE REGIME OF FORMER PRESIDENT
TAYLOR, MY HUSBAND WAS IN CHARGE OF MOST OF THE SECURITY
DEPOSITS AND FUNDS WITHIN THE PRESIDENTIAL VILLA AND AS
SUCH HE WAS THE REAL TARGET IN PLANNED ASSASINATION ATTEMPT
ON THE PRESIDENT THEN WHICH LEFT HIM WITH SERIOUS GUN SHOT
WOUNDS WHICH LED TO HIS EVENTUAL DEATH A FEW DAYS LATER.

BEFORE THE DEATH OF MY HUSBAND, HE CALLED ME PRIVATELY ON
HIS SICK BED AND INFORMED ME OF SOME DEPOSITS  WHICH HE
MADE USING THE COVERAGE OF THE PRESIDENCY THEN IN A
SECURITY COMPANY OUTSIDE OUR COUNTRY TO THE TUNE OF
$35,000,000.00 ( THIRTY FIVE MILLION US DOLLARS ONLY).

THIS MONEY WAS DEPOSITED IN A TRUNK BOX UNDER THE COVERAGE
THAT THEY ARE PRIVATE DOCUMENTS AND JEWELRIES BELONGING TO
A FOREIGN PARTNER WHICH CAN ONLY BE CLAIMED BY HIM OR
THROUGH THE AUTHORISATION OF HIS NEXT OF KIN WHICH IS ME
HIS WIFE IN THE EVENT OF THE UNKNOWN.

AS IT STANDS TILL THIS VERY MOMENT, THE SECURITY COMPANY
DOES NOT KNOW THAT THE CONSIGNMENT CONTAINS MONEY AND ALSO
WITH THE PROBLEMS THE FORMER PRESIDENT CHARLES TAYLOR IS
CURRENTLY FACING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ON WAR
CRIMES ,I SEE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEEEK FOR AN HONEST
GOD FEARING FELLOW TO ASSIST ME TO CLAIM THE CONSIGNMENT
AND INVEST  THE FUNDS OUT SIDE AFRICA.

I AM READY TO GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS IF I GET A POSITIVE
RESPONSE FROM YOU AND PLEASE I AM BEGGING YOU TO KEEP ALL
INFORMATION RELATING TO THIS TRANSACTION AS TOP SECRET AS
NO OTHER PERSON KNOWS ABOUT IT EXCEPT NOW THAT I DECIDED TO
SEEK HELP FROM YOU.

MAY GOD RICHLY BLESS YOU.

YOURS SINCERELY,

MADAM H. FAHN 

enclosed is my int passport for your records and to show my
seriousness
