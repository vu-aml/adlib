Subject:  Copper


After careful consideration and discussions with the dispatchers, I
decided to leave Copper on for Friday night 8/18.  There were several
reasons for this decision including the PV outage,  the fact that,
Newman 1 was only released for 32 megawatts, and the fact that when we
needed Copper last night during the PV outage they had problems bringing
it up.  I felt that from a reliability standpoint it was probably the
right thing to due given those factors.  If either of you have any
questions or concerns regarding this matter please feel free to contact
me.  Thanks --GUZ
