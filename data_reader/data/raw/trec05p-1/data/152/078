I think for December we should leave it as is while we see what the fallout is going to be. But, if we do not have plans to build by year-end, it probably should go to Corp vacant.  ROD, do you agree?

And by the way...do we want to keep it that way for EB 41 or do we want to switch to another category (Corp vacant) since you guys are not using that floor?  What do you think, Pam?

Ruthann,

In October and November,  the billing for the entire 41st floor was taken to 0366/111718 per management's direction while under reconstruction.

To my knowledge, that is still the case.

Please contact, Deborah Bubenko regarding construction completion.

Thank you.

Jo Ann

The October EPSC invoice showed the following floor space being billed incorrectly to 0366/111692:

Room #		Should be billed to		Sq. ft	
ECN 4106		0366/112476		547

ECN 4751		0366/112476		314

Also on their October invoice, there is an entry for rent correction for 1154 sq.ft. The ticket number is EBR10019310085, dated 10/17/01. I looked at all my rent corrections submitted, and it isn't one of mine. Could you please advise what rooms this correction covers?

Thanks for your help.
