the American Chambers of Commerce and Tourism, due I did not disclose 
to her my humble intention for an honest foreigner like you, Having 
noted the confidence reposed on your person by the sponsor of the 
recommendation, My late client was as well a one time secret Agent in 
transferring of money overseas for the late head of state of Nigeria {GENERAL 
SANI ABACHA }.
