Greetings:

For tonight,   Frontera is long 85mw's hour ending 2300.    We need to sell this under the Teco Services book.


For tomorrow Frontera needs to sell:

hour ending  4 - 30 mw's
hour ending 5 -30 mw's
Enter a purchase from Frontera (Teco services book) enter the same price as you sold for.
Enter the sale (Teco Services).

I am also selling Frontera 200 mw's for hour ending 7 and 50 mw's hour ending 8.
I am selling this position for $26.04.       I will be short the Imbalance price during this time. 
If you can buy below $26.04 for this time period,  do so and schedule to load  in the South.       

I am long into the North Zone as follows :
he 1-6,    40 mw's
he 23&24,   55mw's

I am long under deal #834600
If prices appear to weaken,  sell these mw's for 1-6 and cut this Ercot Imbalance deal by same.    This deals should be listed under Ercot Asset.


Thanks,
JMF
