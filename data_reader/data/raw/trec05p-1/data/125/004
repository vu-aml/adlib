Obviously a great deal has changed over the last few weeks, and I'm not making any irreversible decisions until we have a chance to visit after things settle down.

In the meantime, I'd be happy to help in any way that I can.  Thanks.

If there is any way I can be of help during this busy time -- reading documents, fetching coffee, whatever -- just let me know.
