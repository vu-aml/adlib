Stan:
 
This is first I have learned that EGAS assets are in Rawhide.  We have probably breached both shareholder and debt covenants on all of these assets.  It is obvious that global finance has long been out of control.  How can we run a business when we do not even know who owns the assets.  I will try to understand this better ASAP tomorrow.  Given our current dioscussions on Subic/Batangas it is critical.
