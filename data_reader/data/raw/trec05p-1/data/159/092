Louise,

Carlos has informed me that he has been told he will likely be laid off. 

You may wish to consider intervening to keep him:

- If the new purchaser is interested in the TexMex concept, Carlos is the most important Mexican link. He has great relationships, has negotiated MOU's and is close to contract with multiple customers.

- If we desire to retain EnronOnline expertise, Carlos has it.

- He is still on the US payroll and has an Enron working visa.

Dave
