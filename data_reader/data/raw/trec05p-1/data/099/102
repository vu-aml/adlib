Thank you for joining our walk team for the JDRF Walk to Cure Diabetes.  Sunday is the big day and I wanted to take this opportunity to pass along the walk day information and a few reminders.  Remember that Sunday is the day our time changes - we "fall" back and therefore gain an hour hopefully making it a little easier to arrive for the earlier walk time this year.  

Walk Day Information

·	Walk location - Greenspoint Mall (on I-45 between Beltway 8 and Greens Rd.) 
·	Tent - Look for the tent with the big E banner (Tent 1) very near the starting line.
·	Time - 
o	7:30 	Registration at the Enron tent
Coffee, juice & fruit at the Enron tent
Activities begin on the center stage
o	7:45	National anthem sung by one of our Enron team members, 
Susan Garcia (on Susan Lopez' team), on the center stage
Warm up exercises begin near the stage

·	JDRF T-shirts -

o	Everyone that walks on Sunday will be entitled to a JDRF T-shirt.  Please stop by the registration table at the Enron tent to pick up your ticket that may be redeemed at the JDRF tent for your T-shirt.

Important Reminders

·	Walker Headcount - We need to get an accurate walker headcount to JDRF.   If you have not done so yet, please send me a quick message with the total number of walkers you will have joining you by Noon tomorrow, Thursday, Oct. 29th.
·	T-shirts - If you still need T-shirts for yourself or others that will be joining you for the walk, please send me an email with the number and sizes today or tomorrow morning.
·	Walker forms - It is very important that all signed Walker Check-in Forms are turned in to me at ECS 03747 (please do not mail) or at the Big E Café by no later than 1:00 p.m. on Friday.
o	On the walker brochure, please separate the section that includes the Walker Prize Selection Checklist and the Walker Check-in (Form C).  
o	Please have each walker complete both sections of the form carefully.  
§	Walker Prize Selection Checklist - Each walker should select if they want to have a prize sent to them or not.  If the walker would like a prize, they should select the prize and indicate the size.  If this section is left blank and a prize is not selected it will be assumed that a prize is not anticipated.  
§	Walker Check-in (Form C) - Everyone should fill in the form completely.  The Walk Team should be indicated as ENRON.  The Team Captain is "Phillips".  Please ensure that each person signs their form.
§	Registration Envelope - Please insert the completed check list and Form C along with your donations in the registration envelope and turn in by 1:00 p.m. on Friday.
·	Donations - Although we would prefer to have all donations turned in by 1:00 p.m. on Friday, if you receive donations later I will continue to accept them until November 29th.
·	Cyber Auction - The JDRF Cyber Auction began today and runs through tomorrow.  Please encourage everyone you know to go to the website and participate.
·	Big E Café - Please wear your red Walk T-shirt on Friday and join us for all the activities.  Be sure to encourage your co-workers to attend the Big E Café as well.

Mike and I look forward to seeing you at the walk.  Thank you again for your participation and support.
