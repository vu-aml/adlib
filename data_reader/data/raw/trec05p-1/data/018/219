DEMOCRATS UNVEIL BROAD IMMIGRATION POLICY PRINCIPLES

House and Senate Democratic leaders unveil a broad statement
of principles on immigration policy that incorporates an
"enhanced temporary worker program" and a uniform set of
procedures for immigrants to earn United States citizenship.

At a press briefing, Senate Majority Leader Daschle (D-S.D.)
says President Bush's recent focus on U.S-Mexico relations
"offers us a historic opportunity to recraft our immigration
policies in ways that are fair to America's families."
Daschle says he hopes to introduce legislation in the
current Congress that would embrace the principles, adding
that Democrats intend to work with the Bush administration
to craft such a policy. . . . Page AA-1

HARASSERS CAN BE PREDATORS OR INTERESTED MEN, COURT SAYS

A property management firm maintenance worker who delayed
reporting her supervisor's sexual advances until she could
decide whether he was a "predator" or merely an "interested
man" who could be rebuffed politely, cannot hold her
employer liable for sexual harassment, the Fourth Circuit
decides, because she failed to take advantage of the
employer's sexual harassment policy ("Matvia v. Bald Head
Island Management Inc.,  "4th Cir.,  No. 00-1650,  7/31/01).

Affirming summary judgment to Bald Head Island Management
Inc. on the sexual harassment claim brought by Christina
Matvia under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Judge
Traxler finds that Fourth Circuit case law makes no
distinction between "predators" and "interested men," so
long as their behavior is unwanted and sufficiently severe
or pervasive to alter the terms or conditions of employment.
The court also rejects Matvia's claim that her promotion,
raise, and good performance reviews in light of her "silent
suffering" of the supervisor's advances were tangible job
actions taken against her in violation of Title VII. . . .

SHAW'S CONTRACT WITH UFCW  COVERS 6,500 WORKERS IN NEW
ENGLAND

A newly ratified three-year contract between Shaw's
Supermarkets Inc. and UFCW Local 791 gives approximately
6,500 hourly employees annual wage increases and enhanced
pension benefits and maintains the current health care
coverage with an increase in the employees' premium share.
The contract covers Shaw's employees at 38 retail stores in
Massachusetts and Rhode Island. A separate but parallel
agreement, negotiated at the same time, applies to some 375
workers at the company's distribution center in Wells,
Maine.

The strike-averting settlement also includes a separate
"closing agreement" setting out the terms of the severance
package and enhanced pension benefits for some 380 employees
at a distribution center in East Bridgewater, Mass., which
the company plans to close by the end of October.  Workers
impacted by the closing will get one week's pay for each
year of service with a minimum of four weeks and no maximum.
Employees age 52 or older will be given up to three
additional years of service credit, allowing them to be
eligible for early retirement as if they were age 55. Those
age 58 will receive up to four additional years of credit,
enabling them to retire with the full pension granted to
employees retiring at age 62. . . . Page A-1

AFA TO FILE PETITION BY LABOR DAY FOR DELTA FLIGHT
ATTENDANTS

The Association of Flight Attendants is expecting to file a
petition with the National Mediation Board before Labor Day
to represent some 20,000 flight attendants at Delta
Airlines. That campaign is just one of several organizing
drives discussed during the summer meeting of the AFL-CIO
Executive Council July 31-Aug. 1.

The Delta campaign is taking place at 14 flight attendant
bases around the country. The flight attendants are the last
nonunion flight attendant workforce at any major U.S.
airline, according to the union. The flight attendants began
exploring union representation more than five years ago, and
AFA began its organizing drive at the carrier in earnest in
1998. . . . Page C-1

FIRST CIRCUIT REJECTS CLAIM FOR COGNITIVE PROBLEM DUE TO
CHEMOTHERAPY,

A secretary's cognitive impairment, caused by chemotherapy,
was "mild, reversible, and short lived," the First Circuit
rules, rejecting her discrimination claim under the
Americans with Disabilities Act against her employer
Greenberg, Rosenblatt, Kull & Bitsoli, an accounting firm
("Whitney v. Greenberg, Rosenblatt, Kull & Bitsoli, "1st
Cir., No. 00-2319,  7/27/01). "To prevail, [Ellen] Whitney
would have to establish that her cognitive impairment was
profound enough and of sufficient duration, given the nature
of her impairment, to hamper her ability to work or to
learn," Judge Coffin says. "The record supports neither
restriction."

GRK&B denied Whitney's requests to work part-time or adjust
her hours, gave her a negative job evaluation, and
restricted her duties. The next month, the firm fired her.
Less than three weeks later, she got another job at a bank
where she successfully learned a new computer system, and
then moved on to a permanent job. The court finds that she
did not request accommodations in either position and did
not inform the banks of her disability. "[T]he evidence is
that she satisfactorily completed at the two banks the same
types of administrative duties for which she had been
responsible at GRK&B." . . . Page A-2
