Natural Gas Futures End Flat 




Natural gas futures for November delivery on the NYMEX went nowhere yesterday, failing to break above $2.30 per MMBtu and settling at $2.253 per MMBtu, unchanged from Wednesday. Trading was thin as many traders were out of the ring for a religous holiday. On the positive side, the first month of the winter strip's support held at $2.21 per MMBtu and did not gravitate toward the October futures expiration or physical prices, as volatility has absolutely fled the market. The December contract lost $0.009 to $2.624 per MMBtu, trading within a narrow $0.075 range. So attention remains fixed on the $0.42 differential between the October expiration and the November contract. With $2.21 setting up to be a pivotal support level, a breakdown below $2.20 could be deemed a failure. If the market sees no strength today ahead of a low-demand weekend, expect another sell-off ahead of what happened last Monday when the October contract sold down $0.20 to 30-month lows. Extremely bearish fundamentals remain in place, from weather, to storage, to lack of industrial load and hurricanes. So look for the November contract to trade downward in the next few days in an effort to resolve that high spread. However, trading for today into the weekend remains a tough call as the market has not shown a willingness to go anywhere lately. Next week, the NYMEX extends energy trading from 10 AM to 2 PM EDT, except for Wednesday, which will trade 10 AM to 2:30 PM to accommodate trading after the AGA storage report. The latest NWS forecast for next week calls for below normal weather for the Eastern half of the US, from Texas into the Northeast, and above normal in most of the West. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US was generally flat to $0.05 lower yesterday. Canadian spot prices were up $0.05 $0.10 per MMBtu. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub dipped $0.01 to $1.89 per MMBtu.

Reliant Acquires Orion 




Reliant Resources will buy Orion Power Holdings for about $2.9 billion in cash. The deal will boost Reliants current generating capacity from 14,100 MW to 25,100 MW, either currently in operation or under construction. Orion operates primarily in New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The move will provide Reliant with some strategically placed assets in the transmission-challenged New York City market. Reliant will pay $26.80 per share for Orion, which is about a 40% premium based on its current NYSE price of $19.20 and would assume $1.8 billion of Orion's debt. The purchase will be paid for by cash on hand, $400 million of current credit and a new bridge loan of $1.6 - $1.8 billion. The acquisition would give Reliant a $7.7 billion market capitalization. With deregulation and growing demand for power, it is estimated that at least 180,000 MW of generation capacity will be needed in the US by 2002. The onset of the retail power market resulted in 16% of the nation's generation capacity changing hands, and the other 84% may change ownership over the next 10 years.

Former Trinity CEO Pleads Guilty




Sidney Sers, Trinity Gas former chief executive, has pled guilty to money laundering and obstruction of justice charges and could face life in prison and a $15 million fine. Sers admits to transferring $800,000 made in violation of 1997 and 1998 court orders. The charges stem from a SEC probe of Sers and Trinity. Both were charged with bilking investors out of millions of dollars by issuing a number of false and misleading statements intended to boost the company's shares, allowing officers to sell stock at inflated prices. A sentencing date has not yet been set. Sers transferred Trinity shares to a Cayman Island bank account from a Louisiana account bearing his daughter's name. He admitted laundering those proceeds to Columbia, where he lived as a fugitive in 1998. He also admitted converting $100,000 into cashiers checks.

Exelon Lowers 3rd Quarter Earnings Forecast 




Exelon said 3rd quarter profit will be about 25% below forecasts due to lower demand for electricity. With the downturn in the nations economy, electricity usage by manufacturers has dropped, and with milder temperatures than expected, air conditioning use slumped during the summer. Exelon was formed when Peco Energy merged with Unicom. The company's ComEd and Peco Energy utilities have about 5 million electricity customers in northern Illinois and southeastern Pennsylvania. Peco also sells natural gas to 425,000 customers in the Philadelphia area. Since Exelon has few plants that burn natural gas, it has not been able to take advantage of falling prices. Exelon expects to earn $1.10 to $1.20 per share, lowered from predictions of $1.35 to $1.80 per share. Analysts had forecast a profit of $1.57. Exelon stock fell $5.95 to $44.50, dropping about $1.9 billion from its market value. Its shares have dropped 37% this year.

Williston Basin Plans New Pipeline



Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline plans to file for FERC approval to build 245 miles of 16-inch natural gas pipeline across parts Wyoming, Montana and North Dakota. The pipeline, expected to begin north of Gillette, Wyoming and end south of Killdeer, North Dakota, initially would be capable of transporting from 80 - 120 MMcf per day. Additional transportation capacity could be added incrementally as natural gas production grows. Initially, the pipeline is expected to have 3 large compressor stations - one on the south end of the route in Wyoming, another in eastern Montana and the third in North Dakota. Additional transportation capacity through the pipeline can be made available by adding more compression facilities. The pipeline would transport volumes from developing coal-bed and conventional natural gas production in central Wyoming and south central Montana to interconnecting pipelines that will transport it to large Midwestern markets. The selection of the pipeline's route is nearly complete and initial surveying work has begun. After FERC approval, construction could begin in third quarter of 2002, with transportation service slated to begin in late 2002.

Gulf of Mexico Natural Gas Volumes Declining



The Gulf of Mexico will remain an important source for natural gas, but is unlikely to meet projected soaring demand in the next few years. Since the mid-1980s the focus has shifted increasingly to deeper waters which yield more oil than natural gas. While the shallow water of the continental shelf contain twice as much natural gas as oil, that is reversed in water depths of 1,000 feet or more. The National Petroleum Council forecasts annual demand will rise to 29 Tcf by 2010 from about 23 Tcf now. According to the MMS, natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico has fallen steadily from a peak of 5.14 Tcf in 1997 to 4.9 Tcf in 2000. During that period ,deepwater natural gas production actually rose to 980 Bcf from 380 Bcf, but not enough to offset the larger drop in shallow water production. The MMS forecasts a wide range of possibilities for the future, with total Gulf of Mexico output possibly falling up to 16% by 2005 or rising as high as 24%. In an effort to increase production, the MMS has introduced royalty relief for companies that drill very deep wells in the shallow waters. Although the shallow waters have been thoroughly explored, very few wells have been drilled to 15,000 feet or deeper. The MMS estimates there could be up to 20 Tcf of recoverable reserves of deep wells. The Rocky Mountain region and Canada represent the best opportunities to increase natural gas supplies, possibly sustaining annual demand of 24 Tcf. But much of the estimated 177 Tcf in the Rockies is off-limits to drilling.
