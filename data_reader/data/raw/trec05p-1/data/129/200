NFL Reports Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Erron Kinney <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Kinney is listed as questionable for Sunday's game because of a calf injury. He missed Monday's game because of the injury. 

Frank Wycheck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/14/01
Titans' head coach Jeff Fisher told The Nashville Tennesean that Wycheck's sprained ankle is not a substantial injury. Wycheck suffered the injury Monday, but is expected to play in Sunday's game.

Shad Meier <http://football2! 22! .fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=235120&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Meier is still recovering from thumb surgery and is questionable for Sunday's game. He would have gotten substantial playing time Monday against Baltimore had he played, but won't be needed now that the Titans have two healthy tight ends. 

Amos Zereoue <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Zereoue is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. He has been sidelined for almost a month because of a shoulder injury. 

Damon Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
An MRI on Jones' injured shoulder didn't reveal any structural damage. However, his status for Sunday's game remains uncertain. 

Mike McMahon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
According to published reports, the Lions hope to give McMahon some limited action during upcoming games. He is not expected to play full-time, but this development means that Charlie Batch might lose some playing time, hurting his overall Fantasy value.

Byron Chamberlain <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/! el! ink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1496&>, TE MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
An MRI revealed a small cartilage tear in Chamberlain's right knee, but he is not expected to require surgery. All signs point to him playing Monday against the Giants, so feel free to use him this week.

Freddie Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1843&>, TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 11/14/01
The San Diego Union-Tribune says Jones (ankle) has been advised against playing this week. Results of an MRI exam are not available yet, but Steve Heiden is expected to start in his place.

Tim Dwight <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=12340&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Dwight (lung) is doubtful for Sunday's game. He has not been very healthy when productive, so don't count on him for much production from him during the rest of the season.

Troy Hambrick <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=194768&>, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Hambrick is dealing with a rotator cuff injury, but he's expected to practice later in the week. He'll likely start his third consecutive game this weekend if Emmitt Smith's knee isn't 100 percent by Friday. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/el! in! k?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/14/01
Smith (knee) is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Philadelphia. If he is unable to go, Troy Hambrick would likely start his third straight game, barring any further damage to his injured shoulder. 

Chris Weinke <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/14/01
Weinke (shoulder) was only able to throw on the sidelines Tuesday, but was expected to practice on Wednesday. If he is unable to play, Matt Lytle would likely make his second consecutive start. 

Peyton Manning <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=12531&>, QB IND - Neal/McKay Updated 11/14/01
The Indianapolis Star says Manning had a splint inserted to stabilize the teeth in his lower jaw. He is expected to start on Sunday.

Drew Bledsoe <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1041&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Bledsoe has been cleared to play, but Tom Brady will start against the Rams. Bledsoe said he will try and prove he is ready to play by performing well in practice, but it doesn't appear likely he will get a chance to start. But the future past Week 10 appears to be unclear, and there is no guarantee Brady will hold o! nt! o the job past the Rams game.

O.J. McDuffie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1246&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
McDuffie is ready to return to practice from the PUP list. He will be eligible for activation on Dec. 4, but he may still miss the rest of the season.

Aaron Brooks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=133233&>, QB NO - Matty Updated 11/14/01
According to published reports, many veterans on the New Orleans roster have expressed their displeasure with Brooks' inconsistency this season. The reports also stated that those same veterans would rather see Jeff Blake under center, but that doesn't seem likely to happen. The coaching staff feels as though Brooks has the talent to be a top-notch NFL quarterback, so don't expect a change under center any time soon. 

Cowboys <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=8&>, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Linebacker Dexter Coakley is expected to miss two weeks of action due to a sprained knee. He suffered the injury during last weekend's loss to Atlanta. Dallas' defense has played well, but they're an inconsistent unit from a Fantasy perspective. 

Jon Hilbert <http://football222.fan! ta! sy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=195687&>, K NO - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Hilbert has been signed by the Dallas Cowboys, and will serve as their starting kicker in Tim Seder's absence. Hilbert's value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point, however, so don't bother picking him up outside of deeper leagues. 

Tim Seder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=196725&>, K DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Seder is expected to miss several weeks of action after injuring his ankle last Sunday against Atlanta. The team has signed former New Orleans booter Jon Hilbert to take over the kicking duties in Dallas. 

Rob Moore <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 11/14/01
Moore, who had hamstring surgery two weeks ago, will begin some light running on Wednesday. His status for the rest of the season is still unclear, however, so don't bother picking him up off the waiver wire. 

Terry Hardy <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=12423&>, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Hardy (shoulder) is expected to miss a few more weeks of action. Unless you play in a very deep league, holding onto him isn't advisable at this point. 

Terry Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=b! ig! e01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/14/01
Allen will be sidelined four to six weeks because of a fractured left hand. He suffered the injury in Monday's game. Jason Brookins will start in his absence.

Steve McNair <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
McNair will wear a cast on his throwing hand for at least a day after aggravating an injury during Monday night's 16-10 loss to Baltimore. He had X-rays and other tests on his right hand Tuesday, and coach Jeff Fisher said the results were negative. But doctors found an apparent hairline break in McNair's thumb, which he originally hurt last season in practice. He is questionable for Sunday's game. "We put him in a cast until tomorrow [Wednesday]. We'll see how he is with some soft tosses going with the hand," Fisher said. 

Ricky Watters <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
According to the Seattle Times, Watters is expected to return from his shoulder injury in two weeks. However, he is not guaranteed to reclaim the starting running back job wi! th! Shaun Alexander performing so well. We recommend you hold onto both players until it becomes clear which one will get the starts over the second half of the season, although we're betting it will be Alexander.

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/13/01
Smith predicted Monday that he will be able to return from a sprained right ankle in time for Sunday's game against Washington. If he can't go, Keith Poole would become Denver's top receiving option, with Chris Cole, Scottie Montgomery and Kevin Kasper also filling in. However, Poole is already expected to replace Eddie Kennison as the team's second wideout.

! Ed! die Kennison  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1296&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Kennison returned to the Broncos Monday and informed them that he is "unretiring," according to the Denver Post. While this is a radical turnaround from his message of retirement over the weekend, he might not be welcomed back by the team as a result of his change of decision. It is unclear whether Kennison will be placed on the reserve/suspended list or reinstated to the roster, but either way it's highly unlikely he will be able to help any Fantasy teams the remainder of the season. Drop him.

Cameron Cleeland <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=12277&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
According to published reports, Cleeland won't be available for Sunday's game against Indianap! ol! is. His high ankle sprain still hasn't healed sufficently, so look for Boo Williams and Lamont Hall to get the majority of the playing time in his absence. 

Santana Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Moss is expected to make his season debut Sunday against Miami. He has been sidelined all season with a knee injury but is listed as probable for Sunday's game.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/13/01
Chrebet is expected to play Sunday, despite suffering from a shoulder injury. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 Fantasy re! ce! iver. 

Fred Taylor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/13/01
Taylor is expected to play Sunday against Pittsburgh. He has been sidelined for over a month because of a groin injury.

Teams Player News 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Frank Player News

Terance Mathis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1189&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/12/01
Mathis suffered a dislocated finger on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Bill Schroeder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1593&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/12/01
Schroeder may have re-aggravated his ankle injury during a TD celebration on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Garrison Hearst <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1164&>, Active RB Updated 11/11/01
Hearst had solid game against New Orleans, compiling 160 scrimmage yards on Sunday. He seems to have established himself as San Francisco's featured back in recent weeks, which is keeping Kevan Barlow's Fantasy value at a minimum. 

Olandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=133291&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/11/01
Gary has been declared inactive for Sunday's game against San Diego. This is the second week in a row that Gary will not suit up for a game. 

Corey Dillon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1681&>, Active RB Updated 11/11/01
The Jaguars held Dillon to 58 rushing yards, but he did score on a seven-yard TD run. Even if opponents limit Dillon's yardage numbers at times, it is difficult to stifle him completely. He remains worthy of No. 1 RB status on many Fantasy teams.

Maurice Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=188183&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/11/01
Smith had a big day rushing against Dallas on Sunday, posting 148 yards in Atlanta's 20-13 win. Considering the number of running backs that have sustained injuries this season, Smith is becoming the type of back Fantasy owners should consider starting every week. 

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1028&>, Active QB Updated 11/09/01
Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face a Chicago team on Sunday that is a bit vulnerable to the pass, so be sure to start Favre this week. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1294&>, Active WR Updated 11/09/01
Bruce had a huge game before St. Louis' bye week, and he'll likely have another big performance in Week Nine. Look for Bruce to put up 100 yards receiving and a score against the questionable Carolina secondary. 

Jake Plummer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1003&>, Reserve QB Updated 11/08/01
Plummer continues to be a mediocre Fantasy quarterback, but you may actually want to consider starting him this week against the Giants. He threw for 318 yards and two TDs in his last game against the G-Men, and has five TDs in his last three games against New York overall. 

Titans <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=29&>, Active DT Updated 11/06/01
Linebacker Randall Godfrey suffered torn cartilage in his left knee during Sunday's win over Jacksonville. He'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and will be listed as questionable for Monday's game against Baltimore. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1236&>, Active WR Updated 11/04/01
Smith had a huge game against Tennessee, catching seven passes for 120 yards. He is one of the top receivers in Fantasy Football and worth starting on a weekly basis. 

James Thrash <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1859&>, Active WR Updated 11/04/01
Thrash caught four passes for 80 yards and two TDs at Arizona. Don't expect good numbers from Thrash every week, because he tends to disappear against more established defenses. He faces a Minnesota defense with a shaky secondary this week, however, so he may be worth the gamble. 

Dorsey Levens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1107&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

David Akers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1666&>, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.
