Hey You!!!
 
I don't usually do the e-mail thing but I am tonight....
 
Listen I felt a little strange talking with you the other
day....you seemed a bit stoic or maybe a bit too business
like.....Is everything ok with you??  I realize you are very 
busy right now after coming back from a lot of time off....
But it did feel strange......
 
I just want you to know that I did not call to get together
with you I just called to see how you where doing....I seems
to me that you felt obligated to tell me that we would get
together sometime.....Don't do that.....Really I just need 
a friend sometimes to chat with....I realize I can be quite 
hard to get along with and not real appealing at those times..
 
So I guess my bottom line is that I think you are a great person
inside and you are a blast to be with.....It would be great to
get together with you just to have some fun....but please
don't feel obligated ..........
 
Anyway, I am not sure if I got my point across or not but
it would be nice to hear from you...
 
Always........
 
Robyn


See Ya
Have a Great Day!!!!
