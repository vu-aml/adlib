Here is some information on the paths in question.

Robert's Info:
Contract 106252 lowered their Intraday 2 volume to 5,922 mmbtu.(EPSQ)
The EPSQ on Transwestern is 5,921.
The actual EPSQ volume is 5921.5.  TW rounded the volume sown and NNG rounded the volume up.
Contract 106525 was manually scheduled down by 1 mmbtu for the Final 8:00 AM Cycle

TMS actions
(1)   When you inspect the contract 106252 (NNG), you notice that the EPSQ is 5922 on both receipt and delivery because their is no fuel.
(2)   When you inspect the contract 27606 (TW), the EPSQ is 6000 for receipt and 5922 for delivery.  That is calculating each side seperately.
(3)   When the volume was entered for 27606, I assumed they entered the receipt side volume of 6000 (EPSQ caclualted from above).  The fuel is then calculated from that 	and the delivery side is populated.  The fuel rate is .0131 which calculates the fuel volume of 78.6 (rounded up to 79) which in turn calculates the delivery volume to be 	5921.

I have started the process to find out why TW and NNG's EPSQ rounds differently.

	John and Terry, could we look into TW and NNG rounding in the same direction for EPSQ?
	It seems like that would be more effective.  Thanks. Lynn
