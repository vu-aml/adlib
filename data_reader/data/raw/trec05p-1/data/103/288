NLRB RULES 2-1 IMMIGRATION STATUS WAS 'SMOKESCREEN' TO FIRE
WORKERS

A California waste recycling facility used its employees'
immigration status as a "smokescreen" to illegally fire 11
union supporters following an election win by the
International Union of Operating Engineers, the National
Labor Relations Board rules in a 2-1 decision ("Nortech
Waste, "336 N.L.R.B. No. 79, 9/28/01 [released 10/24/01]).
Members Truesdale and Walsh agree with an administrative law
judge that Nortech Waste committed unfair labor practices by
contacting the Immigration and Naturalization Service a few
days after the election and telling 11 employees they could
not work until they straightened out their paperwork. The
company "significantly departed from its ordinary course of
business," belying its contention that it was merely trying
to comply with the Immigration Reform and Control Act, the
board finds.

Dissenting, Chairman Hurtgen maintains Nortech did not fire
the 11 workers on Oct. 1, 1997. The company informed the
employees that it had contacted INS, that the workers had
three days to straighten out their paperwork, and that they
could not work in the meantime, Hurtgen finds. "The clear
implication was that, absent a satisfactory resolution with
INS, they "would be" discharged," the chairman says. . . .

REFUSAL TO RECOGNIZE AFFILIATION BASED ON PETITION WAS ULP,
NLRB FINDS

A car parts manufacturer in Tawas City, Mich., violated
federal labor law when it refused to recognize its
employees' union as an affiliate of the United Auto Workers
after employees presented a petition signed by more than
two-thirds of the bargaining unit stating that they did not
want to be affiliated with the UAW, the National Labor
Relations Board rules in a 2-1 decision ("Tawas Ind. Inc.,
"336 N.L.R.B. No. 24,   9/28/01 [released 10/22/01]).

The Tawas Industries employees should have gone through
union channels to disaffiliate their union, Tawas
Independent Workers Association, from UAW, say Members
Leibman and Walsh. A "disaffiliation is a change in the
legal and institutional relationships between two unions. It
cannot be carried out externally to the unions," they find,
reversing a decision by an NLRB administrative law judge.
Dissenting, Chairman Hurtgen argues that the company did not
commit an unfair labor practice by refusing to recognize the
affiliation and accuses the majority of elevating "form over
substance.". . . Page A-2

COMPENSATION COSTS RISE 4.0 PERCENT FOR PRIVATE EMPLOYERS

Even as wage pressures moderated, higher benefit costs
helped to boost private industry employers' total
compensation costs by 4.0 percent over the year ended in
September, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics.

The latest figures from the employment cost index show that
private industry wages climbed 3.6 percent over the 12
months ended in September, down from 3.8 percent in the year
ended in June. Benefit costs of private employers climbed
4.9 percent during the 12 months ended in September, about
the same as in the 12 months ended in June, and down
somewhat from the 6.0 percent jump over the year ended in
September 2000. . . . Page D-1

MINNESOTA HIGH SCHOOL ACCOMMODATED NEEDS OF MUSLIM HALL
MONITOR

Although cautioning about a need for religious sensitivity
in the workplace, a federal judge dismisses the claims of a
Somali Muslim who contended that the Rochester, Minn.,
public schools failed to accommodate his religious needs in
violation of federal and state civil rights laws ("Sheikh v.
Independent School District 535, "D. Minn., No. 00-1896,
10/18/01).

Judge Frank finds the school district responded quickly to
Mustaf Sheikh's request to wear his religious head gear, use
break time for prayer, and combine his breaks for Friday
attendance at a local mosque. Sheikh's allegations of
ostracism by his co-workers, although creating "an
unpleasant working environment," did not rise to the level
of actionable harassment, the court holds in dismissing the
discrimination claims under Title VII of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act and Minnesota law. . . . Page A-2

IMPAIRED LIVER FUNCTION NOT MAJOR LIFE ACTIVITY, SEVENTH
CIRCUIT SAYS

A technical director's liver function, which was impaired by
hepatitis B, was not a "major life activity" under the
Americans with Disabilities Act, the Seventh Circuit rules
(" Furnish v. SVI Sys. Inc., " 7th Cir.,  No. 99-2431,
10/22/01). The court affirms summary judgment for SVI
Systems Inc. in a suit brought by Kent Furnish.

"The activities that have been held to be major life
activities under the ADA (e.g., eating, working,
reproducing) are not the impairments' characteristics--they
are activities that have been impacted because of the
plaintiffs' impairments," Judge Kanne writes for the court.
"Therefore, we reject the notion that 'liver function' is a
major life activity under the ADA." . . . Page A-4
