   Word of the Day for Wednesday March 6, 2002:

   frisson \free-SOHN\, noun:
   A  moment  of  intense  excitement;  a  shudder;  an emotional
   thrill.

     When  we  think  a  story  hasn't been invented, there's an
     extra frisson in reading it.
     --"Too true," [1]Independent, April 12, 1998

     As   every   parent   knows,   children  have  a  love-hate
     relationship  with  stories  about  monsters. They love the
     frisson  of  hearing about such terrifying creatures as the
     Cyclops  --  but  hate to think about what they might do if
     they bumped into one.
     --"Strange   but  true:  One  in  the  eye  for  all  those
     Homer-phobes," [2]Daily Telegraph, June 21, 1998

     When  we  stopped  in traffic at the Plaza de la Cibeles on
     the  Paseo del Prado, where a grandiose 18th-century statue
     of  the  goddess of fertility poised on a chariot seemed to
     be  waiting  for  the  light to change, a little frisson of
     pleasure  jolted  through  me,  because this part of Madrid
     reminded me of Paris.
     --"Counting  Pesetas  in  Madrid," [3]New York Times, March
     17, 1996
     _________________________________________________________

   Frisson  comes  from  the  French,  from Old French friçon, "a
   trembling," ultimately from Latin frigere, "to be cold."
