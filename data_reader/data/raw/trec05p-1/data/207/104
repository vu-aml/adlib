I spoke with Eric today regarding the recommendation.  As he will likely inform you in an email, the only current recommendation needed would be solicited by email of phone from AT&T.  I will put together some comments on the work Eric did for your reference in responding to the email/call.  Eric may need a general letter later, however, in the future.

Martin,

Can you prepare a draft of recommendation for  Eric?
I can elaborate more and sign it.

Vince,

My phone is (650) 725-0541 (office).

I am still in a state of shock about Enron and I am still absorbing all the
news I can.  It is almost unbelievable to me that the company I worked for
this summer is now essentially kaput.

From the website I contacted you from, I take it that you are no longer with
Enron.  Please accept my deepest sympathies and best wishes in what must
surely be a difficult time.  I hope you were not as heavily invested in Enron
as many employees seemed to be.

I wanted to contact you regarding letters of recommendation.  I'm currently
looking for summer employment, in particular at network providers (such as
AT&T and IBM) as well as some financial institutions.  Would it be any
trouble for you to write a note on my behalf?  They may be requested via
email, so an actual letter may not be necessary.  I would have more details
later.

My best to you and your family and all those I knew this summer ---

Eric
