In this week's update, we present a very information whitepaper by Greg
Keers, Chairman of KWI, which explains how VAR (value-at-risk) and PAR
(profit-at-risk) are risk measures which should be used together in order to
protect your enterprise and maximise trading profits.  You can learn more
about how risk can affect your trading operations at our Energy, Emissions
and Weather Trading conferences in Amsterdam in just a few weeks' time.  We
have also confirmed that Day 3 of the Emissions Trading event will include a
workshop with exclusive interactive sessions to be led by Baker & McKenzie,
CO2SIM & Strategy Analytics.  Substantial discounts are available for our
subscribers who do not want to miss out on this unique event - see below for
further details.

Our final announcement this week is our second emission trading event, the
Eyeforenergy CO2 Trading USA conference, which will take place in Chicago in
June.  Judging by the interest which has already been generated by the
European variant, this event promises to be a key forum for everyone who is
or will be trading CO2 and GHGs, in order to alleviate risk and, in some
cases, generate untapped profit.  Be sure to take a closer look, especially
if you are interested in getting involved...

WHITE PAPER: Taking the Corporate Risk out of Power Trading
             by Greg Keers, Chairman, KWI

Trading in power is not for the faint hearted. Supply and demand change by
the hour, which can cause extreme volatility in prices at the moment power
companies are committed to delivering to their customers. Any kind of
shortage at this point and prices will spike to the value of the lost load,
which may be many times more than the cost of supply. In the United States,
summer price spikes from $20 per MWh to $2,000 per MWh are not uncommon...
