WISCONSIN APPEALS COURT REFUSES TO ENFORCE NO-HIRE AGREEMENT

A Wisconsin supplier of physical therapists cannot enforce a
no-hire agreement with a group of nursing homes, which was
entered into without the therapists' knowledge or consent,
the Wisconsin Court of Appeals decides, addressing an issue
of first impression ("Heyde Cos., d/b/a Greenbriar
Rehabilitation v. Dove Healthcare LLC, "Wis. Ct. App., No.
01-0863, 10/23/01). Under agreements between supplier
Greenbriar Rehabilitation and 34 nursing homes, including
Dove Healthcare, Greenbriar provided physical therapists.
The nursing homes were prohibited from hiring Greenbriar
therapists without the supplier's consent. If Greenbriar
consented, the nursing home had to pay the supplier a steep
fee. Dove hired Greenbriar therapists without seeking the
supplier's consent or paying the fee.

Overturning a $64,314 judgment for Greenbriar, the appeals
court decides the no-hire provision is unenforceable because
it violates Wisconsin public policy favoring unrestrained
competition in the employment market. "We conclude that an
employee's individual right and freedom to contract may not
be restricted by a contract between two employers unless the
employee is aware of and consents to the contract," Judge
Peterson says. . . . Page AA-1

NINTH CIRCUIT UPHOLDS $1 MILLION DAMAGES AWARD IN RACE BIAS
CASE

A company's failure to respond to co-workers' harassment of
its only African American employee was negligence and
evidence of remedial efforts would not have altered the
significant finding against the employer, the Ninth Circuit
holds ("Swinton v. Potomac Corp. d/b/a Crescent Cardboard
Co. d/b/a Crescent/U.S. Mat, "9th Cir., No. 99-36147,
10/24/01).

Ruling on an appeal by manufacturer U.S. Mat, which was
found liable for racial harassment in a claim by Troy
Swinton, the Ninth Circuit upholds a $1 million punitive
damages award. In doing so, the court refuses to create a
bright-line rule requiring trial courts to admit evidence of
remedial efforts undertaken after the filing of a
discrimination complaint. The court also rules that the
affirmative defense to employer liability established by the
U.S. Supreme Court in "Faragher v. Boca Raton " and
"Burlington Industries Inc. v. Ellerth " is not available to
employers when the harasser is not the plaintiff's
supervisor and the plaintiff is alleging negligence. . . .

UNION SECRETARY'S WRONGFUL DISCHARGE CLAIM PREEMPTED BY
LMRDA

A local union secretary in Southern California who was fired
for her support of Proposition 226--a 1998 anti-labor voter
initiative that the union had fought--is barred from
bringing a wrongful discharge action against the United Food
and Commercial Workers union, a state appeals court holds
("Thunderburk v. UFCW Local 324, "Cal. Ct. App., No.
E029765, 10/22/01).

Plaintiff Nattie Thunderburk had access to a wide range of
confidential union information, which if disclosed "could
have thwarted union policies and objectives, " according to
the California Court of Appeal for the Fourth Appellate
District. "[D]espite limitations normally imposed on
employers by California's wrongful termination law," UFCW
Local 324, therefore had an "unfettered right to terminate
confidential employees" like Thunderburk under the
Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. . . .

COURT OKS $350,000 AWARD FOR WORKER PHOTOGRAPHED IN REST
ROOM

The California appeals court upholds a $350,000 verdict for
an auto body repair shop production manager who sued his
employer after co-workers broke into the office rest room,
took a photograph of him while he was urinating, and showed
the photo to other employees who then subjected him to
ribald and humiliating comments ("Fotiades v. Hi-Tech Auto
Collision & Painting Servs. Inc.,  "Cal. Ct. App.,  No.
E029854,  "unpublished" 10/17/01).

The trial court properly reduced the jury's original $1
million compensatory damages award to $350,000 on Chris
Fotiades's invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of
emotional distress claims against Hi-Tech Auto Collision &
Painting Services Inc., Justice Richli rules in the
unpublished opinion.  But the appeals court strikes down the
trial court's $150,000 punitive damages award, finding
insufficient evidence that a director, officer, or managing
agent of Hi-Tech either participated in, authorized, or
ratified the employees' outrageous conduct. . . . Page A-9

UNILATERAL WORK-POLICY CHANGES FOLLOWING UNION ELECTION
VIOLATED NLRA

The National Labor Relations Board's determination that
numerous unfair labor practices took place at Pepsi Cola
Bottling Co.'s Fayetteville, N.C., plant following a
successful 1991 union representation election is endorsed by
the Fourth Circuit ("NLRB v. Pepsi Cola Bottling Co. of
Fayetteville Inc., "4th Cir., No. 00-1969, 10/12/01). In the
latest development in a longstanding labor dispute, the
Fourth Circuit agrees to enforce an NLRB bargaining order
based on the board's showing that Pepsi violated the
National Labor Relations Act by unilaterally changing
various employment policies following the election.

The court rejects Pepsi's contention that the United Food
and Commercial Workers waived its right to bargain over the
unilateral policy changes, which included new compensation
procedures, altered work schedules, and stricter
disciplinary procedures. Given a UFCW representative's
testimony that she received notice of the proposed changes
after they were announced to employees, the court concludes
the union did not waive its right to bargain over the
changes by failing to request bargaining. It also finds that
the changes amounted to "material alterations of the terms
and conditions of employment" and that Pepsi violated the
NLRA by unilaterally imposing them. . . . Page A-3
