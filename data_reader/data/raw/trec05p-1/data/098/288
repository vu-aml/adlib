What are you doing?  Have you taken  a lunch.  I already ate, but I need to
take a break.  Maybe we could rendezvous?  Let me know.

He Mat,

I just realized that I can't call your cell number from my work phone.
I
don't know if you are going to get this, but my work number is 503
219-8757.
Or, I will try and call you at home so pick up the phone at my house.

Laurel
