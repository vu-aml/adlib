Subject: an object lesson

Dunno about you. I've run into a couple of people in the last week or so 
who believe that peace is, even at this point, our only viable option.

Sometimes, an object lesson is appropriate...

1) Approach the person who is talking about "peace" and saying there should
be, "no retaliation."

2) Engage in brief conversation, ask if military force is appropriate.

3) When he says "No," ask, "Why not?"

4) Wait until he says something to the effect of,
"Because that would just cause more innocent deaths, which would be
awful and we should not cause more violence."

5) When he's in mid-sentence, punch him in the face as hard as you can.

6) When he gets back up to up to punch you, point out that it would be a
mistake and contrary to his values to strike you, because that would, "be
awful and he should not cause more violence."

7) Wait until he agrees that he has pledged not to commit additional
violence.

8) Punch him in the face again, harder this time.

Repeat steps 5 through 8 until they understand that sometimes it is
necessary to punch back.
