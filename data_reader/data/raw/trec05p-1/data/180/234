James,

As soon as we have a revised PPA invoice for October that we feel will be the final info, could you fax a copy to me.  The customer is waiting for some other data from me that uses SMS and DDVC amounts for the past year, and I cannot finish the info for him until we have this resolved.  I'd like to call him and give him an update.  Do you know approximately when we might have the revised PPA?

Thanks,

Joni
