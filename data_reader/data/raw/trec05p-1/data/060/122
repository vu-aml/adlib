Is it time to take control of this situation and make a few calls to Patagonia?

I am still with Enron in Costa Mesa.

We just hit Patagonia with $70,000 back invoice for invoicing errors.  I am up for calling them but the workload from other customers is such that they are not getting much attention.

I spoke with Patagonia this morning.  They are interested in rolling the
renewable purchases out to all US stores (12 new facilities) and possibly
blending and extending the commodity portion of their purchases in
California across as many stores as possible.

Here are my notes on what we talked about on the latest telephone call.

There was no definitive talk about deal structures but that will be coming
up shortly.  Patagonia is looking for savings and renewable energy.  I
introduced risk management instead of savings and it was well received but
will require more clarification as we move forward.

I spoke with the Director of Retail and will be speaking with the VP of
environmental programs to gather more information on the structures that
they would like to see.

I spoke with the Account Manager/Service Manager for Fetzer Vineyards and
she said that they are interested in new renewable products as well.  She
asked to listen in on our call on 6/18/01.  She is in San Ramon and her name
is Renee Fernandez.  I have met the customer and would like to move ahead
with a meeting to get this customer on board as well.

Contact me if you have any questions.
