	The following is a recap of the status of the implementation of the PGAS calculation for
	31 day charts and 31 day index cards.

	Beginning with March production (April Billing), GMS will have the new calculation
	in PGAS for 31 day charts and 31 day index cards.  This calculation is to give NNG
	more representation of daily estimated volume for billing purposes.  As a reminder
	the 31 day charts and 31 day index cards will NOT be processed using the
	delineator.  The calculation is considered to be representative of the daily volume
	and no PPA's will be processed on the calculated estimates.

	At this time there will NOT be a daily PGAS calculation on 7 day and 16 day charts.
	These charts will by (1) tracked for timely receipt; and (2) integrated for daily volumes
	when received.

	Any charts received after the required deadline will be processed as a PPA.

	If anyone has any questions, please let Gary Anderson or I know.  Thanks. Lynn
