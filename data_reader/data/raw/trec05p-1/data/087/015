Mark suggested that I document the major steps remaining in the Plan process.  It appears that most of the numbers are nearing final approval and Mark suggested that I document the major steps remaining in the plan process:

1. Finalize EGM and EA (Storey) Development project approvals.
[Kerry Roper]  EA projects Finalized. EGM & EIM are still changing today.  The changes of the last few days has also had an impact to other business units, especially EES as the development managers have changed some participation percentages.
2. Show EA IT Development projects for Energy Ops as flowing through Energy Ops' allocation to EA (Note: I am assuming this is only for EA).
[Kerry Roper]  Done
3. Finalize Headcount numbers based on IT Development changes.
[Kerry Roper]  Changes still being made.  Used estimated headcount for Development in the allocation process.
4. Get "buy-off" on other business unit headcount numbers used in allocation process (9:30 meeting on Wed.)
[Kerry Roper]  Done
5. Run infrastructure charge-back model using updated headcount numbers.
[Kerry Roper]  Done
6. Based on results of charge-back model, change depreciation, bonus and indirect allocations.
[Kerry Roper]  Done
7. Receive new EA allocations (which will be higher due to adding indirects.)
[Kerry Roper]  Not received yet.
8. Add new Corporate and EA allocations received to internal allocation process. (New Corp alloc. received 10/16).
[Kerry Roper]  Done using estimates for new charges from EA. These should be accurate based on infrastructure dollars sent to them.
9. Rerun internal allocations (indirects).
[Kerry Roper]  Done
10. Recalculate Enterprise Portal allocations to business units.
[Kerry Roper]  This task not needed.
11. Note: B. Richter indicated that the new allocation procedure might not be completed this week. I am assuming that we will keep the existing  budget allocation for the budget. (Will this work for EBS and ETS?).  I also assume we are final with other changes to Energy Ops and infrastructure.
12. Get approval for split of EES Retail and EES Wholesale.
13. Once all numbers are final, verify that all ENW team budget templates are updated and then saved to the intercompany billing file.
14. Re-create billing matrix and invoice file (6-8 hour process including review).
15. Produce income summary income statement by ENW team. (Use as check).
16. Resubmit all Corporate templates and reports (6-8 hour process).
17. Produce reports for Office of the Chair and prepare for Ken Lay presentation. 

These are the major steps in "my world."  I'm sure I am leaving some items out, but I think it gives you a feel for the steps we need to take.  Timing largely hinges on getting the final numbers completed and approved.
