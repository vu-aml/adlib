Gentlemen,
In preparation to comply with the Operator Qualification Rule, we need to schedule a training session for your OQ evaluators.  I know that you have reviewed the SBP Verifier Training CBT module, but we think that a better approach for non-SBP personnel would be a live trainer who can present the responsibilities of the evaluator from the perspective of the OQ rule.  The instructor we have in mind has a very good understanding of both the regulatory requirements of OQ and the process of skills evaluation.

I expect this training session to take no more than a day.  Please let me know a couple of dates when this class could be presented to the personnel of your choice.  Once we know how many people and when to schedule classes, we'll contact the instructor.  (Trainer is not available the last week of February and the first week of March)   Please reply within the next week so that we can reserve time on the instructor's schedule.

Call if you have questions or concerns.  (713-345-6857)
