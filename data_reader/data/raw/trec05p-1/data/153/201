Jason C. Bass was unable to find a Wish List for you at Amazon.com and asked us to send you e-mail, requesting that you create one. 

Now--we don't presume to tell you what to do. But if someone wanted to
buy stuff for us and asked that we create a Wish List...well, let's just say we know what we'd do. Here's Jason C. Bass's personal plea to you: 

Hello,
I was looking for your Wish List at Amazon.com,
but I couldn't find it. I want to buy you
something and I want to make sure it's
something you really want. Create a Wish List
at Amazon.com so I know what to get you.
Thanks!

How could you resist? To set up a Wish List, visit www.amazon.com/new-wishlist

Many thanks. And happy wishing!

Your friends at Amazon.com
