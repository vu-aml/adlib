Don,
 
I have been working with Jeanie Slone on trying to resolve the holiday and overtime payment issues that we have been having with regard to your staff not being properly paid for their overtime and holiday work from Thanksgiving forward.  Unfortunately, I was just told that we can no longer pay any "incentive pay" to previous or current employees as per our bankruptcy lawyers, and at there may be problems because they are "exempt" employees who are typically not paid overtime.  However, I assure you that we are working to try and resolve this matter as soon as possible, and I will follow-up with you as soon as I have further clarification from the attorney's.
 
If you have any other questions, please call me on Amy Fitzpatrick's number (I am sitting at her desk today) at X52729.
 
Thanks,
 
Anne Labbe'
HR Analyst
