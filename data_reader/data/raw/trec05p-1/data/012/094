Yes.  Azurix caused us a big headache, because the contract they did in 2000 was weak, but Mike stuck it out, did what we asked him to do to get it done in the end.

Professional
Integrity
Relationship-Oriented
Understands big deal processes - legal, relationship, negotiations, politics, etc.

Yes.  Mike was the senior Azurix guy on the deal.  He was on the conf calls a lot.  He spent a lot of time in CA throughout that deal.
