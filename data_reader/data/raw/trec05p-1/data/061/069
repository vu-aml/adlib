The contract was awarded to a foreign contractor to
the tune of US$78,000,000.00 (Sixty Million United
States Dollars). But in the course of me negotiation with
them , there was a short fall
US$28,000,000.00 (Twenty-Eight million United States
Dollars)

contractor. This contract has been satisfactorily
executed and inspected as the Contractor is
presently securing payment from my Ministry, where I
am the Executive Director in-charge of all foreign
contract payment approval.

As a civil servant still in active government service,
I am forbidden by law to operate an account outside
the shores of Nigeria. Hence this message to you
seeking your assistance so as to enable me present
your private/company account details as a beneficiary
of contractual claims alongside that of the 
contractor, to enable me transfer the difference of
US$28,000,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million United States
Dollars) into your provided account. On actualization,
the fund will be disbursed as stated below.

1. 30% of the fund will be for you as beneficiary

2. 10% for reimbursement to both parties for
incidental expenses that may be incurred during the
course of the transaction.

3. 60% of the fund will be for me which I intend to
invest in your country with you as my partner.

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked
out for a smooth actualization of the transaction
within the next few working days of commencement. For
further details as to the workability of this
transaction, please respond by return mail on my
