Cara,

Email Corry Bentley with the list of counterparties you would changed. If he is o.k. with those changes, then you may forward those changes to me and I will put in a GCP Request to have each one changed in the system.

Just let me know.

Regards,

Kimberly

Hi Kim

Thanks for getting SCEM changed to MIRANT.  They started showing up right this morning.

How difficult is it to get them changed, and who all is affected by it?  I have a laundry list of codes that are cumbersome or confusing, and would like to see about changing a batch of them.  I will do all the leg work of finding out if certain ones are ok with everyone, but wanted your input and advice.

Thanks,

Cara
