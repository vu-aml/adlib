Dear eric,




ROCKETS LOOK TO MOVE BACK OVER .500

The Rockets return to Compaq Center tonight for the first time since dismantling the Dallas Mavericks on Nov. 17 to host hot-shooting Peja Stojakovic and the Sacramento Kings. 

Houston will have revenge on its mind against the Kings, who defeated the Rockets 113-77 on Nov. 19. Steve Francis will miss tonight's game to rest a sore foot which caused him to miss Friday's game in Seattle and leave early during Sunday's contest against the Clippers. But Moochie Norris is ready to step in and help the Rockets avenge last week's loss. 

Be sure to log on to rockets.com(http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=137036&UID=45456540&MID=190523)later this afternoon to check out our Game Preview section, including video interviews from Rockets players and Head Coach Rudy T. about tonight's game.
