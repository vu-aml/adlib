MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS AS NAM, OSHA SETTLE LAWSUIT OVER RULE
The NAM and the Labor Dept. (DOL) on 11/16 settled the NAM's lawsuit
challenging OSHA's recordkeeping rule.  It takes effect 1/1/02.  The
agreement requires DOL to inform its enforcement officers nationwide of the
meaning of several critical provisions.  OSHA will not issue citations for
rule violations during the first 120 days, provided the employer attempts in
good faith to meet its obligations and agrees to make corrections.  To view

PRESIDENT SIGNS STOPGAP BILL TO CONTINUE FUNDING THROUGH 12/7
President Bush 11/17 signed into law the fifth spending resolution of FY
2002 to keep unfunded government departments and agencies operating through
12/7.  Five of the 13 annual spending bills have been signed into law.
Congress has sent three others to the President for his signature. But five
are unfinished.


TERRORISM INSURANCE BILL MAY REACH WHITE HOUSE BY DECEMBER 
Terrorism insurance bill H.R. 3210 will pass the House next week, be
reconciled with the Senate and be signed by President Bush in December, said
House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-TX).  The Ways and Means Committee on
11/16 amended the bill to eliminate provisions that would permit the
insurance industry to accumulate tax-free reserves as a bulwark against
losses resulting from possible future terrorist actions.  The NAM is urging
Congress to finalize action soon on a bill to stabilize the insurance
market.


TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY VOTE EXPECTED DECEMBER 6
A House vote is expected 12/6 on NAM-backed bipartisan TPA bill H.R. 3005.
Many undecided lawmakers are saying they'll vote for TPA if they hear more
from business.  Your contacts with undecided lawmakers are urgently needed.
Encourage your employees to do the same.  Our TPA toolkit
(www.nam.org/tpatoolkit <http://www.nam.org/tpatoolkit>) has everything you
need (the list of undecided lawmakers, talking points, sample faxes, etc.).


YOUR INPUT NEEDED ON EPA PROPOSED NAAQS RULE
The NAM/industry lawsuit challenging EPA's 1997 particulate matter and ozone
rules prompted a federal court to send the ozone rule back to the agency to
consider the beneficial health effects of ozone.  EPA 11/14 proposed a new
rule, but said there's not enough evidence to relax the 0.08 parts per
million level in the 1997 rule.  We'd like you to review the rule and
provide feedback before the 1/14/02 comment deadline. It can be viewed at
www.nam.org/rer <http://www.nam.org/rer>, click "Air Quality Issues" then
"NAAQS."


FSC/ETI ORAL ARGUMENTS NEXT WEEK
On 11/26 Dep. Treasury Sec. Kenneth Dam and Justice Dept. attorney Kent
Jones will present oral arguments in defense of the ETI tax program
(formerly the FSC program) before a WTO dispute-settlement appeals panel.
U.S. and EU officials seek to avoid a trade confrontation and may look to
the new WTO round as a vehicle for resolving differences.  Rules approved at
the Doha ministerial meeting this week would be broad enough to accommodate
a solution if the two sides can agree.

that they favor a plan to suspend Social Security payroll taxes for one
month.

and optometrist John Boozman (R) to replace ex-Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-AR).
