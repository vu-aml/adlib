>
> Dear WildAlert Subscriber,
>
> National Forest roadless areas are *again* under attack from the Bush
> Administration and the U.S. Forest Service.  This time, the Forest
> Service is issuing yet another administrative "directive" that chips
> away at roadless area protections, protections Americans have voiced
> support for time and time again.  Please tell the Forest Service by
> NOVEMBER 19th that you strongly oppose the proposed "Categorical
> Exclusions" directive --
> http://www.wilderness.org/takeaction/?step=2&item=855
>
> CATEGORICAL EXCLUSIONS
> The latest Forest Service proposal would greatly weaken environmental
> review requirements for Forest Service management activities in
> National Forest roadless areas.
>
> Categorical Exclusions (CE) are used when a land management activity
> is believed to have an insignificant effect on the environment.  CEs
> can be used currently on a variety of activities, including relatively
> small logging and road-building activities.
>
> WHEN CEs CANNOT BE USED
> Until now, if certain extraordinary circumstances are present in the
> area in question, then CEs generally cannot be used.  Those
> circumstances include: inventoried roadless areas, threatened or
> endangered species habitat, municipal watersheds, Native American
> religious and cultural sites, or Research Natural Areas.
>
> PROPOSAL EXPANDS THE USE OF CEs
> The Forest Service proposal would change that, and allow the use of
> Categorical Exclusions for activities affecting these critical
> National Forest resources.  It reverses a long-standing agency policy
> originally set during the previous Bush Administration.
>
> Under the Forest Service's proposal, a broader range of activities
> that now require environmental review would be allowed in roadless
> areas under a Categorical Exclusion (i.e., without a review),
> including motorized trail construction, construction of utility lines,
> and some mining activities.
>
> TAKE ACTION
> The Forest Service is soliciting comments on this proposal, but only
> through NOVEMBER 19th.  We must let the Forest Service and the current
> Bush Administration know that the American people continue to pay
> attention to the environmental wounds that they are inflicting on our
> National Forests.  You can send your comments from
> http://www.wilderness.org/takeaction/?step=2&item=855 or tell the
> Forest Service directly:
>
> - That you strongly oppose the proposed directive.
>
> - National Forest roadless areas, endangered and threatened species
> habitat, municipal watersheds, Native American religious and cultural
> sites, and other special wildlands should be afforded the strongest
> possible protections.
>
> - Any project involving these resources should continue to have public
> involvement and must disclose impacts through preparation of an
> environmental impact statement.
