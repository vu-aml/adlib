Michelle - I asked for you to confirm that this didn't commit us to paying him a lump sum. Shelly/Sheila, do nothing with this until I have confirmed whether this has a lump sum attached to it. If it does we should tear it up.

Michelle / David:

Frank Stabler called to determine the status of his separation agreement amendment.  Bernadette Etienne, in Mary Joyce's Office, called to say that she received the amendment signed by Frank in their office and wanted to know what to do with it.  Should this document go to the Cash Mgmt Committee for authorization to execute?

I don't see this as a problem.  We'll handle it.  Michelle

By the way, I am confident that Jeff M will support it.

Michelle,

Is this something we need to check with lawyers on? Seems to make sense if Jeff and Jeff M agree we need to do this.

David / Michelle:

Today, Jeff Donahue requested that Frank Stabler's termination date, as reflected in his separation agreement, be extended from 12/01/01 to 12/31/01 due to his support on the CEG/CEG-RIO divestiture.  If approved, Michelle could you please generate a 2nd amendment to Frank's separation agreement.

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Thanks,
Shelly
