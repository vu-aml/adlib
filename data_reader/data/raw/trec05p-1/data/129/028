Rob, I have thought about this lately also.  We just can't lose all that history.  Let me check with Ken and we'll try to do it this month, but I don't want you to have a visitor  badge.

Rosie:

I have about 70 interviews on the Ken Lay and Enron story transcribed and in various states of revision, and of course the future of the project is now up in the air.

What I have on paper naturally tells a positive story about Ken individually and Enron.   I am concerned that all this will be lost given what has gone on in recent weeks and months and what will continue to go on in 2002 with legal matters.  One pitch I have is that I could finish the interviews and revisions focusing on the many positives before the merger to ensure that this record exists for posterity.

Could you prioritize a meeting with Ken to discuss what I have and where we could go with it in the future either internally or externally?  A lot of ideas are running through my head.  Cindy Olson is also involved with this, and I need to talk to Jim Derrick some  for the legal angle.  One or both of them could join us at the meeting if Ken would like--along with anyone else Ken would like to be there.

If this meeting is in December that will be fine, but I might have a visitor badge by then for all I know.

- Rob

P.S. I'm fine--hope you are too!
