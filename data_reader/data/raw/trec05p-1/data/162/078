Gridiron Guru 

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Tavis Butler, Richmond, VA 

I have Keyshawn Johnson, Kevin Johnson, Jerry Rice and Jimmy Smith. Which three of these WRs should I start in Week 13? 

Answer - GG 

Keyshawn leads the league in receptions (83), but still has no touchdowns. He's a risky start in TD-based leagues, but he's facing a subpar Detroit secondary and has a great chance to score his first TD this week. Kevin Johnson has been solid, and Smith is too good to bench. The odd man out here is Rice, who has played very well but is not as consistent. 


Question - Lou Spadone, New York City 

Which two of these RBs should I start: Antowain Smith, Dominic Rhodes, Charlie Garner, Larry Centers? Also, will Rod Smith play well against Seattle? If he doesn't play, would you start J.J. Stokes or Joey Galloway? 

Answer - GG 

Centers is definitely not an option. Smith has become a solid Fantasy player this season, so we'd start him. Garner has a good matchup vs. Kansas City, but we'd side with Rhodes over him. Rhodes will get every opportunity to produce, while Garner loses red zone carries to Zack Crockett. As for your second question, Smith is still hampered by ankle injuries, which makes him a risk. If he's not able to play, we'd go with Stokes, who has put up decent numbers in recent weeks. 


Question - Eric Mitchell, Durham, NC 

Who would you start this week: Corey Dillon or Duce Staley? 

Answer - GG 

Dillon hasn't rushed for over 100 yards since week seven, in large part because Cincinnati's passing game is sputtering. Staley and the Eagles offense looked sharp in Philly's win over Kansas City last week. They are using Staley effectively on offense, so start him over Dillon.

Tip of the Week 

Marc Sturgis, Plano, TX: Many football experts think that Emmitt Smith is all washed up, but he proved on Sunday that as long as he gets carries, he'll be productive. If he continues to get 25 carries per game, Emmitt will be a useful Fantasy player the rest of the season.
