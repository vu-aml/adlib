Poll: Americans split on Gonzales' future

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As Attorney General Alberto Gonzales prepares to testify before Congress Thursday about the firings
of several U.S. attorneys, a new CNN/Opinion Research Corporation Poll shows Americans are split over whether he should
leave office.

Thirty eight percent of Americans think the attorney general should resign, while 37 percent think he should remain in
his post. Another 24 percent were unsure what Gonzales should do. When asked if Bush should fire Gonzales, 31 percent
said yes, 36 percent answered no and 33 percent responded that they were unsure.

Gonzales' favorable rating was 28 percent, while 33 percent of Americans had an unfavorable impression and 39 percent
had neither a positive or negative view of him.

Gonzales has been criticized for the firing of eight U.S. attorneys allegedly for political reasons. The Senate
Judiciary Committee today is expected to question him extensively about his involvement as well as what role the White
House might have played in the dismissals.

"Most people aren't paying attention to this news story because it doesn't touch on any issue that affects them
directly," CNN's Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider said. "Most people haven't formed a firm opinion."

Poll: Former prez would be an asset to Sen. Clinton in White House

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A majority of Americans think former President Bill Clinton would be an asset to Sen. Hillary
Clinton, D-New York, should she win the race for the White House, according to a new CNN/Opinion Research Corporation
Poll.

If Sen. Clinton wins the Democratic presidential nomination and goes on to win the general election in 2008, 60 percent
of Americans believe her husband would have a positive effect on her administration, while 30 percent think it would be
negative. President Clinton served two terms as commander-in-chief.

Political Hot Topics
(Today's top political stories from news organizations across the country)

"WITH ANY OTHER PRESIDENT" THE AG "WOULD ALREADY BE GONE": When Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales's top aide
contemplated the mass dismissal of chief federal prosecutors two years ago, he advocated keeping the "loyal Bushies."
Two years later, the question confronting President Bush is whether to keep Gonzales, the very model of a loyal Bushie.
As Gonzales heads to Capitol Hill today for a long-anticipated public interrogation about the firing of eight U.S.
attorneys, at issue is the very concept of loyalty in Bush's world. With any other president, many in Washington say,
the attorney general would already be gone. Bush has defied the drumbeat from both parties to remove Gonzales, but even
the White House considers today's Senate hearing make or break. Washington Post: On the Hill, Gonzales Gets His Chance
at Redemption http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/18/AR2007041802573.html

WH, TOP DEMS "FAILED TO RESOLVE THEIR DIFFERENCES": After weeks of acrimonious sparring over financing the next phase
of the war, President Bush and Congressional leaders softened their tone on Wednesday but failed to resolve their
differences over a timeline for removing most American combat troops from Iraq next year. Mr. Bush met with a
bipartisan group of lawmakers in the White House for nearly an hour, the first face-to-face discussion since the House
and Senate passed emergency Iraq spending bills last month with provisions to end the war. Democrats said they would
send the president legislation by the end of next week, despite his pledge to veto it. "We believe he must search his
soul, his conscience, and find out what is the right thing for the American people," Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the
Democratic majority leader, told reporters after the meeting. "I believe signing this bill will do that." New York
Times: No Solution in Sight as Bush and Lawmakers Discuss Iraq Spending Measure

SCOTUS UPHOLDS PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION BAN: The Supreme Court broke new ground yesterday in upholding federal
restrictions on abortion, with President Bush's two appointees joining a court majority that said Congress was
exercising its license to "promote respect for life, including the life of the unborn." The court's 5 to 4 decision
upholding the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act passed by Congress in 2003 marked the first time justices have agreed that
a specific abortion procedure could be banned. It was also the first time since the landmark Roe v. Wade decision of
January 1973 that justices approved an abortion restriction that did not contain an exception for the health of the
woman. It does, however, provide an exception to save the woman's life. Washington Post: High Court Upholds Curb on
Abortion http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/18/AR2007041800710.html

'08ERS RESPOND: The Supreme Court decision upholding a federal ban on partial-birth abortion predictably pleased the
Republican presidential contenders and disappointed Democratic candidates. To the Republicans it was "a step forward"
and "correct"; to the Democrats it was "alarming" and a "dramatic departure." But partisans on both sides agreed the
decision is the beginning, not the end, of the abortion debate in the 2008 campaign. "This decision marks a dramatic
departure from four decades of Supreme Court rulings that upheld a woman's right to choose and recognized the
importance of women's health," said Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, New York Democrat and the perceived front-runner for
Democrats' presidential nomination. Washington Times: Ruling opens abortion debate for '08
http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20070419-122640-3800r.htm

SPOTLIGHT ON GIULIANI SHIFT: The former New York mayor and other top Republicans vying for the White House welcomed the
ruling while leading Democratic contenders said they deplored it. Giuliani, the only major GOP candidate who supports
abortion rights, has tried for months to mollify conservative critics. On Wednesday, he praised the court for upholding
the ban on the midterm procedure. "The Supreme Court reached the correct conclusion in upholding the congressional ban
on partial-birth abortion," Giuliani said in a statement. "I agree with it." His praise for the ruling contrasts his
position while seeking reelection as mayor in 1997. On an abortion rights group's questionnaire, he circled "yes" next
to the question of whether he would oppose "legislation that would make criminals of doctors who perform intact D&X
abortions" - the technical term for what critics call "partial-birth" abortions. Los Angeles Times: Giuliani shifts
stance on abortion method http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-abortpols19apr19,0,307359.story

DOOLITTLE'S HOME RAIDED... WIFE'S FUNDRAISING BUSINESS FOCUS OF SEARCH: FBI agents who raided Rep. John Doolittle's
Virginia home were searching for information about his wife's fundraising business, the congressman's attorney said
Wednesday. The FBI served a search warrant Friday on the Doolittle home, where Sierra Dominion Financial Solutions is
based. The raid wasn't the first time federal officials, engaged in an ongoing probe of political corruption stirred by
former lobbyist Jack Abramoff, sought records from the company. A grand jury investigating Abramoff, who last year
pleaded guilty to three felony charges of defrauding Indian tribes and corrupting political officials, also subpoenaed
Sierra Dominion records in 2004. Rep. Doolittle's attorney, criminal defense lawyer David Barger, said Wednesday that
Friday's raid stemmed from a search warrant for Sierra Dominion records and not anything directly related to the
congressman. Sacramento Bee: FBI raids Doolittle house http://www.sacbee.com/111/story/157657.html

POWERFUL EXECS GIVE TO BOTH PARTIES: "Double-dipping" -- giving donations to two political candidates in the same race
-- isn't uncommon, nor are contributions from chief executive officers. What's less common is when the double-dippers
are top executives giving to both parties. In the first three months of this year, at least 35 chairmen or chief
executive officers, including Verizon Communications Inc. CEO Ivan Seidenberg and Brady Spiean, who becomes head of
Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group next month, have contributed to both Republican and Democratic presidential
candidates, according to Federal Election Commission figures. These high-powered double-dippers have the means to make
the major donations sought by candidates across the political spectrum and may be more likely to focus on winning
powerful friends -- perhaps a future president -- than on ideology. Bloomberg: Credit Suisse, Verizon Executives Hedge
Bets for 2008 Campaign http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&sid=aQCwL9O4scdk

GIULIANI'S LEAD HAS "NARROWED CONSIDERABLY": Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's lead over his Republican
presidential rivals has narrowed considerably, while Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.) has maintained her advantage in
the race for the Democratic nomination, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. Sen. John McCain (Ariz.),
whose candidacy has been buffeted by lackluster fundraising and his embrace of President Bush's troop surge policy in
Iraq, runs a solid second among GOP hopefuls. But there is fresh evidence in the new survey that his focus on the war
and on attracting conservative support have made him more polarizing as a potential general-election candidate.
Giuliani remained the front-runner in the national poll, but his support has eroded. Washington Post: Giuliani's Lead
Shrinks, Clinton's Margin Holds http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/18/AR2007041801866.html

GOP LEFT "STARSTRUCK" AND "GUSHING" BY THOMPSON: Fred Thompson took the stage and gave a virtuoso performance Wednesday
during a private meeting with House Republicans — leaving many star-struck and gushing about the prospect of the former
Tennessee Republican senator running for president. His audience of 53 included five members of the House leadership.
"He was called presidential, and he was," said Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., who arranged the meeting. "He was told that he
is electable, and he is." Thompson skipped a repeat performance for the media, making brief comments after his one-hour
afternoon meeting at the National Republican Club of Capitol Hill. The Tennessean: Looking 'presidential,' Thompson
dazzles GOP http://tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070419/NEWS08/704190401

"THE SHARPTON PRIMARY": Democratic presidential contenders are scrambling for support in what's being dubbed the Al
Sharpton primary. The civil rights leader livened up the 2004 Democratic primary with his pompadour hairdo and sharp,
witty oratory. This election, the high-profile Sharpton, fresh from the fight over Don Imus' derogatory remarks, is
attracting all the party's major candidates this week for his annual National Action Network convention. The solid
attendance - starting with John Edwards on Wednesday and continuing with Sens.	      Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack
Obama later this week - reflects Sharpton's prominence in the party, concern that he might run again and the Democrats'
effort to appeal to the base, particularly black voters. No wonder the event was being called the Sharpton primary. AP

A STAFFER CONSPIRACY? That BlackBerry service blackout you heard so much about? HOH is developing a theory that it was
somehow a conspiracy cooked up by Hill staffers looking for a little respite from the grind of being in their bosses'
virtual clutches. Far from being angered by having their communications lifelines severed, staffers seemed thrilled to
get a break from constant buzzing when the service that keeps the e-mail flowing (and overflowing) into the handheld
devices of Hill denizens went down late Tuesday and early Wednesday. "It was the most peaceful night I have had during
session in years," one House staffer tells HOH. "Not only was my bar time uninterrupted, but my return home was calm
and my night of sleep peaceful." Another House-er called it "the most enjoyable 12 hours of my Congressional career."

CORZINE'S LIGHTS AND SIRENS "INAPPROPRIATE," SAYS NYC MAYOR: In light of New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine's horrific highway
crash, it's "totally inappropriate" for politicians to use lights and sirens to speed to photo ops, Mayor Bloomberg
said yesterday. The billionaire mayor said the billionaire governor's accident was a wakeup call for everyone to buckle
up and drive safely in nonemergency situations. "I don't think an elected official that wants to get to some place for
a photo op is appropriate," Bloomberg said. Corzine was heading to Princeton, N.J., for a meeting between fired radio
host Don Imus and the Rutgers University women's basketball team when he wrecked on a guardrail on the Garden State
Parkway. New York Daily News: I wouldn't drive like Corzine, says Mike
http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/04/19/2007-04-19_i_wouldnt_drive_like_corzine_says_mike.html

BLOOMBERG KNOCKS CRUISE PROCLAMATION: Mayor Bloomberg yesterday blasted official proclamations drafted by a city
councilman honoring Tom Cruise and Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard for their roles in promoting a detoxification
program for 9/11 rescue workers. "I don't think it's appropriate to do that," said the mayor, reacting to a report in
yesterday's Post. "I think that reputable scientists do not think Scientology has any basis in science. It may be a
cult, it may be a religion, it may be beliefs. It's other things, but it's not science, and we should only fund those
programs that reputable scientists believe will stand the light of day and the scientific method." Councilman Hiram
Monserrate (D-Queens) said he's honoring the New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project - co-founded by Cruise and
based on the theories of Hubbard - for providing free services that have improved the health of ailing rescue workers.
