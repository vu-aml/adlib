Darla:

The attached spreadsheet indicates proper billing for Citizens for June for the Griffith deal.  Remember we will bill this separately. I do not know how this deal was booked.  My guess is it will look different than the attached spreadsheet.  Kim is out this week so I will need to help resolve any issues that come up.   I will call to discuss.
