Hi. I'm Ashley =). I would be really happy if you can take a look at my website that I made. Its my personal page. I love it, its updated every few hours a day. I have my pictures, my webcam, and I have made some videos of my self. This page is free at no charge, but I am not allowed to have minors viewing it. That is why I have a verification system build in. Ones you get passed it, I am live. I am looking for a cyber friend. Cyber friendship, and who knows maybe even more ;D.
