For the time being, keep the PR groups sweet but make no commitments.  We need to obtain market commitments as a first priority, which Kevin is pursuing most diligently.  He should have more feedback in October.

Keep us on your 'to do' list and thanks for all your help!

Hi Eric and Kevin!

I have heard from the PR group in Tuscon and they are anxious to start working with us.  They actually mentioned partnering with the Phoenix firm, just like we tossed around.

Would ya'll like to get together to discuss what direction we head?  With an expected first quarter 2002 filing, I think we need to start identifying our stakeholders and getting in touch with them.   We'll need the PR firm to get things moving for us.

Thanks a million.

Gina
