Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Ahmed Abdalla, Director and Board Member,Transparency =
International ,Kenya. I got your email address from the web directory so I =
decided to contact you.
We are interested in diverting some funds currently floating in the suspense =
account of the federal pay office to your account as soon as possible.
Source of the funds are
:
During the Arap Moi's government, government=92s officials awarded contracts =
to their own companies, these contracts were grossly over invoiced. Now the =
present government set up contract review panel to settle those owed =
outstanding amount. My colleagues and I have identified a huge amount =
totaling US$ 370m (Three hundred and seventy million us dollars) oversea .

We would want US$43.8m (Forty three million Eight Hundred Thousand) dollars =
out this money oversea transferred to your account because we are not =
eligible to operate foreign account, and I have been mandated to search for a =
partner abroad. We really want this transfer made as soon as possible before =
the government, who have started refunding money from Moi's foreign accounts =
track this money.We will be offering 20% for your assistance.
If you would want to proceed with this transaction please reply with your =
name and phone number to(abdallamed200@netscape.net) and if you do not accept =
my offer please treat with utmost confidentiality.
