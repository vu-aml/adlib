Barry/Mark,

Please see the attached files for the 2002 direct expense plan.  The goal was to reach a combined plan of about $4,220,000.  The numbers included only add up to about $3,905,000 so we can discuss if and where to add the additional $315,000.  I'll try to reach you both at Mark's number around 9:00 Denver time (10:00 Houston time) tomorrow morning.
