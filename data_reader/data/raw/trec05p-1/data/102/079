KANSAS -- SW Bell seeks court review of LD rate decision

Southwestern Bell Communications Services, Inc. (SBCS) has asked 
the Kansas Court of Appeals to set aside a Kansas Corporation 
Commission decision regulating the company's long distance rates.  
SBCS is Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.'s long distance 
subsidiary.  The commission unlawfully asserted jurisdiction over 
SBCS's rates, the company said.  The KCC's decision is 
"unreasonable, arbitrary and/or capricious," SBCS added.

In March, AT&T Communications of the Southwest, Inc., asked the 
commission to suspend SBCS's tariff arguing that it was 
"unlawful, unduly preferential, and anticompetitive."  In April, 
the commission denied AT&T's request but concluded that SBCS was 
a "public utility" and, as such, the commission had the authority 
to investigate its rates.  The commission denied SBCS's requests 
to reconsider its decision.

SBCS is not a "public utility" because it doesn't own, control, 
operate, or manage any equipment, plant, or generating machinery 
for transmitting telephone messages, the company said.  SBCS said 
it should be regulated as a telecommunications "carrier."  State 
law prohibits the commission from regulating a carrier's long 
distance rates.  (Case 01-87901-A, Southwestern Bell 
Communications Services, Inc. v. Corporation Commission of the 
State of Kansas)

______________________________________________________

SOUTH DAKOTA -- Qwest to present long distance bid

Qwest Corp. has said that it plans to submit documentation with 
the Public Utilities Commission today that signals its intent to 
offer in-region interLATA (local access and transport area) 
service under section 271 of the federal Telecommunications Act 
of 1996.

The company is asking the commission to review documentation that 
demonstrates Qwest has opened up its in-region intraLATA market 
to its competitors.  Qwest said that it hopes the PUC will 
support its decision and "influence" the FCC with "a strong 
endorsement" of its filing.  

After the PUC reviews its proposal, the company plans to submit 
its bid to offer interLATA service in South Dakota to the FCC by 
early 2002.

______________________________________________________

NORTH CAROLINA -- KMC seeks tandem-interconnect rate

KMC Telecom III, Inc., has asked the Utilities Commission to 
require Carolina Telephone and Telegraph Co. and Central 
Telephone Co., d/b/a Sprint, to pay KMC the tandem-
interconnection rate for reciprocal compensation.  Sprint is 
paying KMC the lower end-office switching rate for reciprocal 
compensation.  KMC is seeking about $550,000 in reciprocal 
compensation fees from Sprint.

KMC said it's eligible for the tandem-interconnection rate 
because its switch (1) serves a geographic area comparable the 
area covered by BellSouth's tandem switch and (2) performs 
"tandem-like" functions.  (Docket P-7, sub 980; P-10, sub 622)

CONNECTICUT -- DPUC to accept WorldCom, SNET arbitration decision

The Department of Public Utility Control has issued a draft 
decision that would accept a revised final arbitration settlement 
between Southern New England Telephone Co. (SNET) and WorldCom's 
Connecticut operating companies--MCI Metro Access Transmission 
Services, Inc., and Brooks Fiber Communications of Connecticut, 
Inc.  The companies sought the arbitration after failing to agree 
on interconnection terms after their 1999 agreement expired.  The 
disputed issues included directory assistance, resale, unbundled 
network elements, reciprocal compensation, and collocation.

The DPUC partially remanded the arbitrator's initial decision 
last July to (1) clarify inconsistencies in language; (2) ensure 
compliance with the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996; (3) 
provide a time period for the consistency of cost studies, which 
the DPUC said was omitted; and (4) clarify the reasons supporting 
the award, in light of an "Eighth Circuit Decision vacating 
certain duties regarding unbundling of incumbent local exchange 
carriers."  The remainder of the award was affirmed.  (7/12/01)

The arbitrator issued a letter clarifying the language to make it 
consistent with the original ruling, stating that WorldCom should 
be billed a manual loop qualification charge when the loop 
qualification process isn't mechanized.  The arbitrator also 
determined that the companies should complete their cost studies 
within 60 days of the final decision's release.

The arbitrator declined to discuss his reasons for supporting the 
award because "such disclosure would be detrimental to the 
confidential nature of the arbitration process."  The DPUC 
accepted the arbitrator's assertion and said that it would base 
its ruling for this issue on the arguments made by SNET and 
WorldCom.

The DPUC will hold Nov. 6 oral arguments on the settlement.  
Parties that want to participate in the oral arguments must file 
at the commission by Oct. 31.  A final decision on the matter is 
expected Nov. 14.

NORTH CAROLINA -- Gov. Easley signs bill streamlining telcos' 
taxes

Gov. Mike Easley (D.) has signed a bill eliminating the franchise 
tax on telecom companies' gross receipts and making interstate 
calls subject to the state sales tax.

Most local calls are now subject to a 3% state sales tax and a 
3.22% franchise tax.  HB 571 eliminates the 3.22% franchise tax 
and replaces both taxes with a 4.5% sales tax.  About 24% of the 
proceeds from the new sales tax will be distributed to local 
governments. 

HB 571 also (1) taxes prepaid phone cards at the point of sale 
instead of the point of use and (2) authorizes state and local 
governments to tax wireless communications if the source of the 
communications is located in the state.  The "source" is 
considered the subscriber's service address.  HB 571 takes effect 
Jan. 1, 2002.

MARYLAND -- WorldCom calls for an end to Verizon's 'alt-reg' plan

WorldCom, Inc., has asked the Public Service Commission to 
terminate Verizon Maryland, Inc.'s current alternative regulation 
plan because the plan has "failed to comply with Maryland law."  
Under state law, the plan must foster competition.  WorldCom 
pointed out that FCC market share data shows that Verizon has 
retained 96% of the local market.  

The PSC said it would review Verizon's current alternative 
regulation plan in the sixth year of the plan--January 2002.

The General Assembly passed legislation in 1995 that granted the 
PSC authority to adopt alternative regulation plans if the plan 
(1) produces affordable and reasonable local exchange service in 
the state; (2) ensures quality, availability, and reliability of 
telecommunications services; (3) encourages competition; and (4) 
is "in the public interest."

WorldCom said that although Verizon's rates increased very little 
since the plan's inception, they are excessive, as shown by the 
incumbent's 33% return on equity.  That amount is double the 
returns before the plan was implemented, WorldCom said.  In 
addition, WorldCom asserted that local competition has been 
stymied by Verizon's legal challenges to unbundled network 
element (UNE) rates, UNE combinations, operations support systems 
(OSS) testing, interconnection arbitrations, and other legal 
battles.  

WorldCom blamed these "battles" for the bankruptcy of competitive 
local exchange carriers (CLECs) operating in the state, including 
PSINet, Inc., Teligent, Inc., e.spire Communications, Inc., 
NorthPoint Communications Group, Inc., and Rhythms Links, Inc.

WorldCom has asked the PSC to consider a new plan that would 
require Verizon to (1) provide network elements to competitors, 
(2) unbundle these elements in technically feasible combinations, 
(3) ensure that competitors gain access to network elements, (4) 
set UNE rates using a total element long run incremental cost 
methodology, (5) provide "commercially viable" OSS, and (6) 
provide a performance assurance plan.

WASHINGTON -- 1-800-RECONEX asks to leave market

1-800-RECONEX, Inc., has asked the Utilities and Transportation 
Commission for authority to cease doing business in the state.  
The company filed its application to withdraw its registration 
the day it was required to pay the commission a $166,000 penalty, 
a UTC staff member told TR.

RECONEX was fined $166,00 in September for failing to make 
agreed-upon improvements to its basic local telephone service.  
(9/20/01)  The company didn't pay the fine, the staff member 
added.

The staff member said the commission hasn't decided on the "best 
response" to the company's action.  RECONEX could face penalties 
of up to $1,000 per day for failing to pay the fine on time. 

The company also will be required to follow the commission's 
service-termination rules, which include notifying its customers 
of its plans to exit the market.

MAINE -- Carriers must file infrastructure, service area maps

The Public Utilities Commission has adopted rules requiring all 
utilities to submit service area and infrastructure data in 
geographic information systems (GIS) format for the state's 
database.  GIS format creates a database that can correlate 
utility data "indefinitely," a spokesman for the PUC told TR.  
System disruptions will be more easily responded to and recovered 
from by using GIS, he said.  The new format will force telecom 
companies in the state to modernize, the spokesman added.

The rules apply to incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs), 
competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) that the commission 
has designated as eligible telecommunications carriers (ETCs) 
pursuant to the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, and 
interexchange carriers (IXCs) with facilities in Maine.

The rules direct carriers to "maintain current service area maps" 
by updating files when boundaries change.  Initial copies are due 
from ILECs July 1, 2002, and from CLECs designated as ETCs on 
Apr. 1, 2004.  Utilities must file annual infrastructure maps by 
April 1 for infrastructure in place as of Dec. 31 of the previous 
year.  All submissions must be made using GIS format, unless the 
PUC authorizes a waiver.

A copy of the rules is available at 
http://www.state.me.us/mpuc/rules/Part%201/ch-140.pdf.  The 
commission order is available at 
http://www.state.me.us/mpuc/orders/2001/2001-284oar.htm.  (Docket 
2001-284)

MICHIGAN -- Law enforcement bill would allow wiretapping

Rep. Andrew Raczkowski (R., District 37) has sponsored HB 5240, 
which would give law enforcement officials the authority to 
intercept communications and use interception devices for drug 
trafficking offenses.  

A House Criminal Justice Committee spokesperson told TR that 
Michigan laws currently don't authorize state and local law 
enforcement officials to engage in wiretapping activities to 
fight crime.  He said that Michigan has no statutes on the 
subject at all.  The spokesperson added that if this measure were 
approved, it would limit law enforcement officials to "drug 
crimes" only.  

The committee spokesperson told TR that in the wake of the recent 
terrorist events, it was "very likely" that an amendment would be 
proposed to give law enforcement officials expanded power to use 
surveillance capabilities like wiretapping to combat domestic 
terrorism.

HB 5240 has been referred to the House Committee on Criminal 
Justice.  Other sponsors include Rep. Barb VanderVeen (R., 
District 89), Rep. Joanne Voorhees (R., District 77), Rep. John 
Pappageorge (R., District 41), Rep. John Stewart (R., District 
20), and Rep. Patricia Birkholz (R., District 88).

TEXAS -- PUC tentatively backs 'overlay' for '903' area code

The Public Utility Commission has tentatively recommended 
implementing an "overlay" to relieve number "exhaust" in the 
"903" area code.  Permissive 10-digit dialing should begin April 
20, 2002, with mandatory dialing starting Oct. 19, 2002, the PUC 
said.  The PUC will request comments on its plan, but hasn't 
established a comment schedule yet.

Without a relief plan, number resources in the 903 area code are 
projected to exhaust during first quarter 2003.  (6/21/01)  
(Project 22749)

TENNESSEE -- TRA to develop procedures for intercompany 
complaints

The Regulatory Authority has decided to develop rules 
establishing procedures for reviewing complaints between telecom 
companies.  The revised procedures would govern disputes about 
reciprocal compensation payments as well as other complaints, the 
TRA staff told TR.  (10/19/01)  The TRA will develop and request 
comments on proposed rules within the next two weeks, the staff 
told TR.

NEVADA -- Gov. Guinn names state CIO

Gov. Kenny Guinn (R.) has appointed Terry Savage the state's 
chief information officer.  He will be responsible for the 
guidelines, policies, coordination, and oversight of the 
technology used to process and move electronic information for 
state government.  Mr. Savage will report to the governor and 
will be the chairman of the Nevada Information Technology 
Operations Committee.

Mr. Savage joined the Department of Information Technology as 
deputy director in January 2000.  He was appointed director by 
Gov. Guinn in August 2000.

TEXAS -- AT&T launches call trace, repeat dial, call return 
features

AT&T Communications of Texas L.P. has launched call trace, repeat 
dial, and call return service.  The company charges $7 per use 
for call trace.  Repeat dial is available for 75 cents per use, 
and call return is available for 95 cents per use.

ALASKA -- UUI to change Lifeline eligibility criteria

United Utilities, Inc. (UUI) has filed a tariff revision with the 
Regulatory Commission to change its Lifeline qualification 
criteria.  UUI is a local exchange carrier in the state.

UUI proposed deleting a provision that said, "A customer who has 
more than one telephone line at a location or who has telephone 
service in the same name at another location is not eligible for 
assistance."  

The company wants to add a provision that states, "While a 
Lifeline customer may have more than one telephone line at a 
location or have telephone service in the same name at another 
location, only the primary residential service is eligible for 
Lifeline service."

Comments on the tariff revision are due Nov. 23.  (TA56-249)

WASHINGTON -- Technology institute launched

Gov. Gary Locke (D.) and state and local leaders yesterday 
formally launched the new Institute of Technology at the 
University of Washington, Tacoma.  The institute was established 
with more than $5 million in state funds in June, along with 
nearly $4 million from local government and private donors.  

The governor launched the state's Strategy for the Innovation 
Economy earlier this summer to ensure that "Washington becomes 
the state that technology-driven, fast-growing, high-paying 
businesses call home--the state where innovation is a way of life 
and technology is the tool that powers our prosperity."

The institute is one of several steps the South Sound region is 
taking to create a tech-based future.  Those steps include 
providing the bandwidth that technology-based companies demand.

The institute opened its doors this fall with 170 students 
working towards bachelor's degrees in computing and software 
systems.  Next year the institute plans to offer a professional 
master's degree and will add other degree and certificate 
programs soon.

MONTANA -- PSC seeks comments on PAP

The Public Service Commission has asked for comments by Nov. 1 on 
a report issued by a facilitator, Liberty Consulting Group, on 
Qwest Corp.'s performance assessment plan.  The PAP seeks to 
ensure that the local market remains open after Qwest receives 
authorization from the FCC to provide in-region interLATA (local 
access and transport area) service under section 271 of the 
federal Telecommunications Act of 1996.

The commission is part of a multistate group examining Qwest's 
plan.  The states used the PAP adopted by the Texas Public 
Utility Commission for Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. as a 
starting point.  The collaborative adopted Texas's two-tiered 
payment approach where Tier 1 payments go to competitive local 
exchange carriers and Tier 2 payments go to the states.  The 
collaborative eliminated the Texas plan payment caps on 
individual performance measures, restructured collocation 
payments, and raised Tier 1 performance measures classified at 
"medium" to "high."

The Liberty Group recommended several PAP changes in its report 
that would help Qwest meet its goals and "fall within what we 
construe as the FCC standards applicable for such plans."  For 
example, although the Liberty Group said the hard 36% penalty cap 
as proposed by Qwest was consistent with previous FCC decisions, 
the group recommended that the states include several cap-
movement principles.  (10/23/01)  

The report is available at 
http://www.libertyconsultinggroup.com/OSS_and_PAP/FINAL%20QPAP%20
REPORT.DOC.  (Docket D2000.5.70)

______________________________________________________

TEXAS -- Staff proposes revisions to 'slamming' rules

The Public Utility Commission staff has proposed revisions to the 
PUC's "slamming" rules.  Slamming is the unauthorized switch of a 
customer's preferred carrier.  The proposed revisions would (1) 
add verification requirements adopted by the FCC after the rules 
took effect, (2) add electronic LOAs (letters of authorization) 
as a verification method for switching telecom service, and (3) 
require telecom companies to submit change orders within 60 days 
after receiving a customer's verification.  

The PUC is slated to review the staff's proposed rules Nov. 1, 
but AT&T Communications of Texas L.P. asked the commission to 
postpone its decision so that the staff can conduct a workshop to 
discuss additional proposed revisions to the rules.  Some 
incumbent local exchange carriers have attempted to implement 
their own local slamming "penalties," often before there is a 
determination of whether an improper switch has occurred, AT&T 
said.  The revised rules should prohibit this "unreasonable and 
anticompetitive" activity, AT&T said.  (Project 24626)

NEW YORK -- PSC postpones Verizon number 'pooling' deadline

The Public Service Commission has extended the deadlines for 
Verizon New York, Inc., to "pool" unused 1,000-number blocks in 
the "646" and "347" area codes because of the September terrorist 
attacks in New York City.  Verizon said that the numbers which 
would "otherwise be available" are now in use for displaced 
customers and emergency services.

The PSC said the postponement was "consistent with recent 
actions. . .to suspend other regulatory requirements affecting 
Verizon in the wake of the World Trade Center attacks."  The 
commission further noted that the postponement allows Verizon to 
devote its full attention to the restoration efforts in New York 
City.

The 646 area code was originally slated to be pooled by Oct. 31, 
and the 347 area code was scheduled for pooling by Nov. 30.  Both 
deadlines are now extended to Feb. 28, 2002.

ILLINOIS -- Ameritech expands EAS

Ameritech-Illinois has announced that it is offering three new 
flat-rate plans that provide unlimited local service to its 
Illinois consumers.  The extended area service (EAS) plans allow 
consumers to make unlimited local calls within about 15 miles of 
their home calling area for $12.50.  

Ameritech said that customers can choose from their Economy, 
Sensible, or Complete Solutions calling plans that allow 
consumers to elect additional services and features that best fit 
their calling needs.  

"The competitive market means not only offering customers 
competitive pricing, but being sure that they are using the 
packages that fit their calling patterns," said Steve Dimmitt, 
vice president-marketing for SBC-Ameritech.

Verizon Communications, Inc., earlier this week, said that it was 
offering EAS service to more than 50 exchanges in Illinois and 
that it filed a request with the Commerce Commission to offer EAS 
service to another 23 exchanges.  

Under Verizon's plan, local calls to nearby communities would be 
priced at local usage-sensitive service rates.  The service has a 
$17.02 monthly fee plus a call-connection charge of 3 cents per 
call and a 1.8 cents-per-minute calling charge.  Costs for calls 
within the home exchange would remain the same; residential 
customers currently pay 3.4 cents per call with no per-minute 
calling charges.  Business customers currently pay a 1.88-cent 
call-connection charge and a 0.93 cent-per-minute call charge. 
These charges will be discounted 50% on weekends, holidays, and 
from 9 p.m.-8 a.m. weekdays.

SBC Communications, Inc., Ameritech's parent company, said that 
later this month Ameritech-Michigan would be expanding its EAS 
service and that Ameritech-Wisconsin would be introducing EAS 
service for the first time.

OHIO -- Earthlink, AOL launch broadband services

Earthlink, Inc., and AOL Time Warner, Inc., today separately 
announced that they were each offering high-speed Internet 
service to consumers in Northeast Ohio. Time Warner Cable 
networks will supply the broadband service to both companies.

Earthlink said that it would offer the broadband service 
initially for $41.95 a month for downstream speeds of up to 2 
megabits per second and upstream speeds of 384 kilobits per 
second.

AOL said customers who sign up for its high-speed service would 
pay $44.95 for unlimited use of their broadband account and $2.95 
for dial-up use.  Users that want unlimited use of their 
broadband account and unlimited dial-up from any location will 
pay $54.95 for the service.

Earthlink will now have access to about 386,000 households in 
Time Warner's Northeast Ohio service area, which includes 
Cleveland, Akron, Canton, and surrounding areas.

MASSACHUSETTS -- Forrester to hold forum on 'X Internet'

Forrester Research, Inc., an independent technology research 
firm, will hold its Executive Strategy Forum Nov. 7-9 in Boston.  
The forum will discuss the "X Internet," an "extended, executable 
Internet," considered the "next step" in technology, Forester 
said.

As the Internet expands, the firm explained, two new waves of 
innovation are already eclipsing the Web-- (1) an executable 
Internet that greatly improves the online experience and (2) an 
extended Internet that connects the real world.  Forrester has 
dubbed this the X Internet.

Issues will include new Internet applications, new combinations 
of hardware and software being developed, how the new Internet 
"paradigm" will improve customer relations, new technology skills 
companies should be prepared for, and a summary of vendors that 
could "lead the move toward the X Internet."

Speakers include Richard Belluzzo, president and chief operating 
officer of Microsoft Corp., Chet Huber, president of OnStar 
Corp., Dr. Jim Mitchell, vice president and director of Sun 
Laboratories and fellow for Sun Microsystems Inc., and Ray Ozzie, 
chairman and chief executive officer of Groove Networks, Inc.

UTAH -- Verizon Wireless launches digital service

Verizon Wireless has started offering digital service in St. 
George and Cedar City.  Digital service will provide customers 
with greater call clarity and security and longer battery life 
and talk time.  The new coverage is part of the company's $18 
million investment in the state during 2001.  Previously, Verizon 
only offered analog service in southern Utah.

WASHINGTON -- UTC reschedules PAP hearings

A Utilities and Transportation Commission administrative law 
judge has told TR that the commission has rescheduled its 
hearings on Qwest Corp.'s performance assessment plan (PAP) for 
Dec. 18-21.  TR incorrectly reported that the hearings were 
scheduled for Dec. 5-7 in its Oct. 22 edition.  The hearings were 
rescheduled Oct. 11. 

The PAP seeks to ensure that the local market remains open after 
Qwest receives authorization from the FCC to provide in-region 
interLATA (local access and transport area) service under section 
271 of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996.  The UTC is a 
part of a multistate collaborative examining the PAP.  The 
Liberty Consulting Group is working with the collaborative and 
released its report on Qwest's PAP earlier this week.  (10/23/01)  
The report was originally scheduled to be released Oct. 12.

GEORGIA, NEVADA, NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA, TENNESSEE -- 
Cingular rolls out 2.5G wireless service

Cingular Wireless has launched its GPRS (general packet radio 
service) Internet Express service in Las Vegas, the Carolinas, 
eastern Tennessee, and coastal Georgia (including Savannah, 
Augusta, and Brunswick).  The service is already available in 
Washington.  (8/28/01)  

Internet Express provides customers with "always on" access to 
the wireless Internet at speeds up to 10 time faster than current
