Hi Folks,

Our Footballguy Scott Luebke takes a look at this week's Upgrades,
Downgrades and Waiver Wire Picks.

Have a great week.

Joe

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Upgrades   By Scott Luebke


QB - Brett Favre - Favre continues to prove why he is one of the greatest
quarterbacks of all time.  Unlike the last few seasons, Favre remains
healthy and continues to put up consistent fantasy numbers on a weekly
basis.  With Bill Schroeder returning from an ankle injury, Favre's stock
continues to rise.

QB - Aaron Brooks - The inconsistent season of Aaron Brooks continues to
excite and disappoint fantasy owners.  With 347 passing yards and 2
touchdowns (Williams dropped a third touchdown) against the 49ers, Brooks
continues to be deemed a top 8 fantasy quarterback.  Keep him in your lineup
and live with the ups and downs.  Brooks could put up explosive numbers
during any game.

QB - Donovan McNabb - McNabb continues to impress and should only get better
with the development of his receiving crew.  With a favorable schedule for
the remainder of the season, look for McNabb to carry fantasy teams towards
the playoffs.  He has started to develop a quality connection with the
speedy James Thrash.  Also, McNabb is starting to develop a good balance
between staying in the pocket and scrambling for the first down.  Look for
these extra rushing yards to provide added scoring as we head towards the
fantasy playoffs.

QB - Jay Fiedler - Fiedler has topped the 200 yard barrier in each of the
last 4 games while finding the end zone 6 times.  With the development of
talented rookie Chris Chambers, Fiedler has found a big play threat that
should electrify the Miami offense.  With a favorable schedule for the
remainder of the season, look for Fiedler to post solid numbers.

QB - Jeff Garcia - Garcia has become a mainstay in the upgrades section.
Add another 4 touchdowns to his total.

RB - Marshall Faulk - He's back.

RB - Fred Taylor - Taylor is nearing his return to the lineup.  He should be
able to get a good tune up before the fantasy playoffs.  Let's hope he stays
healthy.

RB - Shaun Alexander - Wow!  266 rushing yards and 3 touchdowns make a good
case to remain the starter upon Ricky Watters return from injury.  Will
Holmgren be able to justify the benching of the team's running back of the
future.  I mean...running back of the present.  Sorry Ricky, but your time
appears up in Seattle.

RB - Duce Staley - Staley scorched the Vikings for 231 total yards and a
touchdown.  It appears that Staley is now at 100% health.  Keep in mind,
Staley has always been a streaky producer throughout his career.  With the
Eagles offense looking sharp, Staley will most likely have longer hot
streaks than cold streaks.

RB - Curtis Martin - Martin continues to look good on the season.  After
being mired in a mini scoreless slump, Martin totaled 3 touchdowns against
the Chiefs on Sunday.  With the winter weather approaching, quality running
backs like Curtis Martin will become more important.

RB - Dominic Rhodes - With Edgerrin James expected to miss the next 2 games
and possibly the remainder of the season, Rhodes steps into the starting
role.  Rhodes suffered a shoulder injury that forced him out of the first
half on Sunday.  However, he was able to return in the second half.  Look
for Rhodes to be a productive back in the second half of the season.  This
upgrade is not based on production, but rather opportunity.

RB - Jerome Bettis - The Bus continues to roll in yardage leagues, but he
has been rather disappointing in scoring leagues.  With just two touchdowns
on the season, basic scoring league owners must be frustrated with Bettis.
Don't worry, Bettis will get a fair share of touchdowns in the second half
of the season.

RB - Mike Anderson - The knee injury to Terrell Davis will make Mike
Anderson the team's starter once again.

RB - Maurice Smith - Smith continues to look strong as the feature back for
the Falcons.  Despite being held scoreless in the last 3 weeks, Smith
continues to post quality yardage numbers (83, 84 and 148 yards).  When the
Falcons become more efficient in the red zone with the passing game, Smith's
touchdown numbers will increase.

RB - Antowain Smith - 2 consecutive 100-yard games have Antowain Smith
owners jumping for joy and this deserves an upgrade.  Heck, if Antowain
Smith makes anyone jump for joy, it's gotta be good.  Heck, the Patriots
offense is producing and the defense is maintaining quality field position.
If the New England defense continues to play well and keep the Patriots in
the lead, Smith will have a quality finish to the season.

WR - Marvin Harrison - Harrison scorched the Dolphins for 174 yards and 3
touchdowns on Sunday.  With Edgerrin James likely out for the remainder of
the season, Harrison and the passing game will become the focal point of the
offense.  The return of Jerome Pathon should keep the pressure off of
Harrison.

WR - David Boston - 4 consecutive 100-yard receiving games and pure
dominance at the wide receiver position.  Once again, I will proclaim Boston
as the best young receiver in the game of football.  If the Arizona offense
improves efficiency, Boston's touchdown numbers will rise dramatically.

WR - Willie Jackson - "Slick" Willie appeared invisible for a few weeks, but
Sunday's 11 catches for 167 yards deserves the upgrade.  Because of his
effectiveness, look for Brooks to find Jackson more often.  In addition,
Brooks appears to be showing signs of improvement and poise in the pocket.

WR - Chris Chambers - Chambers showed his big play potential on Sunday and
scored his first two touchdowns on the season.  Keep in mind, Chambers will
most likely be an inconsistent choice at receiver for the remainder of this
season.  However, he is a great option for dynasty or keeper leagues.

WR - Bill Schroeder - Schroeder returned from an ankle injury and scored a
touchdown in addition to his 100 yards receiving.  Before his injury,
Schroeder was one of the most consistent producers at the wide receiver
position.  Look for that trend to continue as long as he remains healthy.

WR - Joe Horn - Horn has started to show signs of why he was drafted so high
this season.  With games of 121, 83 and 99 yards, to go along with 4
touchdowns, Horn is making patient fantasy owners very happy.  Keep him in
your lineup.

WR - Terrell Owens - 100 yards receiving and 2 more touchdowns.  News
flash...Owens is really good.

WR - James Thrash - Thrash is assuming the role of #1 receiver in
Philadelphia and that's a good thing with a quality talent like Donovan
McNabb at quarterback. 2 more touchdowns on Sunday increase Thrash's total
to 7 touchdowns on the season.  With Todd Pinkston struggling on the
opposite side, McNabb continues to look in Thrash's direction more often.



/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/



Downgrades

QB - Brian Griese - Griese has been looking good, but the ankle injury to
Rod Smith has me worried a little bit.  Smith's ankle is something that
needs to be watched, especially with Eddie Kennison claiming that he wants
to retire.  If Rod Smith is unable to play, it may be wise to bench Griese,
if you have a viable backup option.

QB - Trent Green - Well, a healthy Derrick Alexander would have made this a
better season for Green.  With two consecutive games held under 150 yards,
Green once again is downgraded.  With a thin receiving crew at his disposal,
Green will continue to be a shaky start.  If Alexander can return healthy
after the bye week, Green could produce quality numbers down the stretch.
For now, start someone else at quarterback.

QB - Rob Johnson - A broken clavicle will keep Johnson out for 3-5 weeks.

QB - Ryan Leaf - Leaf is not the answer to your fantasy team's problems.  If
you're starting Ryan Leaf, your fantasy team must be really bad.  Time to
play for next year, if you're in a keeper league.

QB - Michael Vick - Vick remains a year or two away from becoming a viable
fantasy quarterback option.  He continues to struggle with reading the
defense.  On a good note, Vick threw for his first touchdown pass this past
Sunday.

RB - Edgerrin James - The knee injury to James appears to be more serious
than first thought.  The knee injury will keep James out for another two
weeks and possibly the remainder of the season.  Make sure you have Dominic
Rhodes on your roster.  This is a big blow to Edgerrin James owners.

RB - LaDainian Tomlinson - Tomlinson's struggles continue as opposing
defenses have learned to shut down the Chargers running game.  After a
glorious start to the season, Tomlinson has been on a gradual slide.  It's
only a matter of time before Tomlinson returns to the upgrades list.  Don't
bail out on Tomlinson just yet.

RB - Terrell Davis - Davis injured his left knee on Sunday and will likely
miss the next two games and possibly more. Davis will have arthroscopic knee
and will miss Sunday's game against Washington and most likely the following
week's game against Dallas. With the fragility of Davis lately, this is not
a good sign.

RB - Lamar Smith - Smith continues to struggle.  He has been held under 55
yards for the 4th consecutive week.  With Travis Minor starting to take a
few carries away from Smith, Smith owners need to start worrying a little
bit.  This week's game against the Jets could help signify the remainder of
the season for Smith.

RB - Travis Henry - Henry and the Bills running game continue to struggle.
Henry has been held under 65 yards in each of the last 4 games.  Keep him on
your bench until he begins to produce.

WR - Muhsin Muhammad - Muhammad showed signs of life on Sunday with 75 yards
receiving.  Keep in mind, the majority of this yardage was gained while the
Rams held a commanding lead.  With Matt Lytle at quarterback, no Panthers
receiver should be started.

WR - Eric Moulds - 3 catches for 7 yards and an injury to the starting
quarterback.  Moulds is currently sharing the title of most disappointing
fantasy receiver with Randy Moss this season.  Yuck!

WR - Darnay Scott - Scott suffered a concussion in Sunday's game against the
Jaguars and was shut out on the day.  Concussions sometimes linger with
receivers, so this deserves a little bit of watching.  He is expected to be
ready for next week's game.

WR - Rod Smith - Smith suffered an ankle injury in Sunday's game versus the
Chargers.  It is not yet known whether the injury will keep Smith out of
action, but it will most likely keep him from performing at his normal 100%.
This situation bears watching.  Joe's email updates will keep you updated on
this one.

WR - Todd Pinkston - Pinkston continues to struggle and it may be only a
matter of time before he loses the starting role to Freddie Mitchell.  If
you are a Pinkston owner, it may be a wise decision to grab Mitchell, if you
are in a deep league.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Waiver Wire

Keep in mind, the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of 12 and 14
team leagues.

QB - Alex Van Pelt - With Rob Johnson out for 3-5 weeks, Van Pelt will step
in and be given a chance to perform.  Keep in mind, Van Pelt scorched the
Jets for 268 yards and 3 touchdowns earlier this season.  He may be worth a
shot.

QB - Drew Bledsoe - Bledsoe has been cleared to play.  However, Tom Brady is
expected to remain the starter.  Make sure you have Bledsoe on your team, if
you have Brady.

RB - Dominic Rhodes - The primary backup to the injured Edgerrin James. He
will be a quality option for the remainder of the season in the Colts
offense.  James' owners should already have Rhodes on their roster.

RB - Travis Minor - Minor displayed his explosive running skills against
Indianapolis on Sunday.  He's gradually taking a few carries away from Lamar
Smith.  With Smith struggling, Minor could see his role expand.  Minor is
very similar to Warrick Dunn.

RB - LaMont Jordan - Jordan has gotten 17 carries in the last 2 weeks.
Because of his effectiveness, he'll continue to see 5-10 carries per week.
If Martin befalls injury, Jordan would be explosive.

RB - Troy Hambrick - Hambrick continues to produce with the absence of
Emmitt Smith.  It is not apparent how long Smith will be out of action, but
Hambrick is a good option for right now.

WR - Chris Chambers - Chambers showed his big play potential on Sunday and
scored his first two touchdowns on the season.  Keep in mind, Chambers will
most likely be an inconsistent choice at receiver for the remainder of this
season.  However, he is a great option for dynasty or keeper leagues.

WR - Keith Poole - With Rod Smith injured (ankle) and Eddie Kennison
pondering retirement, the Broncos will need Poole to enter the starting
lineup and produce.  Poole is not the flashiest receiver, but he has the
ability to be productive in the Denver offense.

WR - Freddie Mitchell - Mitchell continues to see more and more action in
the Eagles offense and deserves consideration for a second half pickup.
Grab him, especially if you are in a keeper league.

WR - Jerome Pathon - Many fantasy owners dropped Pathon a few weeks ago, but
he is healthy now.  With the loss of Edgerrin James in the Colts offense,
look for the Colts to pass more often.  Pathon could be valuable down the
stretch.
