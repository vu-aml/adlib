NEW JERSEY DEMOCRATS WIN SUPPORT OF SIERRA CLUB:
NATION'S OLDEST AND LARGEST ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP ENDORSES
40 DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATIVE CANDIDATES

The New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, the nation's oldest and largest 
environmental group, has officially endorsed 40 Democratic candidates 
running for Senate and Assembly in this year's election, suggesting that 
after eight years of Republican rule, New Jersey's environment cannot 
withstand four more.

"After eight years of failed Republican leadership and an administration 
that has weakened environmental standards, it's time for a change," stated 
Assembly Democratic Leader, Joe Doria (D-Hudson).  "And Democrats can bring 
about the right kind of change."

Acknowledging that there is an inherent need to curb sprawl throughout New 
Jersey, Democrats support implementing the State Plan, preserving open 
space, rebuilding existing communities, empowering municipalities to manage 
growth and making smarter investments in transportation.

Democrats are also placing air and water quality amongst their top 
priorities.  Democrats will protect air quality by requiring new cars sold 
in New Jersey to be cleaner and by investing in renewable energy and 
conservation programs. Democrats are also concerned with protecting drinking 
water by improving water quality and supply.  However, a key component of 
these Democratic proposals is to strengthen the New Jersey Department of 
Environmental Protection and restore the Public Advocate.

"The Public Advocate is integral in the fight to protect our environment," 
said Senate Democratic Leader, Dick Codey (D-Essex). "Whether it is the 
wetlands, coastal waters or the Pine Barrens, New Jersey plays host to a 
delicate ecosystem.  The people of New Jersey need someone they can rely on 
to fight for them when the environment of our State is threatened."
