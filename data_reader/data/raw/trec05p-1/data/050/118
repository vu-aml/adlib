Dear Member:

I have just one Best Bet among the College games still scheduled this weekend and there
is a strong possibility that the one Best Bet will be cancelled as well later today.

***LSU (-6 ½)  30   Auburn  13
LSU gave me an easy 48-17 Best Bet winner against Tulane two weeks ago and I'll come back
with them here against an Auburn team that has beaten them the last 2 years. Auburn has
been impressive thus far, beating Ball State 30-0 as a 20 ½ point favorite to open the
season and then opening up a 27-0 lead on Mississippi last week before allowing 3 late
Rebels touchdowns to make the final score (27-21) closer than the game really was. Auburn
does indeed have a very good defense and could be even better than last year's unit that
allowed just 3.4 ypr and 6.3 ypp. Clearly, Auburn is better along the defensive front
this year with 5 returning starters among the front 7 and the addition of DE James
Callier, who missed the last 2 years with injuries but appears to be the Tigers' best
defender. LSU has a good rush attack this season with improved sophomore running backs
Toefield and Henderson running behind a solid offensive line. LSU averaged only 3.5 yards
per rush last year, but I expect them to average about 4.5 ypr this season. While LSU
won't find it too easy to run today, they will be able to move the ball through the air.
Tigers' quarterback Rohan Davey is a special player and was on his way to a great season
last year before getting injured. Davey completed 66% of this 84 passes a year ago for
8.9 yards per pass and 10 TD's against just 1 interception. Davey is enjoying similar
success this season, averaging 9.1 yards per pass with no interceptions, and I expect him
to be able to throw effectively against an Auburn secondary that is good but not great.
Auburn's mediocre offense will have trouble keeping up against an LSU defense that I rate
a bit higher than Auburn's strong unit. The War Eagles will be starting redshirt freshman
quarterback Jason Campbell in his first road game and he will struggle against a veteran
LSU secondary that allowed only 5.8 yards per pass last season and 5.8 ypp so far this
year. Campbell has done a decent job in his 2 starts at home, throwing for 7.4 yards per
pass, but facing LSU on the road will be much more difficult than taking on Ball State
and Mississippi at home. Auburn has averaged only 3.8 yards per rush against two teams
that are not good defending the run, so I don't see them running the ball on an LSU
defensive front that returns their entire starting defensive front 7 from last year and
will be extremely tough to run on this year (allowing 2.8 ypr so far this year). LSU has
lost to a superior Auburn team the last two years, but things will turn around this year
as LSU has the match-up advantages, the home field and qualifies in a 167-97-4 ATS early
season indicator that is already 12-6 this season.
