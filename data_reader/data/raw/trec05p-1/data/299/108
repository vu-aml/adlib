Dearest,
With due respect, trust and humility, I write you this proposal, which I believe, would be of great interest to you. I found your contact while I was doing a private research on the internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that will assist me and my family. I am MRS.JANE ROSSMAN the wife of MR.KENNETH ROSSMAN (late) of Zimbabwe.

During the current war against farmers in Zimbabwe and from the support of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country, all the white farmers were ordered to surrender their farms to his party members and his followers. My husband who was one
of the best farmers in our country and treasury of the farmers’s co-operation did not support his idea and so the party members invaded my husband’s farms and burnt everything in the farm, killed my husband and made away with a lot of items in my husband’s farm.

After the death of my husband, my children and I decided to move out of Zimbabwe because of our lives were in danger with the money that my husband kept in his hidden safe in my house. The amount contained in the safe in my house is US$12m(Twelve million US Dollars)  and we decided to  move to the Republic of South Africa where we deposited the money in a Security Company as a valuable item. So I decided to make contact with an overseas firm whom will assist me to move this money out of South Africa, because we are asylum seekers here in South Africa.

So if you consider this proposal, we have agreed to give you 25% of the total sum for helping us to move this money out to your country and 10% will be mapped out for expenses both of us may incur during this transaction and 65%will be for me and my family to invest in your country. All I want is for you to furnish me with all your banking details and your personal phone and fax numbers for easy communication. You can contact my son PRINCE ROSSMAN (Mr) on the above telephone number. NOTE:  hat this transaction is 100% risk free and absolutely confidential.

Thanks and God bless you.

Best Regards,

JANE ROSSMAN (MRS)

(For The Family)
