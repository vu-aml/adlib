          Background:

     	    On May 22, 2001, Calpine Corporation and Bechtel Enterprises
Holdings, Inc., known as the Calpine/Bechtel Joint Development filed an
Application for Certification (AFC) with the Energy Commission seeking
approval to construct and operate a 600-megawatt (MW), natural gas-fired,
combined-cycle electric generating facility in the City of Hayward.

          On July 11, 2001, the Energy Commission began its 6-month review
of the AFC to determine whether the project will comply with all applicable
laws. The Informational Hearing scheduled in this Notice is sponsored by the
Energy Commission to inform the public about the project and to invite
public participation in this review.

          Project Description:

          The Russell City Energy Center (RCEC) project site is located in
the Industrial Corridor of the City of Hayward, Alameda County, California.
The proposed 14.7-acre project site is located at the southwest corner of
the intersection of Enterprise Avenue and Whitesell Street, directly south
of the City of Hayward's Water Pollution Control Facility.

          The proposed project consists of: two "F-Class" combustion
turbine-generators; two multi-pressure, supplementary-fired heat recovery
steam generators; a single, 3-pressure, reheat, condensing steam
turbine-generator; and a hybrid, wet/dry plume-abated, mechanical draft
cooling tower.

          Related facilities include: a 230-kilovolt (kV) on-site
switchyard; approximately 1.1 mile 230-kV, double-circuit, overhead
transmission line (this line would connect the RCEC switchyard; to the
existing Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) Eastshore substation via PG&E's
existing Eastshore-to-Grant 115-kV transmission corridor); approximately 0.9
miles of underground natural gas pipeline that would extend from PG&E's gas
distribution line 153 to the RCEC site; approximately 100 feet of new
domestic water/firewater pipeline from the existing City water main under
Whitesell Street; and approximately 2,000 feet of new industrial wastewater
discharge pipeline.

          Purpose of the Informational Hearing:

          Licensing of the proposed RCEC and related facilities is under the
Energy Commission's jurisdiction.  The power plant certification process,
which contains requirements equivalent to those under the California
Environmental Quality Act, will examine all relevant engineering and
environmental aspects of the proposed project. This process provides a
public forum allowing:

                    - Applicant,
                    - Energy Commission Staff,
                    - interested parties,
                    - governmental agencies,
                    - landowners, and
                    - members of the general public

to consider the relative advantages and disadvantages of the project, and to
propose changes or alternatives to the project as necessary.

          At the Informational Hearing, any of the foregoing participants
will have an opportunity to obtain information and to offer comments on the
AFC. (Copies of the AFC can be obtained at your local library). Applicant
will explain plans for developing the proposed site and related facilities.
Energy Commission Staff will explain the administrative licensing process
and their role in reviewing the application. Applicant and Energy Commission
Staff will also discuss proposed schedules and possible issues that may be
significant during this proceeding.


                       II. PROPOSED SCHEDULES AND ISSUE STATEMENTS

          In order to assist participants in understanding the project,
Staff is directed to prepare and serve upon those listed on the Proof of
