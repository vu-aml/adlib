Good morning my darling, 

I hope you slept well despite your dreams. Hopefully the doctor will give you some more mecine. 
I love you so much. I don't know what I'm going to do without you this weekend. I will miss you terribly. I wish we could move tomorrow, I'm so excited to see what our future holds for us and I am so very lucky to have you in my future.

By the way, did I tell you that I love you? Just in case I didn't... 

I LOVE YOU!!!! 

Have a good day sweetheart. I'll see you tonight for dinner. 

I miss you. 

Craig.
