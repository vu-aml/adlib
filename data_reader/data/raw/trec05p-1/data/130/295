Subject: [Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Edgerrin James 2nd Opinion No Better Than 1st

Knee Injury Sidelines James for Rest of Season

The second opinion sought by Edgerrin James on his damaged left knee, and
obtained in the last few days, has confirmed the worst -- the Indianapolis
Colts star tailback is out for the remainder of the season.

ESPN.com has learned through various league sources, including several close
to the two-time league rushing champion, that James has been apprised he
will require surgery to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament.

That determination was made by noted South Florida orthopedic surgeon John
Uribe, the second specialist to examine James' knee. James, who was injured
in an Oct. 28 game at Kansas City, has missed Indianapolis' last two games.

ESPN's Chris Mortensen first reported Monday that James was likely out for
the year.

The team's first-round pick in the 1999 draft, James, 23, had played in 38
consecutive games until the injury.

While club officials continue to concede only that James will miss the next
2-3 weeks and suggested reports he is lost for the rest of the season are
premature, the tailback has told several teammates his 2001 campaign is
over.

Although the timing could change, James tentatively plans to confirm the
injury and announce details of the surgery and for his subsequent
rehabilitation at a press conference next Tuesday.

A date for the surgery, which will be performed by Dr. Uribe, has not yet
been set. But the rehabilitation period is expected to be 6-8 months and
could mean that James will not be totally rehabilitated in time for the
start of training camp next summer.

James is familiar with Uribe, the team doctor at the University of Miami,
where the Colts tailback played collegiately, and apparently has great faith
in his judgment.

The fourth overall player selected in the '99 draft, James led the league in
rushing as a rookie (1,553 yards) and then again for the 2000 season (1,709
yards). His total of 3,262 yards is the second-most ever by a player in the
first two seasons of his career.

Confirms what we reported to you earlier from ESPN's Chris Mortensen.

Here's what Bill Polian said after it was first reported James was done for
the season three days ago:  "So I turned my computer on. I read the report
on ESPN and I just kind of chuckled. I don't know where they get this
information.   "It (the report) is a lot of uninformed speculation from
people who are uninformed,"

Evidently, we weren't as uninformed as he thought...

What this means for you is that Dominic Rhodes has a chance to shine.   He's
got a nicked shoulder but is reportedly set to play this weekend and will be
looking to make the most of his opportunity.   Keep a close eye on this one.

Thanks to Footballguy Joe Profaizer for pointing me to this one.
