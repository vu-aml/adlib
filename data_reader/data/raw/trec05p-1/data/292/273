Only seventeen million dollars was kept here in our
bank from their business with a wealthy diamond
merchant from Seirra Leona.His father was one of the
close confidants of Mr Sani Abacha(the late military
president of our country) whom he did business with.I
have all documents related to their fund transfer in our
bank at the present situation now. After a favorable response,
I then send you a copy of my passport and bank id, I
will expect you to send yours so that we can be sure
of ourselves and know if we can do this together. All
I require from you is an offshore bank account details which
can carry this funds.I will only fill it in for payment as the 
beneficiary of the funds. Do not worry about anything,
it is 100% risk free. I will involve a lawyer who will
get a power of attorney for the change of beneficiary,
I sign and he will represent you here in bank to sign
the funds off to your account since you may not be
able to make under such short notice. The documents of
transfer will be sent to you through email attachement
for cover and evidence should your bank ask
questions before my arrival to your country. We shall
be through in roughly one week to complete the
transfer and after everything, you shall have 30%
of the total sum, while 70% for me. I hope and pray that we can work together in all honesty and being truthful even when the funds enter your account. If you are truly serious like I said send me first the follows;
