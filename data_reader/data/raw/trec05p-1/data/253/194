Barbara, 

Attached hereto is a spreadsheet sent to us by George Gilbert (former Enron trader now with UBS) calculating Kona's losses in certain hedging contracts with ENA.  This spreadsheet was the basis of our claim in the bankruptcy proceeding.  I hope that this will expedite getting are LC back.  Thank you for your time and assistance in this matter. 

Regards,
