In regard to our meeting yesterday, detail for lockbox information is not received until mid afternoon the day after deposits are made. The detail for the 72,107.31 deposit will not be received until sometime this afternoon.  This amount is yesterday's deposit, 2/19.  Also, as discussed in yesterday's meeting your request for detail on the $36,513.47 2/1 item is an "ACT Transfer CR", and is not an incoming wire. It will not be recorded as an incoming payment. In prior discussions and emails,  we have indicated the $350.00 on 2/1 is a  NON TRADE item; the $600.00 on 2/12 is a NON TRADE item.  The $40,807.85 wire received 2/15 from FPL is for customer 700000031, and was applied to the appropriate misc invoices on 2/19.

In the future in viewing deposit amounts for the lockboxes and we indicate there are no trade deposits, the items will be treated as Non Trade items. 

I trust this will resolve the outstanding questions.

thanks,

sandy

Sandy,

I've highlighted Gerry's questions in red bold below.  Just let me know if you find anything.  He also references some Feb 1st info.  I thought it was decided that these were not trade transactions????
