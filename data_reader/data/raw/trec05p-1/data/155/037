Steve, 

I know that these are trying times for you.  Just
wanted to let you know that I am pulling for you in
these difficult times.  If there is anything that I
can do to help you please let me know.  You
encouragement and support meant so much to me this
past summer that I just had to send you this quick
note of support.  

Sincerely Yours

Bob Lane
