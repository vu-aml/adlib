Attached are drafts of two memos I would like to circulate regarding EBS matters.  One relates to Legal Risk Memos and one relates to legal review of contracts.  I am also preparing one for contract retention.  Would you please let me know if you have any comments?  With respect to risk memos, I understand you announced on Thursday that there are 4 buckets you wanted referenced.  Unfortunately, as you know, I missed Thursday's presentations.  Thanks.  Lance.
