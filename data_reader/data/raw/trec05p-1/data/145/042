Jeff,

Yes, Rick received your tuition reimbursement form, signed it, and I forwarded it for payment.  I'm not sure how long it takes for payment, so let me know if I need to research the whereabouts of your reimbursement.

Have a great holiday!!!

Hello:

*	First, forget it all and have a wonderful holiday.

*	Second, given the immense challenges, I've been instructed to get major expenses in and paid.  So I sent to Rick in a confidential folder my tuition reimbursement form for school.  Do you know if he got it?

Best,
Jeff
