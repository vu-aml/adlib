COVER STORY
*CONFUSED ABOUT EARNINGS? <http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_48/b3759001.htm?c=bwinsidernov16&n=link1&t=email>
There are no rules for calculating operating earnings--the number investors watch--as there are for net profits, which are filed with the SEC. So companies are making up their own rules about what to add and what to leave out, and calling the result "earnings." That makes it impossible for investors to compare companies and threatens the credibility of the U.S. financial system. Here's what should be done--and what investors need to know.
