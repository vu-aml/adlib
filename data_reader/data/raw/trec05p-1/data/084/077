SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVES NOMINATION OF SCALIA FOR LABOR
SOLICITOR

By a vote of 11-10, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and
Pensions Committee approves President Bush's nomination of
Eugene Scalia to hold the Labor Department's top legal
position. Sen. Jeffords (I-Vt.) is the sole member of the
Democratic caucus to vote in favor of Scalia to be solicitor
of labor.

In discussion before the vote, Democrats protest the
nomination, citing Scalia's written positions on a number of
issues, including workplace safety, discrimination, and
child labor. Republicans on the committee respond that
Scalia's record shows nothing but the successful career of
an aggressive lawyer.

The committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Gregg (R-N.H.) ,
says Scalia has "a brilliant mind" and is "exactly what we
should be looking for" in a public servant. Bush's
nomination of Scalia, an employment lawyer and partner in
the Washington, D.C., office of Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher,
has drawn criticism from congressional Democrats and the
AFL-CIO, largely due to his critical views of the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration's effort to
regulate ergonomics in the workplace. . . . Page AA-1

NLRB REAFFIRMS MERE NEGLIGENCE IN HIRING HALL REFERRAL NOT
ILLEGAL

On remand from an appeals court, the National Labor
Relations Board reaffirms its previous view that a union's
inadvertent errors in operating an exclusive hiring hall do
not violate the union's duty of fair representation or
constitute an unfair labor practice ("Steamfitters Local 342
(Contra Costa Elec. Inc.), "336 N.L.R.B. No. 44, 9/28/01
[released 10/15/01]). The board first ruled 4-1 in September
1999 that Steamfitters Local 342 did not act illegally by
mistakenly referring several lower-priority workers to a
construction project, ahead of union member Joe Jacoby.
However, the District of Columbia Circuit reversed and
remanded the case, directing the board to reconsider its
reasoning.

In its second decision, the board again rules the
Steamfitters' mistake in not referring Jacoby right away did
not violate the union's duty of fair representation or
constitute an unfair labor practice because the mistake was
not deliberate. The board again overrules its 1992 decision
in "California Erectors" and other later decisions that take
an inconsistent view. The board relies on board decisions
prior to 1992, instead of the two Supreme Court decisions it
relied on in its first decision in the case. . . . Page A-6

ASSISTANCE PLAN TARGETED TO WORKERS 'IN NEED,' CHAO SAYS

Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao tells the House Education and
Workforce Committee that President Bush's recent plan to
assist dislocated workers is an "extremely nimble" proposal,
one that is "targeted at workers in need." Bush has
announced plans to make available a new package of
unemployment insurance benefits and emergency grants for
states hard hit by job losses related to the disaster. Labor
Department estimates put the cost of the 13 weeks of
additional unemployment insurance benefits, which would be
available for an 18-month period, at between $5 billion and
$8 billion.

 The benefits would be available to those who have exhausted
their 26 weeks of regular unemployment insurance in states
where the total unemployment rate has increased 30 percent
above the Sept. 11 level. According to Labor Department
calculations, between 2.2 million and 2.3 million unemployed
workers would receive assistance under the new program, Chao
says. Bush also has proposed that $3 billion of the $40
billion emergency supplemental appropriations be made
available in the form of national emergency grants to states
experiencing mass layoffs or plant closings. These grants
could be used as cash payments for workers to pay health
care premiums, cover job training costs, or extend financial
assistance to those who otherwise are not  eligible. . . .

COURT DENIES CLASS CERTIFICATION IN RACE CASE AGAINST
GEORGIA UTILITY

A federal judge in Atlanta denies class certification in a
race discrimination lawsuit against Atlanta-based electric
utility the Southern Co. and its subsidiary Georgia Power
Co., ruling that the claims of the potential class members
were not sufficient to show a widespread pattern and
practice of discrimination ( "Cooper v. Southern Co., "N.D.
Ga., No. 1:00-CV-2231, 10/11/01 ).

In a 90-page opinion, Judge Evans of the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Georgia also finds that the
case, brought by seven present and past employees of Georgia
Power and the Southern Co., would be overwhelmed by the
individual claims of the proposed class of 2,400 African
American employees and that a class action was an
inefficient means for bringing the claims.

The suit, filed in July 2000, alleged a pattern and practice
of discrimination against African American employees with
respect to job opportunities--including opportunities for
advancement and promotion--as well as "reckless indifference
to a workplace environment that breeds racial animus." At
the core of the harassment complaints were charges that
nooses were a widespread fixture throughout the workplace. .

STARING ACTIONABLE UNDER CALIFORNIA SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAW,
COURT SAYS

An assembly line employee who said a co-worker stared at her
several times a day, sometimes for five to 10 minutes at a
time, after she complained to management about his unwelcome
sexual advances sufficiently stated a claim for sexual
harassment under California's Fair Employment and Housing
Act, the California Court of Appeal rules ("Birschtein v.
New United Motor Manufacturing Inc.,  "Cal. Ct. App.,  No.
A090680,  10/9/01).

Reversing summary judgment for New United Motor
Manufacturing Inc., the court says Michelle Birschtein can
take to the jury her claim that co-worker George Bonillia's
actions violated FEHA's ban on workplace sexual harassment.
In addition, the court rules that Birschtein presented a
triable issue as to whether her claims of sexual harassment
occurring outside FEHA's one-year statute of limitations
were part of a series of sexually harassing events that
created a continuing violation of the act.  Finally, the
court reinstates her retaliation claim, rejecting the
employer's argument that the claim failed because Birschtein
did not allege the employer took an adverse action against
her. . . . Page A-5
