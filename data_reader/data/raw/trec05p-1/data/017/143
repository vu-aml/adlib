Gerald,

Here is the information that you requested.

Counter party:  

Encore Acquisition Partners

Address:  

777 Main St., Ste. 1400
Fort Worth, TX 76102

Scope:  

The scope of this project is to analyze, develop and propose a compression services package that will optimally manage Encore's current and future horsepower requirements.  In order to do this we will need to explain our financial structures and gain access to information pertaining to their compression facilities and existing power agreements. 

Email me with the completed CA so that I can forward it on to the client.

Thanks

Nathan B. Creech
