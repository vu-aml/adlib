Hi Jeff.  I haven't heard from you since Christmas, but I do hear the 
gossip.  Steve said you were in New York this week.  Business or pleasure?  
And I guess you're working on your land quite a bit.

Hope everything is good.  Listen.  Wil and I want to go to see a Giants game 
next week.  I believe they are playing day games August 16,17 and 18th.  Is 
it posssible to get tickets from you?  If not, no problem, but Mom suggested 
I ask you if "your" Enron tickets were available.  I don't know if you have 
two or four tickets.  Two would be more than appreciated.  If you can get 
your hands on four, maybe I'll ask Deb and Micheal if they want to come.

This is all off the top of my head.  Let me know what you think.  Just 
thought I'd ask.

-Nancy
