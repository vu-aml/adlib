ILLINOIS HUMAN RIGHTS DEPARTMENT PROCEDURES RULED
UNCONSTITUTIONAL

Certain procedures used by the Illinois Department of Human
Rights to investigate employment discrimination complaints
violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois rules ("Cooper v. Salazar,
"N.D. Ill.,  No. 98-C-2930,  11/1/01).

Judge Shadur grants summary judgment to the plaintiffs, a
class of discrimination complainants led by Ricky Cooper, on
their due process claims against department director Carlos
J. Salazar. The court orders the department to stop relying
on witness credibility determinations made without affording
complainants an opportunity to confront and cross examine
witnesses against them.

The court also orders Salazar to allow complainants seeking
review of the department's decision not to pursue their
cases access to documents in their investigative files.
Finally, the court orders the department to modify certain
review procedures to protect the plaintiffs' due process
rights. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-54

SEVEN UNIONS, PIPELINE FIRM CHALLENGE OKLAHOMA'S
RIGHT-TO-WORK LAW

Seven unions and a pipeline services company file suit
seeking to overturn Oklahoma's newly adopted right-to-work
law, which prohibits union-security clauses in bargaining
contracts, bans union hiring halls, and requires individual
employee approval for union dues to be deducted from a
paycheck ("Local 514, Transport Workers Union v. Oklahoma,
"E.D. Okla., No. 01-633-S, "suit filed" 11/13/01). State
Question 695 was approved by 54 percent of the voters in a
special election Sept. 25.

The lawsuit filed in federal court in Oklahoma alleges that
SQ 695 violates the supremacy clause of the U.S.
Constitution and is preempted by the National Labor
Relations Act, the Railway Labor Act, the Postal
Reorganization Act, and the Civil Service Reform Act. The
challengers also allege SQ 695 violates the Oklahoma
Constitution's amendment procedures and constitutes a
prohibited "special law" not applying to any other types of
membership organizations. The suit asks the court to declare
the constitutional amendment invalid and to permanently
enjoin state officials from enforcing it. . . . Page A-2

EEOC WILL STILL INVESTIGATE ADA CHARGES AFTER "GARRETT"

The EEOC is advising its district directors to continue
processing and investigating disability discrimination
charges against state government employers, despite the U.S.
Supreme Court's ruling that individuals can no longer sue
those employers for monetary relief under the Americans with
Disabilities Act.

Such individual suits were barred by the U.S. Supreme
Court's February decision in "Board of Trustees of the
University of Alabama v. Garrett. " However, the EEOC memo
advises that the agency will continue to investigate these
charges and refer them for mediation and continue to
coordinate charges that have "litigation potential" with the
Department of Justice.

The commission observes that the "severe limitations" placed
on private lawsuits by the "Garrett " ruling makes its own
enforcement role "more important than ever." But a former
general counsel sees the directive as "wishful thinking" on
the part of the civil rights enforcement agency. . . . Page

BUSH SIGNS AIRPORT SECURITY BILL TO FEDERALIZE SCREENERS

President Bush signs into law a bill (S. 1447, Conf. Rep.
107-296) that will place all responsibility for airport
security into the hands of the federal government and
federalize virtually all airport baggage screeners within
one year. Organized labor's reaction to the measure has been
largely positive, but unions that represent federal workers
are questioning the status of baggage screeners after they
become federal employees.

The measure calls for a new undersecretary of transportation
for security who will "be responsible for hiring and
training personnel to provide security screening at all
airports in the United States." The American Federation of
Government Employees says it is "alarmed and disappointed"
that the report does not ensure federal employee screeners
have the same rights as other employees.

Meanwhile, flight attendants' and pilots' unions applaud the
bill's passage, noting that it contains many features that
have long been priorities in their organizations. Of
particular importance to the Association of Flight
Attendants was a provision that requires screening of all
checked bags. . . . Page A-9,  Text E-1

SIXTH CIRCUIT REJECTS RETALIATORY FIRING CLAIM IN FAMILY
LEAVE SUIT

The Sixth Circuit rejects a retaliatory discharge claim
filed by an employee who claimed Great Lakes Power Service
Co. fired him  "in retaliation for "intending" to take his
statutorily protected 12 weeks of leave" ("Skrjanc v. Great
Lakes Power Serv. Co., " 6th Cir., No. 00-3726,  11/14/01).
"The right to actually take 12 weeks of leave pursuant to
the FMLA includes the right to declare an intention to take
such leave in the future," the court says. It finds Michael
Skrjanc, however, failed to show that because he invoked his
FMLA rights, he was treated differently than similarly
situated employees.

 Skrjanc was discharged at the same time the company was
divesting itself of its pump unit, where he worked. The
three other people who also worked in the pump unit were
fired as well, the court points out. All four of the pump
unit employees were fired, none was considered for a new
position, and Skrjanc failed to show that Great Lakes had a
history of considering employees for transfer when their
positions were eliminated, the court says. . . . Page A-1
