The exact location is Lakewood LMP.  There is a substation at Lakewood.  Plant location is 55 miles south of New York City on an exit ramp of the Garden State Parkway.  To my knowledge, the existing plant is not interconnected to NY.  In any event, pricing would be for PJM East.

What is the exact location (in terms of LMP) - is this a PJM east or PJM west hub ? Is it connected to NY, either Zone G or Zone J ?

Brandon and Harry:

Brandon:  I assume the pricing is at the mids.  Also, since the spread between the 1.50VOM and the 3.00VOM is so small, I'll just quote the 1.50.

Harry:  Please look at the entire email thread (to get a sense of all the metrics we're employing for this quote).  ConEd has already announced a 3x7FA peaker configuration for Lakewood, NJ.  The site is already owned by ConEd, part of an existing 230MW combined cycle plant they already own.  It's on the same transmission line (running to the south) as the Oyster Creek nuclear facility, which has a license expiration in 2009.  The existing plant is a non-merchant EWG, selling 215MW to JCP&L pusuant to a twenty-year PPA expiring in 2014.  ConEd has put out an RFP to sell 200-250MW of the peaking capacity from this planned facility.  They planned to have the unit operational by June 2002.  If we provide this synthetic toll, the plant construction would be deferred.  Let me know if we can do 350 to 500MW and let's talk about appropriate spreads above the mids.  Also, please be mindful of their desire for 8 hour mins.

Thanks

Pricing as follows:
For the 3 year option:
$1.50 VOM - $1.77
$3.00 VOM - $1.69

For the 4 year option:
$1.50 VOM - $1.74
$3.00 VOM - $1.66

As always, these prices are indicative.  For a product of that size (350-500MW), I would probe the customer to find a break-even/cost of construction price, and approach Harry to get the risk premium.
Let me know how it works out,
