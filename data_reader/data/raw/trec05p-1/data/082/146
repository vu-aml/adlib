Thanks.  That would be great.  Do you think it can be this week because we are trying to get a presentation ready for Mr. Lay.

Mary/Michelle, 
Would it be possible for us to meet today to discuss the HR data needed to to run the standard deviations.  All other data has been prepared to submit to Jeanerette. 

Thanks.

Mary, 
We are currently in the process of doing diversity analysis with the Mid-Year 2001 PRC data.  We will also have the Jeanerette group run the standard deviations.  Since I have taken on the EEO/AAP responsibility, Michelle and I agree that the HR data needs to be incorporated into the analysis and will need your approval for me to get access to the information.   Please let me know what I need to do to get clearance.  Our target is to get the information ready by Thursday but will need at least a day to consolidate the information.    

Thanks. ay
