Shelley:

  Yes, we can!!  My Bible Study starts at 5pm. I have an hour!  We may change 
the Bible Study to an earlier time though due to the Super Bowl and then I 
will have more than an hour. Either way...I know I will be there.  Please 
know I am praying for you for strength and perseverance as you contine to be 
with Enron. I am sure things are not really comfortable right now but I sure 
am glad they have a wonderful light of Christ's witness like you to be among 
all the darkness.  My heart is still mourning the gentleman who ended his 
life. I pray there will be no one else. Alina grows in leaps and bounds each 
day. I see her at ACEC and she is pure delight. She yells a greeting to me 
when she sees me and it lights up my heart.  I am not sure what she is saying 
but we know each other and it really thrills me to see her smile and her 
little hand waving.  She is such a blessing!  Everyone shows her so much 
love. At Sunday school last week we all really gave Chad encouragment and 
affirmation that he is now the big brother.  He seemed pleased and a wee bit 
shy about all the attention.  Hope and pray we were not toooo much for him.  
Shelly, if you ever get stuck for someone to keep the kids for a while...I 
would be honored if my schedule permits.  Just wanted you to know! 
Thanks for all you do and are doing! I can't wait to begin beating the drum 
for VBS.
In Him,
Patty
