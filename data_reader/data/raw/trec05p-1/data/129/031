The documents give us a choice between paying the Remaining Purchase Amount Refund Amount ($5.099 million) to the LLC or paying the GE Accelerated Payment ($?) to GE.  As you know cash is extremely tight at the moment - have we done all we can to negotiate a lower payoff amount with GE?  The Remaining Purchase Amount Refund Amount allows us to deduct interest, a benefit of ~2.24%.  Can GE give us any discount in excess of 2.24%?  If so, we should opt for the GE Accelerated Payment.  We can discuss this further tomorrow.

Mike Young from NW called to advise me that they received GE's consent. NW plans to send us notice of this tomorrow. I believe this will trigger our obligation to pay NW the balance of payments we hold, discounted at 7.5 % p.a. I believe this means that we will need to pay NW $5.1 million of the $5.2 million we have been prepaid.

Let's talk about this in the AM.
