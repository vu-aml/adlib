Lewis' four-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or rehabilitate!

Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back.

He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1436&key=1094&"><B>Emmitt Smith</B></A>, RB DAL - Rocks <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice !
th!
at Smith would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1436&key=1184&"><B>Frank Sanders</B></A>, WR ARI - Baja <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1436&key=235174&"><B>Chris Weinke</B></A>, QB CAR - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>
Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1436&key=133263&"><B>Daunte Culpepper</B></A>, QB MIN - Hunter Shively <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1436&key=1248&"><B>Cris Carter</B></A>, WR MIN - Matt Lenhart <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16!

1</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1436&key=12576&"><B>Randy Moss</B></A>, WR MIN - Hunter Shively <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1436&key=133448&"><B>Ricky Williams</B></A>
, RB NO - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.   </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1436&key=133233&"><B>Aaron Brooks</B></A>, QB NO - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=14!

He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1436&key=1440&"><B>Stephen Davis</B></A>, RB WAS - Matt Lenhart <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1436&key=1310&"><B>Michael Westbrook</B></A>, WR WAS - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games.

He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1436&key=12411&"><B>Az-Zahir Hakim</B></A>, WR STL - FIBSABs <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right.

Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1436&key=1456&"><B>Richard Huntley</B></A>, RB CAR - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings.

Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1436&key=1028&"><B>Brett Favre</B></A>, QB GB - The Klap <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season.

 his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player.
