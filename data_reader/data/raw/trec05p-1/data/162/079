VIRAL GENETICS, INC.

	December, 2001
HIGHLIGHTS

*	Viral Genetics has developed a revolutionary new technology called TNP which, based on clinical results to date, not only 
stops but also reverses the progression of HIV infection in people.
*	TNP is an extracted, naturally occurring, biologically active linear protein which, when purified and modified, greatly 
stimulates the body's immune response system.
*	Three months after an eight week TNP treatment, 8 out of 10 terminally ill AIDS patients in clinical trials show virtually no 
sign of HIV infection.
*	TNP treated patients display virtually no side effects to treatment.
*	TNP technology is patented in 16 countries and patent pending in Canada and the U.S.
*	Treatments are far less costly and less cumbersome than currently employed alternatives.

OVERVIEW

Viral Genetics, Inc. was founded in 1995 to develop and commercialize therapeutic and diagnostic systems for the treatment of 
viral diseases.  Their primary focus has been on finding a treatment which would stop and reverse the progression of HIV 
infection in humans.  After expenditures in excess of $8M, Viral Genetics developed their core technology - TNP (Thymus 
Nuclear Protein).

Since TNP's discovery, Viral Genetics has conducted numerous animal studies and three human clinical trials.  Each human trial 
consisted of 10 to 20 patients in the late stages of infection.  TNP was administered by intra-muscular injection bi-weekly over 
an eight week period.  Follow up was carried out on all the patients anywhere from 50 to 667 days after treatment.  The trials 
revealed the following incredible results with respect to TNP's efficacy and safety:

-	HIV viral levels were reduced by 90% even 18 months after treatment.
-	Patients experienced minimal side effects during treatment which completely subsided after treatment and remained that way 
even 18 months after treatment.
-	Dramatic reductions occurred even with HIV resistant strains that no Antiviral Drug Cocktail has shown any efficacy with 
whatsoever.
-	Most patients started to regain body weight during and after TNP treatment.

Viral Genetics is in discussions with a number of world wide governments to commercialize the TNP technology.
