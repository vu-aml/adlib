As you all know, I participated in the advisory committee that helped draft the "draft" MA RPS regs.   Our group finished the process about a year ago.  Since that time, the DOER has been working with the Gov's office on the language.  National Grid has caused some "stink" over the last month regarding their obligation to comply.  I've not yet had a chance to review the attached draft, but hopefully it did not stray too far from the original draft.  I'll give you comments and impact by the end of the week.  The MA RPS will go into effect in 2003.
