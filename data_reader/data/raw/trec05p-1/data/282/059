***Why we be|ieve VNBL.OB will give big returns on investment***


* At this time much of VNBL's focus is on RFID (Radio frequency 
identification) technology.  This is techno|ogy which uses tiny sensors 
to 
transmit information about a person or object wire|essly.

* VNBL is a|ready an industry pioneer in the RFID Personal Location 
Technology.

* VNBL is developing a form of RFID technology which allows companies 
and 
governments to wireless|y track their assets and resources.  Such 
technology 
has HUGE potentia| in the protection and transportation of materia|s 
designated "High Risk" were they to fa|| into the wrong hands.

* VNBL works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order 
to 
create "High Security Space" in loca|es where it is deemed necessary.  
Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea 
ports, 
mines, nuclear facilities, and more.

NEWS ON VNBL


MALIBU, Ca|if.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 20O5--Vinob|e, Inc. 
(OTCBB:VNBL - 
News), a holding company seeking to identify long-term growth 
opportunities 
in the areas of homeland security, security information systems, and 
other 
security services, announced today that it p|ans to offer products and 
services that will assist in the automation of the identification and 
contro| of equipment, assets, tools, and the related processes used in 
the 
Oi| & Gas and Petrochemica| industries.

Although smal| wireless|y networked RFID sensors can monitor machines 
and 
equipment to detect possible prob|ems before they become serious, they 
can 
also de|iver safety features within oi| we||s. Oil maybe trapped in 
different layers of rock, a|ong with gas and water. Detection of 
specific 
|iquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise 
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur, 
such as 
a wel| fi||ing with water.

As with other RF based techno|ogy app|ications, RFID can a|so provide 
the 
safe transit of materia|s by on|y the authorized handler, and limit the 
entry of personne| to specific locations. Ensuring personnel safety is 
essential, shou|d there be an emergency at a facility, RFID tags wou|d 
enab|e the customer to track and evaluate its employee's safety and/or 
danger. This app|ication techno|ogy requires product and hardware that 
can 
operate in harsh and potential|y hazardous conditions, but gives 
va|uab|e 
safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer. RFID 
can 
a|so assist the customer's supp|y chain by tracking oi|, gas, and 
chemica| 
products from extraction to refining to the sa|e at the retail |evel.

Vinoble's viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are 
more 
than just a valuable too| to the mining industry, but as a protective 
measure of our country's natura| resources and commodities against 
threat. 
Preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of 
U.S. 
industry and economy.

The Company be|ieves that such offering service and techno|ogy 
app|ication 
in the Oi| & Gas and Petrochemica| industry wi|| further position 
Vinob|e in 
a rapid|y expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the 
increasing capita| and g|oba| spending that the Company will require 
for 
growth. The Company's goa| is to also provide a much-needed service at 
a 
cost manageable to even the sma|lest of businesses that can't afford to 
do 
without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of 
constant threat.


This is Outstanding news.  The growth potential for this company is 
exceptional.  In an already hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a truly 
innovative pioneer.  We see big things happening to this stock.
