Michelle/Lizsette;

I was wondering if circumstances with Jonathan Lane (the contract Help desk person whom I mentioned to you a week or so ago) have been resolved?  When we last spoke I mentioned that he went to Valeria Hope's group.  I am not sure of the outcome  of that visit, but I will tell  you that his negative attitude and general dissatisfaction on the team is becoming disruptive to the other help desk members. He is away from his desk often (having "meetings", which may be interviews for other positions), he has shared with the other team members his perceptions of management and his issues with us.  

If and when I can do so, I would like to terminate him.  I won't until I hear from you all, and we are documenting discussions as you requested.  I hope this can end soon, though because this is causing real problems here.
