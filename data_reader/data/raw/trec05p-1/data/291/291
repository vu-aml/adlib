I just received notice from COR that they do "not intend to schedule or pay for any further energy deliveries" by Enron. The notice is dated May 30. Please let me know the instant Riverside refuses our energy delivery schedule. Since we have purchased the entire month of June, we will be in a position of liquidating that length should Riverside refuse delivery. Once Riverside refuses delivery,  we should plan on attempting to schedule at least once again to demonstrate their intent to continue to refuse delivery. Therefore, we need to discuss strategy before selling Riverside length back into the market or, alternatively, booking out with the energy supplier. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Ed
