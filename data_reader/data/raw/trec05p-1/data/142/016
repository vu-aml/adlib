This DASH definitely needs a Legal Risk memo, which I have attached as a separate document.  Along with the DASH, it needs to be updated for the actual sale price (and the date was wrong--I fixed that on the attached but be sure Gerald's version has the right date) and then added on to the body of the DASH before signatures.  Gorte has already looked at this one, so we should be okay to get going on the signatures right away, though I would still start with him, just in case.  

There must be a computer glitch (!!!), because I am not able to open the Act of Sale and Board Resolution documents that Gerald forwarded.  He will, of course, provide executable copies of those documents anyway (same goes for the TB documents), but I will forward you his email and hopefully you will have better luck opening them than I did. The DASH anf the Lega Risk Memo are attached below, and I will leave copies of the Certificate of Non-Foreign Status on your desk.
