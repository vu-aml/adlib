Hello,
I hope you will not receive this proposal too surprising. I
got your 
contact E-mail address in the Internet while searching for
a 
trustworthy business partner who I can entrust a reasoning
amount of 
money on his or her care for investment.
I am a Liberian and a cabinet member of President Charles
Taylor's 
administration. I am presently in the republic of (Sao Tome)  under 

polical asylum status because of the on going war in
Liberia. For your 
information I have secured and sent abroad the sum of
$12,000,000.00 
(TWELVE MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLAR) through a diplomatic
means. The 
fund is presently under the custody in a Finance/storage
company in 
oversea. The money was originally meant for the purchase of
arms and 
ammunition to fight the rebel groups in Liberia but from
the look of 
things it is like we cannot continue with the war because
of the 
intervention of President George Bush of America .As a
result of the 
present development I now send the money abroad for my
personal 
investment without the knowledge of our Government.
My main purpose of writing you is to seek your partnership
if you could 
make claim of the money from the storage company as the
beneficiary for 
the benefit of both us. I am willing to discuss sharing
ratio in any 
reliable business you would embark.
Details of how you are going to claim the money from the
storage 
company will be made known to you as soon as you indicate
your interest 
in this transaction.
Do send me the following details.
Full Names,contact address
telephone and fax numbers.
Please treat this proposal with utmost confidenciality.
Wait to hear from you. 
Best regards,
Johnson Oloshe
