   Word of the Day for Thursday April 4, 2002:

   taciturn \TAS-uh-turn\, adjective:
   Habitually silent; not inclined to talk.

     On stage she seemed to become transformed, and the contrast
     was even more noticeable given her shy, taciturn character,
     shrouded  in  the  impalpable  veil  of  gloom  that always
     surrounded her.
     --Pino Cacucci, Tina Modotti: A Life

     A  balding,  stocky, taciturn man who wore glasses, he gave
     an impression of distance and seriousness.
     --"Diana's  Driver:  Unsettling  Piece in a Puzzle," [1]New
     York Times, September 21, 1997

     In  the  company  of  even his close literary and political
     friends he was shy if not taciturn.
     --"Passionate voice of the press," [2]Irish Times, November
     4, 1997
     _________________________________________________________

   Taciturn  comes  from  Latin  taciturnus,  from tacere, "to be
   silent."
