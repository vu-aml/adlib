Please read below attachment.  From what some of you have told me, we are way ahead of the game!

I registered everyone to walk this morning who did not tell me they won't be able to make it.  Frankly, my plan is to only walk about a mile, then to go home and start mixing the mimosas (and perhaps drinking one, too!)

Let's hope the weather is as nice as it's been this past week!
