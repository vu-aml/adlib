Stephanie - as we discussed - go ahead and set up the back office users in the new production data base.
Please just remind them that this is production - and not a test environment.  

Some authorized users are testing certain elements of the data base - but they are responsible for making sure the test data is cleaned up.

Tom,

Everyone in risk management needs to get access to EOL bridge monitor and reports.  What do we need to do to get this and how soon can it be granted?  We need this by Thursday to be prepared for testing.

Thanks

Kam
