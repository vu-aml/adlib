Dear Friends,
Since the Excite @home network went down on Saturday morning, all emailed correspondence directed to AvramSiegel @ home.com or AllisonFisher @home.com or TrueBluegrass @home.com has been lost, and will not be recovered.  Please do not attempt to 'reply' to any previous emails sent from us individually or the True Blue bluegrass Band, because those emails now have an invalid reply address. If you have saved a previous email from True Blue, please delete it and save this one instead.  The Excite network has been replaced with the AT&T network, and email addresses have changed from @home.com to AvramSiegel@attbi.com.  If you wish to get in touch with True Blue, you can "reply" to this email, or contact any of the bandmembers via our website at www.truebluegrass.com.  There you may send safely send email to trueblue@truebluegrass.com. We are very sorry for the inconvenience.  This abrupt termination of service has seriously jeopardized our bookings for the coming year, so we appreciate your help in making this correction.  Thank you for your understanding, and we hope to hear from you at our new address!
Regards,
Avram, Allison and True Blue
