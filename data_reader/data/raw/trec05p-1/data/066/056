Kelly:  Please send the paperwork to me.  I will also need to review the site and legal works through an internal Networks person (for consistency purposes).  Please forward contact information to me (name, phone, email, etc.).  Thanks.

Laurel and Sara.  UBS has an Internet Module that they are going to start using for "Verbal Confims" on FX trades.  You can see a little of what it contains, but they have informed me that we have to be set up with ID's and passwords, sign a contract etc.  The contact at UBS is Max Squire and he will provide me with more info when needed.  Max has explained to me that as the trades are entered into the system we will go in and mark confirmed when we agree.  It sounds very interesting to me.  Let me know what you think.  I can ask Max to send me the paperwork for your review.

Thank you.
