I chatted with Jim - everything's cool. Call me when you need me. 

One question (Sally mentioned it) - is Bob Hall 'in'? She saw a list that had him in and excluded myself - is that an old list - hopefully....?

If I'm a first reserve for Bob or am I incremental? Just keep me posted. I won't be offended.
