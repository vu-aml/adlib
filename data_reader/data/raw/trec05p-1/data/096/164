Ken,

Thanks for putting the issues in perspective for all of us - i.e., it is not the lack of adversity, but rather one's response to adversity, that makes one great and builds one's character.  From what you said, it sounds like Enron has faced (with integrity) some serious adversity in the past and rallied admirably - certainly no reason to think the same will not happen this tough time.  Keep steering the boat - we'll all get through this!!  

Thanks and God Bless You!
