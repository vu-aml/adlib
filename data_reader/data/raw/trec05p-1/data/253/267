Neartown neighbors,

This Saturday morning, march 23rd, is Opening Game day for the Neartown Little League at Dunlavy Park. (Dunlavy at the SW Freeway)

The morning begins with a parade on Firetrucks at 8:30am from Fiesta's parking lot (W. Alabama & Dunlavy) south on Dunlavy to the Park.

At the park the Opening game ceremony will include City Council members, national Little league officials and the news media.

The NLL continues to grow (now at 121 kids), with a new batting cage in a refurbished ball field as part of a long term program for community kids.

II you have kids and have been thinking about little league, its a good opportunity to see this program in action.

With or without kids, it's a fun way to spend an hour or so watching what your neighbors have worked hard to provide all kids in the neighborhoods of our communities.

For questions or information...(never too late to sign your kids up...), call me.

Thanks
