Hi Rod!  Kevin has requested that I book some time on your calendar.  I realize that Kathy is out and no one else seems to have access to your calendar.  I talked to Pam but she can't view it.  Here are the time allotments needed:

1 hour - Kevin Howard/Davis Thames (topic: unknown) - Monday

1 hour - Kevin Howard/Jeff McMahon (topic: EGS financing activities)

Please let me know what you time slots you have available on Monday for these meetings so I may confirm.
