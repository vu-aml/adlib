David -

Tana expressed concern last night that Sally Beck's world doesn't seem to have much direction and with Bob Hall deciding not to go to NETCO, there is a lot of talk/speculation about why he is not going.

Just wanted to bring this to your attention - Lavo asked that we add Sally back on the NETCO list, but then said for us not to tell her.  I think with Bob's departure, we need to identify and communicate who the lead is so that the team can be given direction and get things back on track.  

Let me know your thoughts - any help that you can give would be greatly appreciated.

Amy
