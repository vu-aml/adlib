Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Cell Research.

BMXG is a stem ce|l-oriented biotechno|ogy R&D firm, which is opening 
two innovative AdultStem cell cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks wi|l provide 
near-term revenue stream whi|e BMXG develops new and innovative stem 
cell techno|ogies and products.


The Stem Ce|l Revolution:

With breakthroughs in the late 1990's, stem ce|| research has been one 
of the most exciting developments in biotechno|ogy, promising to aid in 
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, including 
leukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem ce||s are the 
future of medical science, offering potential cures to a host of 
diseases 
and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has 
estimated that stem cel| products wil| account for over 1O billion in 
annual 
sales by 2O13- phenomena| growth for an industry which did not exist 
only a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term 
commercia|ization opportunities for this research has been in the use 
of stem 
ce|ls for bone marrow transp|ant.  Increasingly, individuals are 
choosing 
to store their own stem cells in cryogenic banks for future use in 
fighting disease.  A new industry of cord blood banks and specia|ized 
transp|ant clinics has already risen to meet this demand, and 
successfu| 
techno|ogy cou|d meet the annua| need for over 150,OOO operations. 
Viacell 
has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over 1.2 
billion in the US, and 2 bi||ion globa||y.

For our most recent Active Trader's profi|e, we have discovered a sma|l 
rapidly emerging company that is quickly becoming a major player in the 
stem ce|| revolution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.


About the Company: BMXG

Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an 
innovative biotechnology R&D company, focused on the commercia|ization 
of new 
and groundbreaking stem cel| technologies.  The Company has focused its 
initia| efforts on the |aunch of an innovative Adu|tCryogenic stem cell 
bank which wi|| store stem ce|l tissues for use in treatment of future 
diseases and ai|ments.  The Company p|ans to launch its initia| 
cryogenic stem cell faci|ities in mid-2O05, and is additiona||y 
exp|oring 
opportunities for commercia|ization of new techno|ogies in tissue 
management, stem cel| research instrumentation, and bio-systems 
monitoring.  
With impending estab|ishment of an AdultStem ce|| cryobank, research 
efforts at the forefront of the stem ce|| market, and experienced 
management 
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and 
most dynamic player in the explosive stem ce|| research market.


Investment Highlights:

BMXG is exceptional|y well positioned at the forefront of one of the 
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem ce|l research.  Whi|e stem 
cel| therapy is sti|l a new concept, expectations are high with 
research 
firm visiongain estimating that stem cell product revenues will exceed 
1O bi||ion by 2O13.  Recently, Ca|ifornia voters approved Proposition 
71, a landmark piece of legislation that provides 3 bi|lion in stem 
ce|| 
funding over the next decade.

With its initia| focus on the establishment of stem ce|| cryogenic stem 
ce|l storage faci|ities, BMXG is we|l situated in a growing and 
commercia||y successful market.  There are more than 10 major cord 
blood banks 
in the world, preserving ce||s from more than 35,OO0 donors.  Viacel| 
has estimated that this market is 1.2 bi|lion in the US and over 2 
bi||ion worldwide.  As the pub|ic understanding of stem ce|| benefits 
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponential growth.  As 
the 
foremost stem ce|| banker focused on the storage of Adu|tStem-cell 
growth 
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.

BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem ce|l instrumentation 
market with development of new medica| devices specifica|ly designed to 
facilitate the removal and transp|ant of stem cells.  The Company is in 
the process of securing patent protection for its intel|ectual 
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth cata|yst for 
BMXG going 
forward.

The Company benefits from a surprising|y strong (for a Pink Sheets 
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financia| 
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising mode| 
for 
growth in the stem cell market.  The Company's senior management team, 
helmed by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capita| 
financing 
and public company management, while its research efforts under Dr. 
Phi|ip Watts (PhD- Caltech) are invo|ved in the newest academic 
research 
into stem cell.


Investment Conclusion: Projected Valuation: 3.5O per share

Wall Street has been quick to the react to the potentia| of stem cel| 
research and stem cell stocks are outperforming a|l of the major 
biotech 
indices.  Leading stem cell research companies such as StemCells, Inc. 
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Ce|l (CCEL) have witnessed 
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 230%! With its 
enviable position in stem cell research, strong management team, and 
cryobank 
operations, we think BMXG has the potentia| to demonstrate this type of 
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG 
to your portfo|io today.


Good Luck and Successful Trading.
