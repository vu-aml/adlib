With due respect, I am Mrs MARY OKEREKE, Having gone
through your profile, Iam convinced and pleased to contact
you for some assistance and business relationship.I am a
widow, who live in NIGERIA. I have a daughter who is the
joy of my life. My late husband was a loving, caring and
hardworking businessman who diedunfortunately in an auto
crash. Before the sudden death of my beloved husband and
father of my daughter, my late husband intended to
establish a business in the united states of America with
the sum of $5million united states dollars,but
unfortunately he died before this proposed venture.
Following his death, his family members are telling me that
I am not entitled to his property (Assets and fund) because
i am a woman and my offspring is a female as well
,according to some barbaric traditional laws here in
Nigeria (Africa) which doesn't permit a woman to inherit a
man's property, but I and my child will be cratered for by
the late husband family will take over the management of
his business and other properties. Unfortunately to this
wicked family members, the $5 million united states dollars
which my late husband intended to use in establishing a
business in the United States. This fund was deposited in a
bank account unknown to his family .It is me and the
Manager of the bank is aware of this fund, so I have
discussed this matter with the Manager that I want this
fund personally and he agreed based on some compensation.
According to the Manager, the best way to secure this fund
is to transfer it to a foreign account outside Nigeria for
safe-keeping, later it will be used for business
establishment with your advice and assistance, which I will
also come over to your country. At this juncture, I and the
Manager needs your sincere assistance in providing us with
your bank account, so that this fund can be transferred
into it within (14)working days as soon as I hear your
positive response,However, I and the Manager has agreed to
give you 25% of the fund as a reward for your sincere
assistance and the remaining 75% of the fund will be for
us(I and the Manager). Thanks you and God Bless, 

Mary Okereke
PLEASE REPLY ME BACK ON MY MANAGER'S EMAIL
