Staff thought that if the 20 kw stays and the easements go, they can
probably get the votes in the Assembly.  The Senate could have problems with
the easements and RPS since both are near and dear to them.  If Angelides
bought off on the DA, they could probably live with it.  We need to look
into the 20 kw further.

I've got to re-look at them, but as I recall, they are bad, but bad is
better than nothing.  What's your view as to the likelihood that 1)
something actually gets out of the Assembly, and 2) something gets from
the Assembly through the Senate.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

What do you think about the final DA provisions in ABX2 82?
