Stacey,

Harlan Murphy informed me that City of Redding has not terminated.  I asked him to have Stephanie Panus take it off of the master list as a "Y".  I called Steve Hall and Steve had Harlan call me with the answer to City of Redding.

Let me know if you need me to help with anything else.

Thanks,
Melissa

I have not recompared the Master Log to the 'Physical Terminated' spreadsheet.  This is just an update of my initial review.  Any comments would be appreciated.  I have also not included the Auto Terminations that we found out about today.  After tomorrow's updates, I will do these.  We are planning on moving the auto-terminations identified by David and confirmed by Kimberly to the bankruptcy book tomorrow.  If anyone has a problem with the counterparties identified, please let me know as soon as possible

Thanks,

Stacey
