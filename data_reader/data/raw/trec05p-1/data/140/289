I'm sorry that your hot tub is lonely, but I think it needs to adjust it's chlorine and bromine levels!  My skin was like sandpaper the next day!   I'd love to tell you all about my trip.  If you'd like, I'll give you a call tonight if we go out.  Let me know.

    Hi Paul, how are you?  I'm back.  Had an incredible time.  We didn't make it to Tahoe until the last night so I didn't call.  Hope all is well with you.  How are things with Enron?  Were you guys aquired?  Planning a happy hour tonight.  What's your plan?

    Lisa
