 Here are the details of the CNR restructuring that is happening effective Dec 1/01.  This should reduce the amount of credit Enron has been asked to post with both PGT-NW and TCPL.

EC purch from CNR of 15,000 mmbtu term Dec 01-Oct08:

EC sale to ENA of 15,000 mmbtu term Dec 01- Oct 08:

EC and ENA own renewal rights. CNRL does not.
