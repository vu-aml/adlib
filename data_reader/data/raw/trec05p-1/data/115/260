Centralized Control, Distributed Processing

A 170 Systems and KPMG Consulting live Webcast
Thursday, November 15, 2001, 1:00 PM EST 


Join us to learn how the introduction of distributed processing in your shared 
service center can optimize business operations by increasing productivity and 
efficiency while eliminating unnecessary costs.

The presentation will examine the benefits and common pitfalls of today's 
classic shared service center, and more importantly, how this model is rapidly 
evolving.  We will share key concepts and best practices based upon experiences 
with global clients, and we will outline the leading-edge vision in shared 
service delivery including:

-   Reducing costs and identifying key ROI drivers in the optimized model - 
    focusing on productivity and efficiency.
-   Achieving a higher level of functional control, improving access, speed, 
    efficiency, and productivity, by balancing centralized and distributed 
    processing.
-   Utilizing key location and function-specific knowledge by deploying 
    self-service applications for employees and strategic partners.
-   Leveraging the investment made in your existing financial systems - how the 
    fusion of efficient business process design and automation technology can 
    pay big dividends.
