Sally and Greg - if you are available, will you please plan to attend this meeting as observers also?  I will be sending another e-mail with more details.  Jeff McMahon suggested to Ken Lay that it would be good for you both to attend to be able to be updated on all that's going on.

Thanks.

Rosie
