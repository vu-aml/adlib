Joe said he found me in the morning face down on the couch in my clothes with the cat snuggling up with me.

that's amazing....i hit his door at least 10 times w/ Murphy's toy....i'm guessing he'd had a few cocktails too....

btw...shame on your for trying to get me to go in there as a joke....i almost did, until i remembered i'm not in college anymore and this guy works at my company...course that all came to me in a flash as i was turning the door knob.

you were doing a little nodding off yourself....that couch was a trap

get this......he didn't even wake up!  He had no idea that you were there and couldn't figure out how Murphy got out of his room.
