Dan,
We will have pipeline repairs to do on the mainline in sections 7 & 8,  between Stations 6 and 8.  PII is running a LAPA program on the smart pig results from the pigs ran last September.  Once the LAPA results are complete, probably within the next 2 weeks, Earl Chanley will put together a scope and estimate of work.  We don't have a date for the work yet, but probably will be in the May/June time frame.  These smart pig runs are a part of Transwestern's Risk Management Demo Project with OPS.  We will probably have to take the mainline to 60% MAOP for repairs, so there is a possibility for flow restrictions.  
We also have budgeted to smart pig the Crawford Lateral this year.  Regulating flow for the proper pig speed may cause flow restrictions.  We don't have a date for this pig run yet.  I'll work with Jeff, Max Brown, Darrell Schoolcraft, and Earl Chanley to schedule this and the pipeline repairs in section 7 & 8.
Thanks,  Arnie
