NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 11/29/01
Johnson suffered a slight ankle injury during Monday night's win over St. Louis. However, he is expected to start in Sunday against Cincinnati, so don't be afraid to play him this week. 

Terrell Owens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 11/29/01
According to the Contra Costa Times, Owens (ankle/foot) could miss Sunday's game against Buffalo. He missed pratice on Wednesday and could miss practice on Thursday as well. "We've got ! si! x games left and I know what's at stake for this team", said Owens. I've got to be smart about it (the injury)." He is currently listed as questionable for Week 12, which could make him a risky start for Fantasy owners. 

Saints <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=18&>, DT NO - JWillie Updated 11/29/01
Cornerback Kevin Mathis missed practice on Wednesday due to a neck injury. "I've been trying to play through it, but I think it has caught up with me," Mathis told the Times-Picayune. "I start out the game fine, but after about the second tackle, the pain comes back immediately." Mathis is questionable for Sunday's game against Carolina, which could be good news for Fantasy owners with Panther receivers on their roster. 

Cameron Cleeland <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=12277&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Cleeland, who has been nursing a high ankle sprain for several weeks, returned to practice on Wednesday. "He looked good out there running and catching the ball, but we'll see," coach Jim Haslett told the Times-Picayune. Cleeland has been upgraded from doubtful to questionable for Week 12, but he's still too risky to start on your Fantasy team unless you're extremely desperate. 

Jackie Harris <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Harris, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, practiced on W! ed! nesday. The team expects him to play on Sunday against Washington, but he's not reliable enough for Fantasy owners to consider starting in Week 12. 

Kris Mangum <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1672&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Mangum suffered a neck stinger during practice on Wednesday. His status for Sunday's game against New Orleans is uncertain. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/29/01
According to the Charlotte Observer , Muhammad is expected to miss this weekend's game against New Orleans due to a shoulder injury. Isaac Byrd will make his second consecutive start in Muhammad's absence. 

Maurice Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 11/29/01
Smith is dealing with both neck and ankle injuries, but he was able to practice on Wednesday. He has been losing carries to Bob Christian in recent weeks, however, and playing against a tough Rams' defense doesn't bode well for his chances for Fantasy success. 

Falcons <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=2&>, DT ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Cornerback Ray Bu! ch! anan missed practice on Wednesday due to flu-like symptoms. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against St. Louis, but his absence won't make Atlanta's defense any less attractive against the Rams' top-notch offense. 

Thomas Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=187390&>, RB ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/29/01
Jones is dealing with an upper-respitory infection that caused him to miss practice on Wednesday. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game at Oakland, but he won't see enough carries to warrant a start on your Fantasy team.

Frank Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Sanders missed practice on Wednesday due to soreness in both of his hamstrings. He is currently listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Oakland, so be sure to monitor his status if you need to start him in Week 12. 

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/29/01
Smith told the Denver Post he expects to play Sunday at Miami, but he won't be able to attempt to practice until at least Friday. Even if he does play, he won't be at full strength, and he may be limited.

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/29/01
Davis said his! k! nee felt good in practice on Wednesday, and he will start on Sunday at Miami, says the Denver Post. Still, it is not clear how much he will play, and Davis will probably share carries with Mike Anderson.

Freddie Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1843&>, TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 11/29/01
Jones did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game as he continues to battle a nagging ankle injury.

Jeff Graham <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Graham missed Wednesday's practice with a thigh bruise, and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game. Trevor Gaylor may have to start against the Seahawks if Graham cannot play.

Steve Christie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1378&>, K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Christie was signed by the Chargers, and will replace Wade Richey as the team's placekicker. Richey will continue to work on kickoffs. Christie appears to be recovered from a groin injury that led to his release in Buffalo earlier this year. See how he performs in his first game or two before considering him for Fantasy purposes. 

Roland Williams <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=12829&>, TE OAK - Free Agent ! Updated 11/29/01
Williams has missed practice time with an ankle injury, and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game with Arizona. Mondriel Fulcher will probably start in his place if Williams cannot play.

Reggie Wayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Wayne (knee) is expected to return this week. Don't expect him to do much in the return from his latest injury. A rookie receiver who has not played regularly is always a Fantasy risk.

Lamar Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 11/29/01
Smith is listed as probable for Sunday's game with a shoulder injury. The Miami RB hasn't played well recently, and he isn't the must-start player he was in 2000.

Daunte Culpepper <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 11/29/01
Culpepper was scheduled to undergo an MRI Wednesday night as a result of continued stiffness in his left knee. He sat out most drills during Wednesday's practice, but is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The Vikings believe Culpepper may have sprained ligaments in the knee, and the severity should be known sometime Thursday. Hold off on making a decision on starting him for now.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=! 70! 5&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 11/29/01
Gadsden is listed as probable for Sunday's game with a shoulder injury. The Miami receiver hasn't been consistently productive this year, and he is a risky start even when his health is not an issue.

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 11/29/01
Favre practiced Wednesday and reported improvement in the sore back that had hampered him after Week 11. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Jacksonville, and you shouldn't be afraid to start him in your Fantasy league this week.

Tyrone Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=! 14! 99&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
There is a possibility Davis, who has missed the first 10 games of the season with a hamstring injury, could be activated in time for Monday's game against Jacksonville. He probably wouldn't be one of the top two tight ends, however, and we're skeptical that he will be able to help any Fantasy teams the remainder of the season.

Terry Glenn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 11/29/01
Glenn (hamstring) is now listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Jets, but may be soon downgraded to questionable and may be placed on injured reserve, says the Boston Globe. He worked out with players who were unable to practice on Wednesday, but did ! no! t work out in pads with the full squad.

Charlie Batch <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Batch practiced Wednesday and showed no ill effects of the pulled groin that forced him out of last Thursday's game against Green Bay. He is expected to start Sunday against Chicago, but is only worth using in Fantasy leagues if you have no other reliable QB on your roster.

James Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/29/01
Stewart's ankle, which kept him out of four straight games prior to last Sunday, is still a source of constant pain, according ! to! the Detroit Free Press. "My ankle's still sore," he said. "It's something that's going to bother me, and I don't think it's going to stop bothering me until the season's over. Hopefully, I can just get through the season without further injuring it, and continue to play on it." Stewart remains a good play in Fantasy leagues only based on the matchup - this week's game against the Bears is unfavorable, so only use him if you're lacking in options at running back.

Anthony Thomas <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 11/29/01
Thomas ran lightly in practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit due to a pulled right hamstring. He hopes to practice Thursday, and a decision on his status for the game might come later in the week, possibl! y ! Saturday. If Thomas can't go, expect James Allen to get the start. Hold off on starting either back until it's clear who will be getting the bulk of the carries against the weak Lions rush defense.

Tony Gonzalez <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 11/29/01
Gonzalez should post good numbers against the Eagles. Philadelphia strong safety Damon Moore may have trouble handling the big, athletic tight end. At 5-11, 215 pounds, he becomes the one obvious mismatch for the Chiefs to exploit in the passing game.

Trent Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 11/29/01
Green, who has been a Fantasy disappointment this year, may be in for a rough night against the Eagles. Philadelphia will blitz him often, and their cornerbacks will easily handle the mediocre Chiefs receivers. 

Todd Pinkston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Hunter Updated 11/29/01
Don't expect much from Pinkston, even against the erratic Chiefs defense. The Philadelphia wideout has not responded well to increased defensive attention after he played well early in the year.

Frank Player News

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1028&>, Active QB Updated 11/29/01
Favre practiced Wednesday and reported improvement in the sore back that had hampered him after Week 11. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Jacksonville, and you shouldn't be afraid to start him in your Fantasy league this week.

Maurice Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=188183&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/29/01
Smith is dealing with both neck and ankle injuries, but he was able to practice on Wednesday. He has been losing carries to Bob Christian in recent weeks, however, and playing against a tough Rams' defense doesn't bode well for his chances for Fantasy success. 

Olandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=133291&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/26/01
The Broncos placed Gary on injured reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman to the active roster. This officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursday. Drop him from your roster.

Jake Plummer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1003&>, Reserve QB Updated 11/25/01
Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best. 

Garrison Hearst <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1164&>, Active RB Updated 11/25/01
Hearst had 106 yards rushing and two touchdowns against Indianapolis on Sunday. Hearst has had three consecutive solid weeks, and is proving his worth as a Fantasy player. 

James Thrash <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1859&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/25/01
Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inconsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1236&>, Active WR Updated 11/21/01
Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you have to keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league. He might have less impressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough to catch more passes than most receivers in the league.

Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1294&>, Active WR Updated 11/21/01
Bruce had a huge game against New England last weekend, posting seven catches for 130 yards. Look for him to have a solid game in Week 11 against a Tampa Bay defense that is vulnerable to the big play. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1593&>, Active WR Updated 11/21/01
Schroeder caught four passes for 55 yards and a touchdown last weekend against Atlanta. He's been one of the more reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and should have a huge game vs. Detroit's weak secondary. 

Corey Dillon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1681&>, Active RB Updated 11/21/01
Definitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up against the Browns on Sunday. He has a great career record against Cleveland (678 rushing yards, five rushing TDs in five games). Dillon should remain in your active lineup week in and week out in any league.

Terance Mathis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1189&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/19/01
Mathis had by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina. If you play in a deeper league, you may want to consider starting Mathis against the Panthers' weak pass defense. 

Titans <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=29&>, Active DT Updated 11/06/01
Linebacker Randall Godfrey suffered torn cartilage in his left knee during Sunday's win over Jacksonville. He'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and will be listed as questionable for Monday's game against Baltimore. 

Dorsey Levens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1107&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

David Akers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1666&>, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.
