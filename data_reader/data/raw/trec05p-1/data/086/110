Latest NFL Player News

Jeff Garcia <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=146325&>, QB SF - Fear Updated 10/18/01
According to published reports, Garcia has been instructed not to pick up a football until the Niners begin practicing again next week. Garcia is dealing with a sore throwing elbow, as well as a few other nagging bumps and bruises. However, he's still expected to start in the 49ers' next game on Oct. 28 against Chicago. 

Peerless Price <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Grigsby Updated 10/18/01
Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacks! on! ville's secondary is thin because of injuries.

Eric Moulds <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1196&>, WR BUF - Fear Updated 10/18/01
Moulds might get in the end zone against Jacksonville. Look for the Bills to move him around often against the injury-riddled Jaguars secondary.

Larry Centers <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1072&>, RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Centers has been Buffalo's most reliable receiver so far, but that trend might change against Jacksonville. Buffalo might look to attack an injury-riddled Jaguars secondary with passes to WR Peerless Price and TE Jay Riemersma.

Drew Bledsoe <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&leagu! e=! ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1041&>, QB NE - Top Dogs Updated 10/18/01
There's a very slim chance Bledsoe will be in uniform as the emergency quarterback this week . Bledsoe was upgraded from "out" to "doubtful" on the injury report, but he's lost 15 pounds and hasn't been cleared to run, throw or be hit. He has pedaled a stationary bicycle and probably would just hand off the ball if Brady and No. 2 quarterback Damon Huard are sidelined. Bledsoe's progress has been slower than he hoped and there's no timetable for his return. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Pink Panthers Updated 10/18/01
Wheatley won't practice during the team's week off and could possibly miss the next game because of an injured right knee. "Tyrone Wheatley has a second degree - ! I ! don't know if it's a sprain or a tear - of his MCL,"' coach Jon Gruden said Wednesday. Gruden called Wheatley questionable for the Oct. 28 game at Philadelphia. He said he would learn more about the injury as the week progressed. He disputed reports that Wheatley would be out four weeks. "I would not agree with that at this time," Gruden said. 

Chris Weinke <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Weinke sat out practice Wednesday and it's uncertain whether he will play in Washington on Sunday because of a thigh injury. The injury is more serious than the Panthers first expected. Seifert said Monday that Weinke had a deep thigh bruise, but expected him to practice Wednesday. Seifert said he didn't know if Weinke would practice Thursday. Dameyune Craig would start if Weinke cannot play.

Brian Griese <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=12409&>, QB DEN - TayDang Updated 10/18/01
Griese said Wednesday his sore shoulder has improved and ! he! 's confident he'll play Sunday against San Diego. Griese complained of shoulder soreness after a hit against the Kansas City Chiefs on Oct. 7. The problem was aggravated Sunday when he was slammed to the turf by Seattle Seahawks defensive end Lamar King. Tests Monday showed no structural damage to his shoulder. 

Redskins <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=30&>, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained ankle, but he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if he's unable to go. 

Rob Moore <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1183&>, WR ARI - FJS Updated 10/17/01
Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, however, so don't be surprised if his status is downgraded over the next two days. 

Patrick Jeffers <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1515&>, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1203&>, WR CAR - TayDang Updated 10/17/01
Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad if at al! l ! possible. 

Chris Weinke <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense. 

Terance Mathis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Pink Panthers Updated 10/17/01
Mathis (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy perspective. 
Shawn Jefferson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to use Fantasy-wise. 

Ryan Leaf <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time. 

! Troy Hambrick <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=194768&!>, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point. 

Michael Bennett <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.

Randy Moss <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Metz Updated 10/17/01
! Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start.

Shane Matthews <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=4719&>, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.

Terrell Davis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Davis would like to return to the lineup Su! nd! ay at San Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, although this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any Broncos running back. 

Stacey Mack <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous. 

Keenan McCardell <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1235&>, WR JAC - FJS Updated 10/17/01
McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot of passes. 

Sean Dawkins <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&r! an! dom=2098&key=1230&>, WR JAC - The Rocks Updated 10/17/01
Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone. 

Mark Brunell <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1032&>, QB JAC - FJS Updated 10/17/01
Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score. 

Kyle Brady <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1356&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is listed as probable. He won't be too productive if he does pl! ay! . Brady only has five catches this season. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/17/01
Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.

Herman Moore <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1222&>, WR DET - Top Dogs Updated 10/17/01
Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. "We're disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought," Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. "We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the muscle." Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy team.! L! arry Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Pink Panthers Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.

Charlie Garner <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Grigsby Updated 10/17/01
The Contra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's "workhorse" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.

Grigsby Player News

Peerless Price <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=133393&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/18/01
Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacksonville's secondary is thin because of injuries.

Charlie Garner <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1149&>, Active RB Updated 10/17/01
The Contra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's "workhorse" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.

Joey Galloway <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1286&>, Active WR Updated 10/17/01
Galloway (ankle) is expected to take this week off from practice in order to rest his injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his status for the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1109&>, Active RB Updated 10/16/01
Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday's game against the New York Jets despite a bruised right knee. "He really could possibly play this week," coach Mike Martz said. "We're not going to rule the possibility of him playing completely out." If Faulk is unable to go, however, Trung Canidate will be the featured back in the game. At this point, it's tough to make a decision on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the situation throughout the week. 

Tiki Barber <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1782&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/16/01
Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring any setbacks, Barber will be available for Monday's game against Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks. 

Germane Crowell <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=12306&>, Active WR Updated 10/14/01
Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, catching nine passes for 125 yards and a score. He's still not consistent enough to use every week at this point, but he's easily worth a roster spot if available. 

Hines Ward <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=12795&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/14/01
Ward had another solid outing. While he caught four passes for only 38 yards, he did catch a five-yard TD pass, once again proving he is the only reliable wideout on the Pittsburgh roster,

Peyton Manning <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=12531&>, Active QB Updated 10/12/01
Manning should throw at least two TD passes against Oakland. The Raiders' secondary runs hot and cold, and sometimes has trouble with marquee quarterbacks.

Jaguars <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=13&>, Active DT Updated 09/23/01
Jacksonville's defense was solid once again, holding the Tennessee Titans to just six points on Sunday. They've allowed a total of nine points in their first two games of the season, and are worth picking up should they still be available in your league. 

Chargers <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=24&>, Reserve DT Updated 08/19/01
Defensive end Marcellus Wiley missed Saturday's game against the Miami Dolphins due to a sore hamstring. Defensive tackle Jamal Williams suffered a sprained knee in the game and could miss up to three weeks, and cornerback Alex Molden sustained a slight groin injury. None of these injuries are considered serious. San Diego made some improvements to their defensive unit during the offseason, and might be worth using when your starting defense has a bye week. 

Carl Pickens <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1211&>, Active WR Updated 05/30/01
Weakened by a chronic hamstring problem that was showing no improvement over the offseason, Pickens has decided to retire after eight NFL seasons. Pickens, 31, signed a one-year, $500,000 contract earlier this spring with the Dallas Cowboys. But, after missing all of the minicamps and visiting with noted Birmingham, Ala., orthopedist James Andrews he decided to end his career. 

Troy Aikman <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1019&>, Reserve QB Updated 04/09/01
Aikman has decided to retire. Two sources close to Aikman said the 12-year veteran, released by the Cowboys last month, will officially announce his retirement at a Monday afternoon news conference. 

Brett Conway <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1385&>, Active K Updated 12/22/00
Head Coach Al Groh won't make a decision until Sunday, but a source close to the Jets says that Groh is leaning towards using Conway for placekicking and Hall for kickoffs. Either way, Fantasy owners should avoid using either of the Jets' kickers in their final week of the season.
