Dear St. Arnold's Army: 

Happy New Year!  First, we want to thank everyone for helping us increase our sales 25% in 2001!  It was our best year ever.  And to celebrate, we recommend going out and immediately buying several cases of St. Arnold's.  OK, perhaps that was a bit over the top.  I apologize.  How about this?  Have all your friends go out and buy several cases of our beer!  Thanks again.  Your support truly is important to us. 

The Stout is Out 
Available in the stores, that is.  But you better stock up quickly, because it will only be available for another couple of weeks.  The Spring Bock is lagering and waiting to be unleashed as soon as the Stout is gone. 

Cigar Night II - January 23, 2002 
The first cigar night was so popular that we decided to do it again.  This time it will be on a Wednesday.  You need to make reservations for this and either secure it with a credit card or mail us a check.  We are limiting attendance.  Jeffrey Stone Limited will be supplying the cigars again (we are in the process of choosing the cigars for the evening). 

Admission: $20 (includes the two cigars)  
Date: January 23 
Time: 6 pm - 9 pm  
Where: Saint Arnold Brewery 
       2522 Fairway Park Dr. 

To make your reservation, please either email, mail or call Dan with the following info: 
Your Name: 
Number of People in your Group: 
Credit Card Number: 
(we will not be running the credit cards until the night of the event, so if you want to pay cash at the door, that will be an option.) 

The Hopwaiian Shirts are Here!  Come tonight and pick yours up! 
After a month of being promised that the shirts were on their way followed by their sitting in Customs for a week, the Hopwaiian shirts are finally here.  For those of you who ordered one to be mailed, they are already in the mail.  For the rest of you, we are having a special "Come to the Brewery and Pick Up Your Shirt and Listen to Us Say 'We're Sorry' a Bunch of Times and Drink Some Beer So You Won't Be Upset Party" tonight (1/4).  They made it in time for Christmas - on the Orthodox Calendar (January 7)!   

Hopwaiian Shirt Party at the Brewery 
Tonight January 4, 2002 
5 pm - 8 pm 
Who's Invited?  Anyone who ordered a shirt and their guest!  You can also be invited if you come and purchase a shirt tonight.   

The Julian Calendar New Year Party at Garden in the Heights 
In keeping with our Orthodox calendar discussion, the Julian Calendar New Year is coming, so if you want to relive the fun of New Year's Eve again, come on out. This is still the best European bash in town and the place to ring in the year while dancing everything from the polka and the kolomyjka, waltz, two-step, schottische, frailach, czardas, hassapiko, mazurka to jigs and reels.  The Gypsies will head up the entertainment joined by top ethnic musicians from across the state, a colorful blend of ethnic music and dance from Russia and Eastern Europe. An exotic assortment of traditional Eastern European, Balkan and Russian food and drink will be served. An outdoor bazaar will be set up with craft vendors and a gypsy camp around a roaring fire to ward off the winter chill (in the event of rain, the whole event will move inside the old-world-style Great Hall). 
Date and Time: Sunday, January 13TH, 2002 - 5:00 PM - Midnight 
Place:  GARDEN in the HEIGHTS, 3926 Feagan (One block north of Memorial, two blocks west of Waugh Dr./Heights Blvd.) 
Entertainment: The Gypsies and friends, Russian Dancers, Belly Dancers, Tango Dancers, Other performers to be announced 
Food: Traditional Russian and Eastern European dishes including borscht, goulash, pirogues, and more. 
Beer:  Really good stuff 
Admission: $4 with this email, $8 without it. Children 12 and under Free. 

Thanks again for all your support, and remember to recycle your six pack carriers.  Have a great year, and we look forward to seeing you soon. 

Cheers,
