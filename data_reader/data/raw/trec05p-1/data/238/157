  Fouad Allam, a retired general in Egypt's anti-terrorism security appara=
tus, said there is no way to compare the recent attacks with those in the =
1990s, which were led by larger, more organized groups that have since bee=
n marginalized by a protracted, harsh government crackdown.Less than two h=
ours later, two veiled women -- reportedly the man's sister and fiancee --=
 attacked a tour bus. Egyptian police officials and the government-guided =
Al-Ahram newspaper said the bus was carrying Israeli tourists.
