Latest NFL Player News

Derrick Mason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1816&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Mason caught eight passes for 107 yards and a TD against Green Bay. Right now, he is one of Fantasy Football's best wideouts in terms of consistency. 

Skip Hicks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=12436&>, RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Hicks rushed for 142 yards and a TD as the Titans used him often to give a banged-up Eddie George some breathers. Expect to see more of Hicks from the Titans in the final weeks of the year, although George will remain the te! am! 's top RB option.

Antonio Freeman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1226&>, WR GB - Hunter Updated 12/16/01
The Titans limited Freeman to 42 yards on two catches. If your team is moving on in the playoffs, however, you can expect better numbers from Freeman in the weeks ahead. 

Ahman Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 12/16/01
Green had an awful outing at Tennessee, finishing with just nine rushing yards and 24 receiving yards. Expect him to quickly rebound from such a poor performance. 

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/16/01
Davis had a big game for Washington, posting 146 all-purpose yards against Philadelphia. He was held out of the end zone, but Davis is still worthy of starting consideration in most Fantasy leagues. 

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Banks' numbers were subpar against Philadelphia. He threw for 186 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in the game, and isn't reliable enough to be considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Darrell Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.! sp! ortsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 12/16/01
Jackson caught four passes for 85 yards against Dallas. He continues to be one of the most underrated and reliable receivers in the AFC. 

Donovan McNabb <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 12/16/01
McNabb had a decent outing against Washington, throwing for 235 yards and two touchdowns. He did throw three interceptions as well, but McNabb will be a solid starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Shaun Alexan! de! r <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=187382&> , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 12/16/01
Alexander carried seven times for 27 yards and a TD in relief of an injured Ricky Watters on Sunday. He saw limited action until Watters went down in the second half, and his playing time may continue to be sparse when Watters is healthy.

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/16/01
Smith was virtually useless on Sunday, running for only 39 yards on 12 carries vs. Seattle. Smith can be productive when he gets enough carries, but he's a real gamble during the Fantasy playoffs otherwise.




Quincy Carter! , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01Carter had a horrible game on Sunday, going 14-of-33 for 135 yards with an interception against Seattle. He has no value as a Fantasy player in any league.  <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=235201&>Daunte Culpepper <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 12/16/01
Culpepper will probably need to undergo arthroscopic surgery this week on a sprained left knee that kept him out of the Vikings 27-24 loss to Detroit on Sunday. "It's a small scope, not a big deal at all," Minnesota coach Dennis Green said. "Whether it's a 10-day injury or a two-week injury, you never know." Culpepper had been expected to play this week after sitting out last week. He began the week listed as probable, but was downgraded to doubtful after his knee was still swelling and sore after taking some snaps on Wednesday and Thursday. He sat out of Friday's practice and was officially listed as inactive. 

Lamar Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 12/16/01
Smith carried nine times for only 22 yards at San Francisco. The Miami RB has been very inc! on! sistent in recent weeks, but he still may be good for a few TD runs during the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs. 

Todd Pinkston <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Hunter Updated 12/16/01
Pinkston left Sunday's game against Washington in the fourth quarter with a shoulder injury. He did not return to the contest, and finished with two catches for 77 yards and a score. 

Jay Fiedler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=12363&>, QB MIA - Tori Updated 12/16/01
Fiedler threw for 149 yards, no TDs and was intercepted three times at San Francisco. The Miami QB is too erratic to be a regular starter for any Fantasy team during the playoffs.

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Watters left Sunday's game against Dallas in the fourth quarter with an injured right ankle. He was replaced by Shaun Alexander.

Garrison Hearst <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1164&>, RB SF - Frank Updated 12/16/01
Hearst rushed for 103 yards on 26 carries against Miami on Sunday. He was held out of the end zone, but Hearst is still a good enough ! pl! ayer to start during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Jeff Garcia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 12/16/01
garcia left Sunday's game with sore ribs in the first half, then returned later. Tim Rattay played much of the second half in his place.

Scotty Anderson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=235015&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Anderson caught one pass for 69 yards against Minnesota. He will catch an occasional long ball, but Anderson is not producing enough to be useful for most Fantasy teams right now. 

Mike McMahon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
McMahon threw for 241 yards and rushed for 74 yards and a TD against Minnesota. He will be a sevicable backup during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Cris Carter <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 12/16/01
The Lions held Carter to 30 yards on three catches. Still, the veteran receiver is too experienced and potentially productive to bench during any week of the Fantasy playoffs. 

M! ichael Bennett <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Bennett rushed for only 40 yards on 10 carries at Detroit. The rookie back is too inconsistent to rely on during the Fantasy postseason. 

Peerless Price <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Price caught four passes for 67 yards against New England. He appears to be Buffalo's most reliable Fantasy player at this time. 

Alex Van Pelt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1011&>, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
The Patriots limited Van Pelt to 219 passing yards, no TDs and one interception. Right now, the Buffalo QB is not playing well enough to start for any Fantasy team. 

Terry Glenn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 12/16/01
The Bills held Glenn to 27 yards on three catches. Glenn has missed too much time this year to regularly post good numbers for New England. 

Tom Brady <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=187741&>, QB NE - Martin Updated 12/16/01
Brady had another disappointing game, throwing for 237 yards, no TDs and an interception at Buffalo. All of a sudden, the New England QB appears to! b! e a Fantasy risk during the most important weeks of the year.

Dominic Rhodes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=236986&>, RB IND - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Rhodes rushed for 177 yards and two TDs against Atlanta. The Colts are out of the playoff hunt, yet Rhodes will keep many Fantasy teams in the running for a title. 

Peyton Manning <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=12531&>, QB IND - Neal/McKay Updated 12/16/01
Manning got back on track with 325 passing yards, three TDs and an interception against the Colts. He remains a must-start player in all Fantasy leagues.

Derrick Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 12/16/01
Alexander had four catches for 72 yards and a touchdown against Denver. He's been playing better in recent weeks, but Alexander is still a risky play outside of deeper Fantasy leagues. 

Tony Martin <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Martin caught seven passes for 84 yards and a TD at Indianapolis. Don't expect consistently good numbers from him during the Fantasy postseason.
