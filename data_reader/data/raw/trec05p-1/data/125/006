Still living in the apartment, trying to decide what to do with the house
(repair or rebuild). Things continue to deteriorate with Nadine. Between you
and me I doubt if we'll make it to our 20th anniversary unless it's for
Meaghan's sake.
 
How's your clan? Girls driving you nuts?
 
What's your take on what you'll do with the merger or is it too soon to
call?
 
Take care, Murph.
