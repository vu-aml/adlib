Attached is the revised Torch Energy Exhibit including the column heading changes, the two pooling point changes, and the percentage splits between IFERC and GD. 

Note: If both IFERC and GD volumes were zero for a given point, I made the pricing split as 50/50.

Please review and provide any comments as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Judy
