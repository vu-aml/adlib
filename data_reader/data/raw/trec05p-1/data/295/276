Operating system information

Windows XP is the operating system release that unifies the Microsoft range, with all the
desktop versions now built on the NT/2%OP%OP%OP code base rather than the shakier foundation of
Windows 95, 98, and Me. That makes XP a great upgrade for users of the now-obsolete 9x and
Me line, but for those already on Windows 2%OP%OP%OP Professional it is a closer call. Despite the
similar name, there is no special synergy between Windows XP and Office XP,which works fine
on Windows 2%OP%OP%OP. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spreadsheet information

Microsoft Office XP Professional Edition 2%OP%OP2 is the most complete personal and business 
productivity solution that enables people to manage customers and create impressive marketing
materials, manage e-mail and share information efficiently and securely, and streamline 
business processes-all with familiar, integrated and easy to use software. It provides access
to a leading community of partners and Office Online for additional solutions, training,and support.

How can you sell this software as OEM ?It seems too good to be true - is there a catch?

There is no catch - the software versions that we sell are OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) 
which means you will receive the installation CDs only (they do not come in their original retail
packing and do not include the manual). We do guarantee that all programs are the 1%OP%OP% full working
retail versions - no demos or academic versions! When you order, you will receive all materials
required for a complete installation - or your money back! Why pay hundreds of dollars more when you
can get exactly the same but OEM-CD? You don't have to pay that much for the fancy box and manuals.


Why is your software so inexpensive compared to the other retailers?

We minimize our overhead by stocking mostly top selling software only and try to get the
best deals for them. We also sell what are called OEM versions, the same software as the 
box version without the box and the manual. By foregoing the fancy box and typically slim
manuals you end up saving a considerable amount.

thank you
