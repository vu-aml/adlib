Now that Anthony is away most of the time, I wondered if you still use the
cell phone very often. If not, would you mind if I borrowed it for my trip,
or will it not work up here or enroute? I hate to buy one just for a road
trip, but maybe I should and then stop the service when I get back. Am also
thinking of buying some mace. Never considered it before, but if I had car
trouble, it could be helpful, or at least give me a sense of (false?)
security.

Pres is 50(!) today, and joins the rest of us elite ones.
Love,
Sandy
