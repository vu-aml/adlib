other than wanting to go to Ohio to see my family, not really.  if i can use my vacation in the meantime, that won't be a problem.   

should I make plans to go to Colorado?  or should maggy go in my place?

Any flexibility to move it up to November 1?   If there's no flexibility, that's fine.

Are you kidding?.......if not. I would suggest November 12, the day we are likely to use on a uniform basis.

Rick:  I forgot to ask you about my last day when we talked this morning.  I was hoping that it could be next Friday?   Is that possible?

Thanks,
