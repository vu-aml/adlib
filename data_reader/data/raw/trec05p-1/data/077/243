> notifying you of that information.  I do not appreciate your condescending
> and demeaning attitude.  It is not your place to point out the flaws in
> our decisions or how we might have come up with another scenario.  Keith
> sought Miguel's advice on several occasions as he is the one who is a
> licensed realtor- not you.   Not to mention, that relationship as realtor/
> client ended when we made the decision to stop looking.  Keith has not
> asked for Miguel's advice beyond that point and therefore your criticism
> and advice is unwarranted.  As far as what it is that is upsetting you,
> the only thing you have mentioned is being offended that Keith offered
> Miguel to help facilitate the close.  I do not understand what is
> offensive about offering Miguel to be a part of something when simply all
> he needed to say was no if he was not interested.  However, I respect
> whatever your reasons are and I am sorry if that offended either of you.
> Finally, Keith and I are not 12 years old and it is not acceptable to talk
> to either of us in that manner.   Keith is a senior trader at Enron and
> they employ him to risk millions of dollars each day.  I think he is quite
> capable to make a decision such as this.    As I mentioned before, we
> appreciate all that Miguel did to help previously during the search.  I
