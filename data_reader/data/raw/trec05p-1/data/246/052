Not sure why they just sent it to me.  At any rate, here is the estimate consistent with the scope in the Power Point presentation being prepared for Stan.  

I would say let me know what else I can do, but I'm getting ready for a command performance this afternoon with Horton and head off to spring break vacation with my wife and high school freshman tomorrow.  

I'll be back Monday week.  Actually, Arnold or Mike Smith should be able to answer any questions you may have. 

(oops, I just noticed that the Red Hawk line is about 10 miles shorter here.  Not sure what that is about.
