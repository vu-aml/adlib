Richard:
 
Per Elliot's e-mail below, do you have access to a list of existing EES customers, or do you know where I can find one?
 
Thanks!  Jenny

Jenny,
 
I think the first starting point is to look at our existing EES customer base and divide those customers into different categories according to their potential willingness to purchase green power, with IBM and Johnson and Johnson (members of the Green PowerMarket Development Group) being signature potential green customers. Richard can probably help you find this list. I think we should then look at the membership of several major organizations -- the Business Council on Sustainable Development, the Pew Center on Climate Change, Environmental Defense for starters, to find some other high-profile companies with a stated committment to environmental protection. 
 
Jeff Shields will look at the large commercial and industrial customers targeted in Oregon as they are ENA, not EES target customers (Enron has an arbitrary SEC-code distinction for who ENA targets vs who EES targets and industrial customers are definitely ENA fodder). As for the other industrial accounts in other states, most of them are mines, aluminum smelters and that sort and are probably not our principal target audience.
 
Thx,
 
Elliot
