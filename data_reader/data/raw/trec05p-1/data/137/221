Headline:  "Unocal, Tesoro, Pioneer, Equiva, Reliant Among Energy Companies
Providing Opening-Day Insights at Interactive Energy 2001"

HOUSTON, TEXAS, November 19, 2001 - The opening-day program for Interactive
Energy has been set with presentations from SAP, Booz Allen Hamilton and
case studies and panel discussions from management from such companies as
Reliant, Equiva, Tesoro, Unocal and SAIC.  

Les Amidei, VP of business development for process from SAP America, will
open the session to discuss how energy companies are working to gain maximum
returns from their current investments.  Many of the larger companies
committed to SAP's enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems during the
past 15 years, and new innovations must interface with SAP to access and
uplink enterprise data.

"With all the great promises of the internet, the energy industry has made
numerous investments in information technology," notes Amidei.  "The reality
is that while many have delivered, many [others] have not. As a result, the
overall climate has changed dramatically where any investment in technology
will be driven by measurable and quantifiable ROI. Leveraging existing
investments such as ERP into new arenas will be critical in assuring maximum
value is delivered.""

A panel of senior technology officers, including Xavier Flinois, president,
Schlumberger Network Solutions; Tom Halbouty, CIO, Pioneer Natural
Resources; Paul Cuneo, CIO, Equiva Services LLP; and Ray Cline, CTO, SAIC,
will follow Amidei's presentation.  Each panelist will be asked how he or
she is prioritizing IT spending and levering from investments made in
previous years to maximize profitability. Accenture Partner Jeff Sakaguchi
will direct the discussion.  Then, Eduardo Alvarez, partner of Booz Allen
Hamilton will wrap up the morning with a presentation on how some energy
companies have managed innovation more effectively and what can be learned
from their strategies.  

In the afternoon, the conference will feature the results of an IT survey
conducted by Booz Allen Hamilton and Zeus Development Corporation, which
investigates how the upstream, refining and gas and power sectors are
prioritizing IT spending. The two firms have joined in the research project
to interview information officers at many of the world's leading energy
firms to understand how they are currently managing IT investment.  The
report will enhance and build upon the earlier presentations, providing a
broader industry perspective. 

Then, four case studies will be presented: The first entitled, "Dropping the
'E:' Moving E-Business to Just Business" by
Tim Pownell, general manager, e-procurement project, will discuss how 
Unocal is in the process of fully integrating their e-business systems into
the mainstream practices of the company. 

The second, entitled "Rapid ERP Integration: A New Supervisory Application
to Reduce Training Time and Improve Inventory Accuracy," which will be
presented by Mark Evans, CIO, Tesoro, will discuss how Tesoro was able to
integrate its marine logistics unit into the broader SAP ERP to improve
performance, inventory accuracy and employee satisfaction. 

The third and fourth presentations will be made by management from Reliant
Resources Inc. to describe how they are using IT to prepare for Texas'
forthcoming deregulated marketplace.  Will Symmes, director - energy
information systems, will describe how Reliant has developed an
internet-based energy information and analysis portal for large industrial
customers, entitled "Energy Commander."  Then, Ron Orsini, vice president -
eBusiness, will discuss how Reliant is investigating home automation
technology to better serve residential and small business accounts. 

"We're very pleased with the lineup for Wednesday and believe it provides a
most important full-day forum for the opening discussion of Interactive
Energy," said Nimocks. "In the final analysis, our job is to facilitate the
exchange of information and ideas so advancements can be made more
efficiently, and this lineup promises to do that."
