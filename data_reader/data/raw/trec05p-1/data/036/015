Attn:President/Director

I am pleased to get across to you for a very urgent and profitable
business proposal, though I don't know you, neither have I seen you
before but my confidence was reposed on you with the good Faith I
had in GOD. I am a Staff of United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA),
Ilupeju branch, Lagos Nigeria. The intended business is thus; We
had a customer, a Foreigner, Resident in Nigeria,Named Late Mr.John
Mike of England, he was a Contractor with one of the Government
Parastatals. He has in his Account in our branch the sum of US
27.5Million (Twenty-Seven million five hundred thousand united
states dollars only). Unfortunately, the man died three years ago
until today non-of his next of kin has come forward to claim the
money.

Having noticed this, I in collaboration with two other top
Officials of the bank have covered up the account all this while.
Now we want you (being a foreigner) to be fronted as one of his
next of kin and forward your account and other relevant documents
to be advised to you by us to attest to the Claim. We will use our
positions to get all internal documentations to back up the claims.
The whole procedures will last only five working days to get the
fund retrieved successfully without trace even now or in future.
Your response is only what we are waiting for as we have arranged
all necessary things. As soon as this message comes to you kindly
get back to me indicating your interest, then I will furnish you
with the whole procedures to ensure that the deal is successfully
concluded.

For your assistance we have agreed to give you twenty five percent
(25%) of the Total sum at the end of the transaction while 65%
would be for my colleagues and I and the remaining 10% would be for
any form of expenses that may be incurred during the course of the
transaction which would be given to us when the money is
transferred into your account before splitting the balance on the
agreed percentage of 65% to 25%. In order to get all the legal
documents from the court, kindly send the following information to
us immediately. Your full name, telephone, mobile and fax numbers
as well as your resident or company address.

We have in our disposal,the Certificate of Deposit that he used in
Depositing the Fund in our bank,also with us is his Death
Certificate as Proof of the fund,as soon as we hear from you
soon,we will quickly forward them to you.

I await your earliest response.

Thanks,

Yours Sincerely,

DR Jude Abey
