Financial Analysis
==================
Retail sales of pet food are projected for a steady climb, rising to an estimated $16.7 billion by 2008.

Sales in the natural food and supplement category are increasing by double digits each year as consumers grow more
aware of what goes into their pets' food.

RYPM plans to make synergistic acquisitions to propel faster growth and gain market dominance

RYPM Plans expansion of services into "niche" markets

Management believes that it would be entirely realistic for the Company to capture at least one percent of the market each
year for i! ts first five years in the business.This would equate to revenues growing from $200 million in its first year of
operations to in excess of $1 billion annually (just 5% of market share) five years out!


Corporate Snapshot
==================
Royal Pet Meals, Inc. is an emerging growth development and management company that specializes in using niche marketing
techniques to deliver "specialty" pet foods/products to the rapidly expanding $34 billion (2004 estimate) pet products industry.
Royal Pet Meal products are all premium meal selections, natural, organic, and wholesome, all designed to improve the
quality of life for pet and pet owners. Since a large percentage of this booming pet market is serviced by small business vendors,
Royal Pet Meals management feels that! this highly fragmented marketplace lends itself to both niche marketing and consolidation
of vendors. Royal Pet Meals, Inc. intends to capture various niche markets and acquire/merge with selected profitable vendors,
realizing significant revenue and profit growth as a result.

Analyst Conclusion
==================
The recent SEC ruling to leave the Over The Counter Bulletin Board in its current form is a very bullish sign for this market - possibly
a turning point. We think that this is an encouraging signal from regulators that the OTCBB can expect a more positive financial
climate going forward. We assessed RYPM and found it met our 4 basic investment criteria:

1. Clearly RYPM has enormous growth potential.
2. The company financials are strong.
3. RYPM is in a leading i! ndustry.
4. RYPM is offered at an ideal Buy Point.

Pets are big business and everyone is getting interested. In the space of the past four weeks, the Today Show has run two segments,
the CBS Early Show each ran a segment, ABC World News Tonight ran a piece, US News and World Report ran a piece about
Global Pet Expo and The Wall Street Journal ran an article on the industry. This is in addition to the numerous articles run in
everything from the LA Times and Washington Post to the East Nowhere Gazette Sun Journal.
The word is out and we all should be ready to take advantage of it.
