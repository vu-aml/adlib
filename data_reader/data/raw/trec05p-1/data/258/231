   Word of the Day for Saturday March 30, 2002:

   friable \FRY-uh-buhl\, adjective:
   Easily crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder.

     Just  as  sometimes I feel that reading some of those books
     on  very friable yellow paper that come apart in your hand,
     and  come  unglued from the spine, and the print's all over
     the  page, and it seems to have been written for people who
     have  magnifying  lenses in their glasses, that's hard work
     too.
     --Angela Carter, [1]Shaking a Leg: Collected Writings

     The  house  was  so  alive  with vermin and tiny despicable
     things that it seemed no more than a shell surrounding him,
     crackling and friable and the same color in all its shadows
     as a forest.
     --Anne Rice, [2]The Vampire Armand
     _________________________________________________________

   Friable  comes  from  Latin  friabilis,  from friare, "to rub,
   break, or crumble into small pieces."
