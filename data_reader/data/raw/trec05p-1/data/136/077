Has anybody produced a 'disclosure policy' for the Data Protection Act or  a general policy on this subject?

If you could send me a copy i would appreciate it.

Also, the engineering constuction IR issue at Lundbeck chemicals, over 2nd tier payments, is, according to my sources unlikely to spread to other sites. However if you have any 'intelligence' on this subject, i would appreciate a call or an e-mail.

Thanks,
Geoff Baines
