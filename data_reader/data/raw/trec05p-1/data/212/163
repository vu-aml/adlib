John, I appreciate your giving the sublists a once-over.  I'll reply to
your comments in the order you wrote them.

BP 4 says, in essence, "Before you sell a transmission right, make sure
your grid can support it."  The gist of BP 9 is: "If your Transmission
Customer wants to move energy someplace not mentioned in the purchased
transmission right, but you can still fit it in, then let it flow
anyway."  At the ESC meeting, I was looking past the linkage statement
about these two BPs, instead focusing on the fact that BP 4 is really an
"OASIS" practice while BP 9 is about energy scheduling.  Now, though, in
the tranquility of my office, I'm inclined to agree that they should
still be considered together.  Both of these BPs give you a choice
between path and flowgate models (and the more granular the flowgate
model, the closer you get to a purely financial transmission market), so
how would you feel about calling both of them "model-independent"?

BP 25 discusses fragmentary scheduling (i.e., letting a group of
entities in the transaction chain submit pieces of a schedule which,
when pieced together, form a complete and continuous schedule).  As
written, the BP doesn't seem to tie us to any particular transmission
model, because the fragments could conceivably use any combination of
physical and financial transmission rights.  So this BP would appear to
belong in the "model independent" category.

We in the West have suggested a rewording of BP 1, 10 and 12 (hopefully,
soon to be shared with the ESC) to allow regions like ours to minimize
the operational impact of changing the frequency and duration of
non-emergency generator ramping.  As drafted, these changes would have
no effect on current practices in the East, so more than one version of
each BP would be unnecessary.

The "Applicability" section of BP 24 reads, in part: "This Business
Practice addresses the implementation of a curtailment/reload by (a
Scheduling Authority).  It does not address the  process items leading
up to the curtailment ..."  I would say that BP 24 does not depend on
the choice of congestion management method selected.

By the way, I'm sharing these comments with ESC Business Practice Task
Force Chair Mike McElhany, who is apportioning the BP discussions among
a series of conference calls to begin as early as January 30.

Thank you, John, for your valuable input.

John, just a couple of quick comments. 

First BP 9 is identified as an "independent issue" and BP 4 is
identified as
a "dependent Issues", yet both of these BP's work in tandem.  I would
think
both of these should be "dependent",  unless I am missing something.  I
guess I would have the same comment for BP #25.

The last page describes BP's (1, 10, and 12) that the WSCC is asking to
be
worked independently.  I am not sure what this means - a West and East
proposal for each of these practices?  

Does BP 24 (Curtailments and Reloads) assume a common (nationwide)
Congestion Management scheme, or is this BP totally unrelated or
insignificant to any Congestion Management scheme (physical or
financial)?


Thanks John,


John Canavan
