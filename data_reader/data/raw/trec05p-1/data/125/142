You need to change the definition of Transaction in the first WHEREAS clause and then you can send it.

I could put together a list we have copies of them in the legal dept.  What do you want to use the list for??

Lee,

I made the changes to the Duke confidentiality agreement that you sent me, basically just the name changes.  Is there anything else I need to do, or can I just print this out and send it to them?  Please let me know.

Also,  Is there a list of companies that have a confientiality agreement with Transwestern?
