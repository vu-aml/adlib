Paul,

Guess that makes you the baddest bull in the pasture [now you've got to deal
with all those admiring cows].

You ought to take the kids to Dallas for indoctrination as the Longhorns win
the Big XII championship again.

We're still not walking up here, but there was some excitement when Janell
got a right shoe on [not for long].  I'm very concerned at this point about
our mini-Imelda investment in ladies footwear and the Docs lack of expressed
confidence about the swelling ever subsiding totally.  It's hell to be old
{Janell tells me}.

Oh well, at least we're not all working for bankrupt companies...

Thanx,
Dennis
