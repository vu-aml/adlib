NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Kevin Dyson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=12342&>, WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 11/30/01
Dyson is recovering from a toe injury, but is expected to play Sunday. He is listed as questionable. Don't look for good numbers from Dyson this week. The injury will likely slow him down a bit. 

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 11/30/01
Even though George's stats have been on the decline it will be hard to find a better running back on waivers. George has struggled recently but is still a must-start every week. 

Frank Wycheck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/30/01
Wycheck, still suffering from an ankle injury is expected to play in Sunday's game. However, he is listed as questionable. Don't expect him to be too productive. 

Hines Ward <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 11/30/01
Ward doesn't score often, but has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year. He will always post respectable totals so keep him in your lineup every week. 

Kyle Brady <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1356&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. Don't expect him to be too productive. Check and see if there is a more productive tight end on the waiver wires before settling on him. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Frank Updated 11/30/01
Despite his recent troubles off the field, Smith is still one of the best receivers. Look for him to catch some passes this week and be a solid No. 2 wideout. 

Tim Couch <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&! ow! ner=14696.2&random=4576&key=133260&>, QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Couch has been solid this season despite the lack of a solid No. 2 wideout. He will be a good pickup if you are looking for starting QB. 

Quincy Morgan <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=235232&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Morgan might regain his starting job this week, but don't expect him to be too productive. He has only caught 22 passes this season, two of which are TDs. 

Darnay Scott <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1212&>, WR CIN - JWillie Updated 11/30/01
Don't expect Scott to be too productive this week. He only has two TD catches this season. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Expect Grbac to have a solid game this week against the Colts. Indianapolis has allowed 17 TD passes this season. 

Travis Taylor <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=187399&>, WR BAL - Russell Updated 11/30/01
Taylor has been unproductive this season. However, he could experience some success this week against a shaky Colts defense. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige! 01! &owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 11/30/01
Hasselbeck has been playing well in recent weeks, but he isn't putting up great Fantasy numbers. He is looked upon to avoid mistakes, not to win games for Seattle. As a result, Hasselbeck isn't worth more than a reserve role on your Fantasy team. 

Darrell Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 11/30/01
Jackson has been playing well in recent weeks, and he should have another good week against San Diego. The Chargers pass defense has been in question in recent weeks, so starting Jackson in deeper leagues is advisable. 

Charlie Garner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 11/30/01
Garner is a must-start against Arizona in Week 12. He faces a great matchup against the Cardinals, who have one of the worst defenses in the entire league. 

Jerry Rice <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1291&>, WR OAK - Neal/McKay Updated 11/30/01
Rice still has plenty of life in his 39 year old legs, and he'll prove it on Sunday against Arizona. The Cards are one of the worst teams in the league against the pass, so starting Rice in Week 12 is advisable. 

Tim Brown <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=playe! rs! &league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/30/01
Brown should have a field day against Arizona on Sunday. The Cardinals secondary is very vulnerable to solid passing teams, so look for the veteran wideout to have a big day. 

Tom Brady <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=187741&>, QB NE - Martin Updated 11/30/01
Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, so starting him in Week 12 is a wise move. 

Troy Brown <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull! Updated 11/30/01
Brown has been one of the most reliable Fantasy players in the league this season. He had five catches for 82 yards in his first meeting of the year against the Jets, and is a solid play for Fantasy owners this week. 

David Patten <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1790&>, WR NE - JWillie Updated 11/30/01
Patten's numbers have been down somewhat in recent weeks. He's still worth Fantasy consideration in Week 12, however, but only in deeper leagues. 

Curtis Martin <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1132&>, RB NYJ - Tori Updated 11/30/01
The Jets offe! ns! e will continue to be the "Curtis Martin Show" in Week 12. He's been one of the more reliable Fantasy players in the league, and is far too valuable to ever bench. 

Vinny Testaverde <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1007&>, QB NYJ - Neal/McKay Updated 11/30/01
Due to the new conservative offense in New York, Testaverde isn't the reliable Fantasy player he once was. He's not even worth a roster spot in some leagues, and is no better than a reserve in others. 

Anthony Becht <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=187740&>, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Becht has been very unreliable this season as a Fantasy player. Unless you're desperate for a tight end in Week 12, benching Becht is advisable. 

Laveranues Coles <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/30/01
Coles is New York's best receiving threat, which makes him worthy of Fantasy consideration in any week. He'll face a decent New England secondary in Week 12, but starting him is still a good option, especially in deeper leagues. 

Chris Chambers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Chambers had a huge against Buffalo last week catching f! iv! e passes for 101 yards and two touchdowns. He's the best rookie wideout in the NFL, and is worth starting in deeper Fantasy leagues. 

James McKnight <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
McKnight could find some success downfield against a questionable Denver secondary in Week 12. However, he's only worth taking a chance on in deeper Fantasy leagues. 

Marvin Harrison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1231&>, WR IND - Russell Updated 11/30/01
Harrison had a huge game against San Francisco in Week 11, catching eight passes for 128 yards and a touchdown. He may have a tough time putting up those kind of numbers against Baltimore, but he's still a must-start for Fantasy owners. 

Marcus Pollard <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1335&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Pollard has become one of Peyton Manning's favorite targets this season. He's may not be the most consistent tight end in the league, but his potential to score touchdowns makes him worth starting every week. 

Ken Dilger <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1334&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Dilger has been a major disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. With Marcus Pollard emerging as the Colts primary tight end, Dilger has very little Fantasy value. 

Terrence Wilkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Wilkins will likely start in place of the injured Reggie Wayne in Week 12. Playing against a tough Baltimore defense isn't to his advantage, however, so starting Wilkins is a gamble. 

Derrick Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/30/01
Alexander caught only four passes for 39 yards, but he did score his second touchdown of the season. However, he's still too unreliable to start every week.
