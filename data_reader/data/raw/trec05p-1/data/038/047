                      At $129, it's a Gift!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear Jeffrey,

Now, until October 1, 2001, when you buy the Palm(TM) 
m100 handheld for just $129 you'll receive three stylish 
faceplates for free! That's over $49 in savings.

This special package makes a gift that anyone would love. 
Buy one for a friend or a loved one, and they'll probably 
think you paid a lot more than you actually did.

So give someone the gift of organization with these 
helpful tools:

* Date book
* To do list
* Calculator
* Address book
* Memo pad

All this, plus three interchangeable faceplates makes it 
easy to match anyone's mood. It's all available for the 
limited-time price of $129, which makes it the perfect 
gift. Just don't forget to remove the price tag! Click 
below to purchase. Or call 1-800-881-7256 to order via 
phone.
