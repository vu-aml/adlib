This is Not a  Joke. 
Warning received from Police...please read and pass 
along  
A t t e n t i o n : 
This is very scary and is not a joke. Please  read 
- it definitely is a serious threat to our lives and 
health. This  is an alert about a virus in the original 
sense of the word...... one that  affects your 
body.....not your hard drive. There have been 23 
confirmed  cases of people attacked by the Klingerman 
Virus, a virus that arrives in  your real mailbox, not 
in your e-mail inbox. 
Someone has been  mailing large blue envelopes, 
seemingly at random, to people in the U.S. and  Canada. 
On the front of the envelope in bold black letters is 
printed  " A Gift For You From The Klingerman 
Foundation". 
When the  envelopes are opened, there is a small sponge 
sealed in plastic.  This  sponge carries what has come 
to be known as the Klingerman Virus and public  health 
officials state this is a strain of virus they have 
not  
previously encountered. Those who have come in contact 
with the  Klingerman Virus have been hospitalized with 
severe dysentery. So far seven  of the twenty-three 
victims have died. There is no legitimate 
Klingerman  Foundation, mailing unsolicited gifts. 
If you receive an oversized blue  envelope in the 
mail marked "A Gift For You From The Klingerman  
Foundation".      Do not open it !!!!! 
Place it  in a strong plastic bag or container & call 
the police immediately. The  "gift" is one you 
definitely do not want to open. 
PLEASE  PASS THIS ON TO EVERYONE THAT YOU CARE ABOUT  
                                                                                     Vaughn  Hicks
