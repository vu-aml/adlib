Rod,
 
Please remind the Enron Wind folks that all accounts should be set up in coordination with the Treasury group.  Clearly, much of the proceeds here will not be comingled with Enron funds, but we still need to adhere to Enron's board policy.  Thanks.

Ray

Ray, 
I understand that Enron Wind opened an account on their own to hold the proceeds of the sale of Indian Mesa and Clear Sky.  Enron was not involved in this opening.  I'd like to open an account and move funds into compliance.  Do you agree?
