of security updates. Many of the security notifications come from the
[2]Month of PHP Bugs effort, and range from double freed memory to bugs
in functions that allow attackers to enable register_globals, to memory
corruption with unserialize(), to input validation flaws that allow
e-mail header injections, with an unhealthy sprinkling of other bugs and
flaws fixed. All administrators that run any version of PHP are
encouraged to update immediately."

The New York Times reports that [0]schools are abandoning their
laptops-for-students programs. It turns out that the expense of providing
laptops, expense of repairing laptops, difficulties of school network
management, and discipline problems stemming from pornography, cheating,
and cracking more than outweighed the educational benefits. Indeed, a
number of schools have concluded that far from improving student
achievement, laptops either had no effect or actively hindered academic
performance. Apparently, politicians embracing technology as a quick fix
for social problems doesn't always work out.

SteakNShake writes "Once again professional [0]astronomers are struggling
to understand observations of the sun. ScienceDaily reports that a team
from Saint Andrew's University announced that [1]the sun's magnetic
fields dominate the behavior of the corona via a mechanism dubbed the
'solar skeleton.' Computer models continue to be built to mimic the
observed behavior of the sun in terms of magnetic fields but apparently
the ball is still being dropped; no mention in the announcement is made
of the electric fields that must be the cause of the observed magnetic
fields. Also conspicuously absent from the press releases is the
conclusion that the sun's corona is so-dominated by electric and magnetic
fields because it is a plasma. In light of past and present [2]research
revealing the electrical nature of the universe, this kind of crippling
ignorance among professional astrophysicists is astonishing."

15 judges of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals have unanimously
[0]reversed dismissal of a RICO class action suit against Microsoft and
Best Buy, which claims the companies engaged in fraud in promoting
Microsoft's MSN online service. ([1]RICO is a statute originally intended
to help prosecutors go after organized crime.) Quoting: "The case started
after James Odom bought a PC-based laptop at a Contra Costa County Best
Buy store. Data about the purchase was sent to Microsoft as part of a
joint marketing agreement between the companies. Microsoft then signed
Mr. Odom up for its MSN Internet service and, after a free trial period,
began billing him for it." Howard Bashman's How Appealing blog has
[2]more details on the reversal, including a paraphrase from one of the
appellate judges that "all blame rests with the U.S. Supreme Court for
allowing the 'outlandish' result that a claim such as this can be pursued
under RICO."

An anonymous reader sends us to the Wall Street Journal for a detailed
report on [0]what is known to date about the TJX data breach. It seems
that the loss of over 45 million credit card numbers and more than
450,000 SSNs, driver's license numbers, and military identifications
began with someone using a "telescope-shaped" antenna at a wireless link
at a Marshall's near St. Paul, Minnesota in July 2005. The link was
encrypted using WEP, which had been [1]known to be broken since 2001. The
crackers who got into the TJX central databases are believed to be
Romanians or Russians with ties to the Russian mobs. The eventual cost of
the TXJ fiasco could exceed $1 billion — not including the numerous
lawsuits filed against the retailer.

John Siracusa writes a brief article at Ars Technica pointing out an
exchange between Andrew Morton, a lead developer of the Linux kernel, and
a ZFS developer. Morton accused ZFS of being a "rampant layering
violation." Siracusa states that this [0]attitude of refusing to think
holistically ("across layers") is responsible for all of the current
failings of Linux — desktop adoption, user-friendliness, consumer
software, and gaming. ZFS is effective because it crosses the lines set
by conventional wisdom. Siracusa ultimately believes that the ability to
achieve such a break is more likely to emerge within an authoritative,
top-down organization than from a grass-roots, fractious community such
as Linux.
