        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Strat 
        Petroleum, Ltd. (the "Company") was the result of a reverse takeover of 
        F2 Broadcast Network, Inc. which was organized under the laws of the 
        State of Nevada, to acquire licenses to develop oil and gas properties 
        in the Russian Federation. The Company redomesticated to Wyoming on July 
        9,2004 Management intends, during the next six to twelve month period, 
        to acquire interests in licenses for oil and gas properties that have 
        proven reserves and where possible capped or producing wells.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><i><b>Proposed Business</b></i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        Company has entered into a Memorandum of<br>
        Understanding to acquire 49% of a license in a property in the Region of 
        Orenburg called the Rozhdestvenskoe Oil Site.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><i><b>Company Direction & Vision</b></i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Strat 
        Petroleum's envisions building a strong vertically integrated petroleum 
        company based on opportunities available in the Russian Federation and 
        neighboring countries. This will be accomplished through acquisitions of 
        interests in licenses to develop crude oil sites with proven reserves, 
        an equity investment in one or more refineries, and through the sale of 
        refined products secured from a number of refineries with which the<br>
        Company has very strong contact.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><i><b>The Opportunity</b></i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        Company stands to acquire interests in licenses to explore and develop 
        oil and gas properties in the Russian Federation. The Company's 
        management and advisory team have developed a very strong network of 
        contacts within the various levels of government, banks and independent 
        associations in the local oil and gas industry, which we believe will 
        provide access to many opportunities to bring value to shareholders.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        Company has currently signed a memorandum of understanding to secure a 
        49.0 percent interest in a field in the Orenburg Region with proven 
        reserves of at least 70 million barrels of oil, based upon reserve 
        reports filed with Gazprom.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        Company initially will be targeting acquisition of interests in licenses 
        to properties with proven reserves and where possible with commercially 
        producing or capped wells, i.e. focusing on development and not 
        exploration.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        Company has also established contacts with a number of refineries that 
        will allow it to have access to refined products for sale into 
        international markets. All product sales will be in U.S. dollars and may 
        be sold to both international and local customers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><b><i>The Region of Orenburg</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        initial opportunity is the right to acquire a working interest in one or 
        more oil and gas fields in the Region of Orenburg, Russia, which is 
        located in the Urals of Western Siberia.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Urals 
        and Western Siberia are home to Russia's leading producers of oil and 
        gas. This region represents a major potential market for U.S. companies 
        interested in sales and medium to long-term investment in the petroleum 
        industry. The oil and gas sector in the Urals and western Siberia 
        possesses major advantages, which include not only its enormous 
        prospected oil and gas resources, but the proximity of deposits to oil<br>
        extraction equipment suppliers, and to the European market.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Orenburg 
        Oblast (Province) is also a leading oil and gas producer. Exploration 
        has revealed over 140 oil and gas deposits. Proven reserves of oil 
        exceed 127.4 million<br>
        metric tons, while gas estimates are 821.1 billion cubic meters. The 
        region has an estimated 40 to 50 years of commercially exploitable 
        natural gas reserves. Orenburg<br>
        currently produces between 8.4 and 8.5 million metric tons of oil. 
        [Barrels is the commonly understood measure.] However, substantial 
        investment is required in order to further develop the region's oil and 
        gas extraction industries.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Only 
        about 1% of proven reserves have been extracted which not only leaves 
        significant quantities yet to be extracted but large tracts of land 
        still untested.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><b><i>Russia's Oil Industry</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New 
        Russia has had two major and paradoxical effects on the oil industry: 
        production has dropped sharply but the industry's importance in terms of 
        the foreign currency it earns has risen dramatically.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At its 
        peak, the Soviet oil industry produced over 11 million barrels of crude 
        oil per day (mbd) in 1987 - that was more than Saudi Arabia, more than 
        every other country in the world in fact except the United States and 
        over a sixth of total world production.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1995, 
        production was about 6 mbd - a reduction of almost half from the 12.5 
        mbd achieved in 1988. The reduction in production has several reasons; 
        most significantly is the decline in the massive infrastructure needed 
        to keep the oil fields operational. Many<br>
        Soviet oil fields were thousands of kilometers away from their markets 
        and thousands of kilometers inland, in Siberia or Central Asia. The 
        industry needed massive maintenance for pipeline systems and machinery.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Partly it 
        was an effect of political chaos. In Soviet days, the strong machinery 
        of the state had ensured that an industry like oil, vital for the whole 
        economy, was kept running no matter what. Once central control was 
        weakened, Russia's captains of industry started competing among 
        themselves for resources, and oil could not be guaranteed primacy.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That 
        Russia has substantial reserves of oil is old news. What is new is the 
        dramatically enhanced role in Russian politics, oil technology, and 
        energy markets have given to its petroleum sector. Throughout the 
        1990's, privatization in Russia and innovations in exploration and 
        drilling technologies brought into production oil fields that had until 
        then been underperforming or completely off-limits, has resulted in 
        increased production to<br>
        8.2 mbd in 2003.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To energy 
        companies worried about growing domestic instability among the major oil 
        exporters of the Middle East, Russia has become an even more attractive 
        hedge. Regardless of its political turmoil, Russia will continue to 
        appeal to oil companies, which know how to operate profitably in 
        countries with weak property rights and unstable politics.</font></td>

                    involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may
                    cause a company's actual results in the future periods to
                    differ materially from forecasted results. These risks and
                    uncertainties include, among other things, product price
                    volatility, product demand, market competition and risk
                    inherent in the companies operations. You can identify these
                    statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to
                    historical or current facts. They use words such as
                    ``anticipate,'' ``estimate,'' ``expect,'' ``project,''
                    ``intend,'' ``plan,", "anticipate",
                    "guess", "think", "hear",
                    "suggest", ``believe,'' and other words and terms
                    of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of
                    future operating or financial performance.</span><font face="Arial"><o:p>

                    bulletin board, especially if the investment involves a

                    said Nancy M. Smith, Director of SEC's Office of Investor
