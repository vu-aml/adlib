I'm on it.

I have the Fax and Printers stashed away.  I just need to move them up and plug them in.  I'll get that done by close of business.

Lance,

I just walked the floors to check out our data rooms and noticed the following:

1.  Area 2991-2993 - we only have one telephone.  Can we get another installed?  There was no indication of where the portal was for the laptop (a yellow sticky that says "portal here!").  The fax machine is low on toner.  How can we locate toner at this late date to fit that fax machine?  

The three remaining areas still need their fax, printers and portals...

The fourth area 2945-2947, Room 2946 does not have a working phone.  

Esmeralda, what is the status of our coffee thermos's, coffee cups, sugar, creamer, office supplies?  I noticed the printer in 2993 was low on paper.  Can we get some printer paper brought down.  The conference room on 33 needs the coffee thermos's and ice bucket rinsed out, they've got old stuff in them.  Rooms 2945 & 2946 need to be straighted up a bit.  Can you take a look at this...or do you want to go down together...

Lance & Esmeralda, I am attaching a list of the current Data Rooms for your assistance:

Lance,

I just spoke to Mary Cook and she would like all four areas done by the end of today.  Is that doable?

					Tana, 

					The suite of offices on 29 will be complete with a fax machine and an additional analog line for P.C. dial-up access by close of business today.  The only exception to your requirements is for an additional table in the empty room.  I believe that will be in by mid day tomorrow.

					We will prepare 32 Thursday.
