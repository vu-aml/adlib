Just wanted to pass along some names and numbers of contractors with 
which we have had recent success:

1) we recently had a small shed torn down at the back of our property 
(I am sure all of our neighbors cheered the removal of that 
eyesore!).  It was a bit of a challenge to find a demolition company 
that could work in such a small area, but ultimately we found the man 
for the job.  His name is Roger Robichau, and generally he does 
concrete removal, but will also do tear downs like ours (which 
consisted of removal of a tree and a fence as well).  He was right 
out to give us a quote, which was very reasonable, and he did a good 
job.  No complaints at all.  His cell # is 713-823-0204, and his 
pager is 713-788-3784.

2) the fence that was torn down was replaced by a company called 
Decks for Less, owned by Jimmy Turner.  They beat out the larger 
companies (likely because they could be more competitive on this 
small job - the big guys were hitting us with the "minimum charge").  
He came out right away, and had the fence up (50') in a day.  Again, 
very reasonable, and very tidy - I have hardly found any overlooked 
screws or nails, which is a big bonus with a little one running 
around the back yard.  His number is 713-499-1560.

3) late this past fall, we had a wrought iron fence and driveway gate 
installed by AA Ornamental, owned by Calvin Raley.  They did a good 
job, their price was very competitive, and a big plus - as the fence 
has shifted and settled, he has come back out to make adjustments.  
No problem at all getting him to follow up.  He has also done the 
fence installation around the new townhomes at the corner of Welch 
and Morgan, if you want to see other examples of his work (that one 
is more elaborate than ours - take a look at the back of the property 
to see the "creative stuff".  His numer is 281-354-2659.
