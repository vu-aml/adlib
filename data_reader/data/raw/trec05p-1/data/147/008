Latest NFL Player News

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/24/01
Davis is scheduled to return against the Miami Dolphins on Dec. 2. He has missed the past two games while recovering from his second arthroscopic surgery this year. 

Olandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=133291&>, RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/24/01
Gary will be out for the rest of the season. He broke a bone in his left leg during Thursday's game. 

Darnay Scott <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&! ow! ner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1212&>, WR CIN - JWillie Updated 11/23/01
Scott has been listed as questionable for Sunday's game at Cleveland due to a rib injury. He is expected to miss the game, however, so be sure to put him on reserve this week. 

James Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1820&>, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
With Anthony Thomas ailing, Allen will likely start Sunday's game against Minnesota. Considering the Vikings lack of a solid run defense, Allen would be a good Fantasy start in Week 11. 

Anthony Thomas <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin! Updated 11/23/01
According to publised reports, Thomas has been listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Thomas is nursing a hamstring injury, and will likely be replaced in the starting lineup by James Allen. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/23/01
Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He gained only nine yards on nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for most of the second half. 

Damon Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
The Jacksonvil! le! Jaguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list Thursday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught just eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury. 

James Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/23/01
Stewart rushed for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game early with a stinger in his neck. He had missed the previous four games with a sprained right ankle, and is now listed as day to day. 

Charlie Batch <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
Batch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdowns, an interception and a fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series in the first half, replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch said he couldn't plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His status for next week's game is uncertain. 

Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
Banks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at Denver, returned to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution, but all his postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks in the 17-10 victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback. 

Rod Smith <http://footba! ll! 222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/23/01
Smith had seven catches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained ankle. He also went over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith might be the best receiver in football and is a must start every week. 

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/23/01
Davis could be back next week at Miami. He has missed the last two games because of a torn meniscus.

Olandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=133291&> , RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/23/01
Gary broke a bone in his left leg on the second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for the rest of the season. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrell Davis might be able to return next week. 

Jeff Graham <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass.

Jerome Bettis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 11/21/01
The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone.

Curtis Conway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 11/21/01
Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long.

Kordell Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1054&>, QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.

Darrell Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 11/21/01
Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.

Tim Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/21/01
Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week.

Charlie Garner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 11/21/01
Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.

David Patten <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1790&>, WR NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01
Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.

Troy Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01
Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.

Antowain Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01
Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 11/21/01
Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season.

James McKnight <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues.

Travis Minor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=235123&>, RB MIA - Giggles Updated 11/21/01
The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.

Tony Gonzalez <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 11/21/01
Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewhat of ! a ! disappointment, you need to keep him active every week.

Stephen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01
Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around the league. 

Larry Parker <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=133384&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.

Tony Richardson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1471&>, RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 11/21/01
Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.
