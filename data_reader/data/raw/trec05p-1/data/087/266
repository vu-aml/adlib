Tim Belden and I are pleased to announce that Jim Buerkle, Chris Lackey and John Van Gelder are joining the Middle Market Group.  The Middle Market Group will continue to focus on commodity marketing throughout the WSCC under the leadership of Stewart Rosman, Paul Choi and John Malowney.  This group will report to me to enable closer coordination and integration with our Origination group and to ensure that Enron has complete and seamless coverage of the power market.   Chris Foster will continue to lead our growing services business and report to Tim.  

Please join me in congratulating Jim, Chris and John on their new roles.

Chris Calger
