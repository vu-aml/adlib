Sorry for another spam.  I promise this all the input that I will request on
Raiders Game.

We do have a third choice of 12/22 (vs. Tennessee) if you prefer.  Let me
know.

Thanks,
Tony

Tony: I am not here on 11/18 and I doubt I will go for the 12/2 game as I
will be trying to catch-up after missing 2 weeks of classes. My vote goes
for the 12/22 game against Tennessee. May be you should put that as the 3rd
choice now that you are taking input from everyone.

Hello everyone,

We have a small dilemma on the Raiders Game schedule.  The original schedule
was Nov 18 (vs. Chargers), but our HAAS contact indicated that it's going to
be tough to get block tickets for that day.  We are still trying to get
tickets for that day.  Our other alternative is to have the game on 12/2
(vs. Cardinals).  However, the finals will start in the following week on
12/10.  12/2 game maybe cutting a little close to our final schedule.

I need your input to gauge the interest level for either game.  Please send
me a quick email if you are interested in going, and which date (12/2 or
11/18) do you prefer.  Based on your input, we will finalize our Raiders
Game schedule.

Thanks,
Tony
