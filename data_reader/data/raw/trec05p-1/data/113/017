hi jon- thanks for speaking to danny at global..
we put this chart together everyday and its been the basis of the short tz6 trade..

we have not included taxes in the fuel numbers.. even when you add 50 cents to fuel and heat for jan and feb.. gas is way over at tz6..

you mentioned basis there getting out to $3.00 plus when we actually have some cold.. what is that based on? 

thnx,
ca
