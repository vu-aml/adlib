OLD OAKEN BUCKET GAME THIS SATURDAY - IU and Purdue square off for their
104th meeting and the 77th battle for the Old Oaken Bucket, making it one
of the country's most storied football rivalries. IU had its hopes for a
bowl game dashed this past week at Penn State as the Hoosiers fell to the
Nittany Lions, 28-14, despite 366 total yards from Heisman Trophy
candidate Antwaan Randle El. They hope to finish the season strong with
wins against Purdue and Kentucky.
