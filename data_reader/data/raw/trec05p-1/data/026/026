Dear Client,

Today is a new day for your residence. With levels 
at their headline-making historic lows, our programs 
are better now than ever before. Even if you've recently 
closed on a property, now is the time to check your 
numbers.

Our advisors are here to help you decide your options.
In fact, did you know that a 30 year fixed program may 
not always be the best option? 

There are other ways to do it, and we would like to tell 
you about it.

Find out what all your neighbors are talking about.

Sincerely,
Your Lending Specialist.
