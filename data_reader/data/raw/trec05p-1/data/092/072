On Friday night, routine hardware maintenance was started on the Project Sunrise Financial Data Warehouse.  The work was scheduled to complete on Sunday, but problems were encountered with a bad memory board on the database server.  The vendor was called and replacement hardware was delivered and installed on Sunday.  The restore is currently running and is scheduled to complete around 5:30 pm today (Monday).  If the estimated completion time changes, we will update you.

We apologize for any inconvenience this causes.
