Stephanie,

As discussed, attached below is the revised credit worksheet for Copamex (for the threshold matrix).  However, please note that the Enron Corp. gty already sent to Copamex for $15MM will remain active and tied to this ISDA (disregard the $20MM gty in the worksheet).

Thanks--Veronica

Francisco,

Per my message, attached is a newly revised worksheet that should meet our credit needs.  


Jaime--if the counterparty continues to dispute, we need to receive audited year end 2000 financials and 2001 quarterly financial position reports to reevaluate.


Thanks,

Veronica
