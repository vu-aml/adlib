Michelle,

Our Coal group is planning to close an office we have in WV at the end of this year.  There are 4 employees in this location; one has been offered a job in Houston and has declined, another employee may be offered a job with a JV we have nearby.

I wanted to see if there are any notification requirements in WV and if so, what they are.

Thanks,
Shanna
