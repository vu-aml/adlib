NFL Reports, Player Updates

Latest NFL Player News

Rob Moore <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 12/02/01
Moore was placed on injured reserve by the Arizona Cardinals this weekend, effectively ending his season. Moore, who hasn't played a game this year due to a hamstring injury, could be coming to the end of his career. 

James Allen <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1820&>, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Allen will be the likely starter on Sunday against Detroit. Rookie Anthony Thomas is listed as a gametime decision due to a hamstring injury, but you'd have to bel! ie! ve that coach Dick Jauron wants to get him has healthy as possible for the team's upcoming playoff run. If Allen does in fact start, he's a good play for Fantasy owners in Week 12 against a weak Detroit defense. 

Anthony Thomas <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 12/02/01
Thomas (hamstring) missed practice on Friday and is listed as a gametime decision against Detroit. Considering that Chicago is in the playoff hunt and is playing a team that's 0-10, don't be surprised if coach Dick Jauron gives Thomas another week off in order to get healthy. 

Anthony Thomas <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 12/01/01
Thomas missed Friday's practice due to a strained hamstring, and remains a gametime decision. James Allen would get the start in his place, and we recommend you wait until a final decision is reached before you opt to use either back this week.

Raghib Ismail <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/01/01
Ismail is expected to play Sunday against Washington despite a concussion he suffered this week. He's still not a recommended starter this week.

Tai Streets <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=133425&>, WR SF - Free Agent Updated 12/01/01
Stree! ts! was added to the injury report as probable for Sunday's game against Buffalo due to a minor hamstring injury. He would likely start in place of Terrell Owens if the latter is unable to play. Streets is a marginal starter to begin with, and only if Owens is clearly not going to play.

Jimmy Kleinsasser <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=133340&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/01/01
Kleinsasser will not play Sunday against Pittsburgh and could miss a few more games due to a high ankle sprain, according to published reports. He isn't much of a Fantasy factor to begin with, so this news probably doesn't affect your lineup decisions this week.

Daunte ! Cu! lpepper <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=133263&> , QB MIN - Giggles Updated 12/01/01
According to published reports, Culpepper practiced on Friday despite a knee injury. He is expected to start Sunday's game against Pittsburgh, but will be only about 70 percent healthy and will have severely limited mobility in the game. Culpepper is a very risky start this week, so don't use him unless you don't have a viable alternative.

Cameron Cleeland <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=12277&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/01/01
Cleeland practiced with the scout team on Friday despite an ankle injury, according to published reports. However, he is not expected to play Sunday, so expect Boo Williams to start at tight end once again. Use Williams and not Cleeland this week.
Frank Sanders <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/01/01
Sanders will travel with the Cardinals for Sunday's game against Oakland despite a hamstring, according to published reports. However, he is a gametime decision, so hold off on using him this week.

David Sloan <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1331&>, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 12/01/01
According to published reports, Sloan said Friday that he has a slight tear of the medial collateral ligament in his knee. He has not been able to practice all week and most likely will not play Sunday against Chicago. Keep Sloan on your bench this week.! 

Terrell Owens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 12/01/01
Owens was able to practice Friday for the first time this week due to foot and ankle sprains, according to the Contra Costa Times. He will be re-evaluated Saturday to see if he has any lingering stiffness, and remains questionable for Sunday's game against Buffalo. If Owens does not play, he would only miss one week, according to Head Coach Steve Mariucci. Unless it becomes clear he will play before you need to make a lineup decision, you should probably reserve him for this week.

Kevan Barlow <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 12/01/01
Barlow missed Friday's practice due to a shoulder injury, according to the Contra Costa Times. He is unlikely to play Sunday against Buffalo, and you shouldn't use him this week as a result.

Kevin Dyson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=12342&>, WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 11/30/01
Dyson is recovering from a toe injury, but is expected to play Sunday. He is listed as questionable. Don't look for good numbers from Dyson this week. The injury will likely slow him down a bit. 

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 11/30/01
Even though George's stats have been on the decline it will be hard to find a better running back on waivers. George has struggled recently but is still a must-start every week. 

Frank Wycheck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/30/01
Wycheck, still suffering from an ankle injury is expected to play in Sunday's game. However, he is listed as questionable. Don't expect him to be too productive. 

Hines Ward <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 11/30/01
Ward doesn't score often, but has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year. He will always pos! t ! respectable totals so keep him in your lineup every week. 

Kyle Brady <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1356&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. Don't expect him to be too productive. Check and see if there is a more productive tight end on the waiver wires before settling on him. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Frank Updated 11/30/01
Despite his recent troubles off the field, Smith is still one of the best receivers. Look for him to catch some passes this week and be a solid No. 2 wideout. 

Tim Couch <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=133260&>, QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Couch has been solid this season despite the lack of a solid No. 2 wideout. He will be a good pickup if you are looking for starting QB. 

Quincy Morgan <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=235232&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Morgan might regain his starting job this week, but don't expect him to be too productive. He has only caught 22 passes this season, two of which are TDs. 

Darnay Scott!  <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1212&>, WR CIN - JWillie Updated 11/30/01
Don't expect Scott to be too productive this week. He only has two TD catches this season. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Expect Grbac to have a solid game this week against the Colts. Indianapolis has allowed 17 TD passes this season. 

Travis Taylor <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=187399&>, WR BAL - Russell Updated 11/30/01
Taylor has been unproductive this season. However, he could experience some success this week against a shaky Colts defense. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 11/30/01
Hasselbeck has been playing well in recent weeks, but he isn't putting up great Fantasy numbers. He is looked upon to avoid mistakes, not to win games for Seattle. As a result, Hasselbeck isn't worth more than a reserve role on your Fantasy team. 

Darrell Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 11/30/01
Jackson has been playing well in recent weeks, and he should have another good week against San Diego. The Chargers pass defense has been in question in recent weeks, so starting Jackson in deeper leagues is ! ad! visable. 

Charlie Garner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 11/30/01
Garner is a must-start against Arizona in Week 12. He faces a great matchup against the Cardinals, who have one of the worst defenses in the entire league. 

Jerry Rice <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1291&>, WR OAK - Neal/McKay Updated 11/30/01
Rice still has plenty of life in his 39 year old legs, and he'll prove it on Sunday against Arizona. The Cards are one of the worst teams in the league against the pass, so starting Rice in Week 12 is advisable. 

Tim Brown <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/30/01
Brown should have a field day against Arizona on Sunday. The Cardinals secondary is very vulnerable to solid passing teams, so look for the veteran wideout to have a big day. 

Tom Brady <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=187741&>, QB NE - Martin Updated 11/30/01
Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, so starting him in Week 12 is a wise move.
