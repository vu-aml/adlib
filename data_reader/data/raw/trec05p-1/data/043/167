SVMG Energy Committee Members:

This e-mail serves as a reminder for our next Energy Committee meeting,
scheduled for tomorrow, Wednesday, September 5th from 3:00 to 5:00pm.  We
will be hosted by AMD located at One AMD Place in Sunnyvale.

The National Energy Policy Development Group recently issued recommendations
related to improving the nation’s transmission grid, as part of its’
“America’s Energy Infrastructure” report.  The I-Grid, developed by
SoftSwitching Technologies, offers a unique, synergistic opportunity for the
private sector, utilities and the federal government to work together
towards realizing some of the objectives set forth in the report.  Please
read the attached briefing document in preparation for tomorrow's
presentation on transmission grid improvement opportunities specifically for
Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group member companies.

If you have yet to confirm your participation at this meeting, please do so
by responding to this e-mail or calling 408-501-7870.  Thanks.
