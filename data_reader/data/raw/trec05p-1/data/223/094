Cornbelt called and said they have an outage on Friday the 8th. They would like for us to limit Hubbard to 4000 hp from 9am to 16pm. Pierre will go out and put the limits into the program. Also, all the Waterloo units are available, however, if unit # 6 is needed they need to balance the power cylinders.
