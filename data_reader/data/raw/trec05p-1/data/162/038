In short, if the carrier pays out anything, they hold subrogation rights; however, the longer answer is much more complicated, of course. Please feel free to call Eileen (37535) or me and we will be glad to discuss further.

If the carrier pays to settle the case on behalf of the directors or officers does it thereby gain any subrogation rights against any third parties.  For example, would it mean the carrier, and not the company, would own the cause of action against AA?
