Steffes and I were just chatting and an idea came up, that we try to offer our El Paso capacity to PG&E in their bankruptcy suit (in which a settlement is being negotiated) and perhaps we can, in turn, reduce our claim against PG&E in that case.  Maybe this is already being done, but if not, it is a thought.  Lisa Mellencamp and Michael Tribolet are doing the bankruptcy case.
