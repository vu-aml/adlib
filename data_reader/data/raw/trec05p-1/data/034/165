Jeff:
Sorry for the delay. Lari is selling because she wants to spend more
time with family, her horses and friends. You knew that she and Harvey
got married earlier this year? Yes, they tied the knot on horseback. No,
Rob and I are not married. This time it is his fault. Just teasing. We
will have been dating 5 years in September! How are you and Prentice?
Please let me know what is up on your end. 

We only have a few more weeks before the stables close. It is really
sad. I treasure every moment out there. I love riding through the
park--especially when it is quite. You feel like you are in a different
world.

You can count on staying with us if you go to Mendocino. Please come
with us! It will probably be our last time with Lari and the old gang. 
Big Hugs--miss you,
Madeleine

Jeff-Great to hear from you. What is up on your end besides your
scheduling falling apart?

We are riding the 22nd and 23rd. You may know that Lari is selling RRR.
We can talk about it later-she will ride with us though and act as a
consultant in the future.

All is going great on my end--cantered Bentley through the park
yesterday and on the polo field track. It was an absolute blast--one of
the funnest rides I've ever had in the park. He's making great progress
at staying calm! Rob and I are off to Hawaii next week. My business is
great despite our favorite sector crashing before our very eyes. The
VC's are really quiet right now...

I hope you can join us in Mendocino. We may have an extra place to crash
in our room. 
Big Hugs--
Madeleine

Hey gang--
I couldn't convince Rob to join us... boo hoo. Jeff Walker and I are
confirmed. We will be sharing a room but since many of the rooms/suites
are so large anyone else is more than welcome to join us. I will be
organizing the room today and will probably book a large one should one
of you want to join us. Here are the ones I am considering. Let me know
what you think.  The web site to view the rooms is

Hello all,
 
I made a reservation at Cleone Gardens Inn, just across the street from
the ranch.  I reserved a room for Pat, Cal and myself, but was unsure
what other reservations to make for the rest of the group because some
of you are still tentative and I'm not sure who is bringing SOs/dates.  
 
The inn has one room called the Blue Iris room with two double beds that
might work for Jeff W. and Jeff D. if going up single; most of their
other rooms have a queen or king bed (the Meadow View king room sounded
nice for a couple if we have any going up).  Both of those are still
available for the weekend we are planning to be there.  I think there
may be some cottages available also for multiple people, but I'm not
sure what the configurations of those are.  A full breakfast can be
ordered from some of the rooms for $14.00 extra.  They serve breakfast
at 8:00 a.m.  Pat, Cal and I have a suite with a small kitchen, so we
may also be able to host some minimal meals/snacks/drinks.  
 
The phone number of Cleone Gardens is 1-800-400-2189.  Their website,
which has pictures and descriptions of their rooms, is
cleonegardensinn.com.  If the Cleone Gardens Inn does not have the room
configuration you want, Lari's website (horse-vacations.com) has links
to numerous other hotels and B&Bs.
 
Tally ho!
 
Amy

Hi All: 

Madeleine was kind about me not keeping up with personal emails .... 


I am putting the Mendocino dates on my calendar. I would like to ride
both days. I would also like to stay where everyone will be happiest ;) 
Howard's Creek is great, but I agree with Pat, that we just won't have
the time to enjoy the place (or breakfast). 

BTW - Are any non-riders coming?? 

Jeff.
