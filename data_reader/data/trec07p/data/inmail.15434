I'm not making such a distinction. The actual location in which the
license is distributed does not matter. All that matters is that it is
a license being used as a legal document under which a work in Debian
is being distributed. It cannot be a license whose removal or
abridgement would have no legal effect upon the work in which it is
distributed. [I would argue as well that its removal cannot have a
functional effect on the work either.]
