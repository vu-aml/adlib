Dear eric,




ROCKETS 5-GAME OUTLOOK 

The Rockets kick off a four-game West Coast road trip tonight in Sacramento. Other stops include Portland (Tuesday), Seattle (Friday) and L.A. to take on the Clippers (Sunday). Houston will then return home Tuesday, November 27 to host the Kings.

Or details about the next five games, check out the Rockets 5-Game Outlook (http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=134695&UID=45456540&MID=188637). 

 

ROCKETS ACTIVATE DAN LANGHI

The Houston Rockets have placed guard Tierre Brown on the injured list with plantar fasciitis of the left foot, General Manager Carroll Dawson has announced. In a related move, the Rockets activated forward Dan Langhi from the injured list.

Brown has seen action in one regular season game, recording two points and three assists while making his NBA debut at Denver on Nov. 9. The 6-foot-2, 189-pound rookie averaged 4.0 points and 2.3 assists for Houston in four preseason games. The McNeese State product received All-Southland Conference honors following each of the last two college basketball seasons.

Langhi has been sidelined for Houston's first nine games with a right ankle sprain. The 6-foot-11, 22-0 pound forward averaged 5.8 points and 1.8 rebounds in five Rockets preseason games. Langhi averaged 2.7 points and 1.2 rebounds as a rookie last year after being named the 2000 Southeastern Conference Player of the Year with Vanderbilt the previous season.

MO' BETTA BUNCH

Houston Rockets forward Maurice Taylor (http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=134697&UID=45456540&MID=188637) has purchased 40 regular season tickets and will donate all of the seats to local non-profit community groups that serve underprivileged children. Taylor plans to make the Rockets home game seats available to the community groups throughout the remainder of the 2001-2002 NBA season. Appropriately dubbed the "Mo'Betta Bunch," Taylor's charitable endeavor will touch the lives of
more than 1,400 children in the Houston area. 

Each "Mo' Betta Bunch" group attending a Rockets home game will receive reserved seating in Compaq Center, designated with a special, brightly colored banner, and an exclusive, red T-shirt sporting Taylor's name and Rockets jersey number. Schedule permitting, Taylor intends to personally welcome each "Mo' Betta Bunch" group to the game prior to tipoff.

"I am very pleased to have the opportunity to help our deserving youth and provide a Rockets game experience," said Taylor. "Having the ability to touch so many young lives and make a positive impact is truly rewarding."

The Rockets Community Services Department will be responsible for selection of groups to participate in "Mo' Betta Bunch" and the distribution of tickets and T-shirts. 

The goal of Taylor's ticket donation program is to help non-profit groups who are already making a difference in the lives of children, but who lack the finances to provide extra-curricular activities.
