vision is pretty blurry, but will clear up a little bit every day.  I can't see through my glasses anymore because they have a correction.  He wants me to wait at least 6 weeks before deciding the strength of any correction.  I have to see him again in a couple of weeks.  I  can actually see better in the right eye than I could in the left after they did that one, but we did the worst one first, so that is probably why.  Anyway, all is well.  I'm staying in today but hope to get out some tomorrow and Sunday and Monday, of course. 
 
Hope you both have a wonderful weekend.
