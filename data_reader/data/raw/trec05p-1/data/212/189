John,Kam,

We can inactivate these books enmasse in risktrac to start with. The position capture jobs will flip them to active if a position comes in on it.
Please just confirm this and we will make it inactive.

FYI - The books are already created in Erms (Netco) and we don't have a field to activate or inactivate books.  Please advise the users not to use the inactive books.

Thanks,
Cecilia

	Attached you will find the new books that have been set up for UBS Energy.  There are some books that do not have a trader name attached.  These books will be inactive until a trader is assigned at a later date.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

	John
