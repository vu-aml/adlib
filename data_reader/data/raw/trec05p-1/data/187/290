Hey Bass, what's up? I hope you had a nice Christmas/New Year's.  So, what
does second place pay? and what do I owe for that other league? and I owe
you $40 (20 for the Auburn LSU tickets, and 20 for Texas ending up higher in
the polls than LSU, I'll admit that bet was a lot closer than I thought it
would be at the end of the season, Geaux Tigers!!) So let me know if I still
have any money coming to me or if I'm in the red. Take it easy,
Bryan
