Dennis -

Thanx for the laughs!  Not many around here, these days...but things are
looking up with the trip tomorrow on tap.

"New Look"?  Last time you introduced a new look, Gillette equities went
through the roof.  Do I need to buy some stock in Nair or Neet, now?  You'll
be quite the hit at the Aquatorium, or the Natatasium, or the cement pond.
Will probably cut minutes off your lap time...and, no, I don't mean to
suggest that you're drinking directly from the pool.

We're up at 3 a.m. tomorrow to make it to IAH by 5.  Four-hour flight to
Newark, then a mere 17-hour jaunt over the Pole to HK, fortunately in the
front of the bus.

When he heard about the trip, one of my docs advised me to take an aspirin
before the flight.  I thought he was concerned about the prophylactic
treatment of a hangover from the free wine in first, but he said I should
thin my blood so we don't throw a clot from sitting in one place for too
long.  Oh.

Frankly, sometimes you can have too much information.

Glad to hear you're a part of the mbps crowd...broadband is best!  (unless
you are Enron Broadband)  Now you'll be able to download twice as much trash
in half the time...HOORAY!

If your Austin trip allows it, maybe we could meet you on neutral ground
(think Switzerland, or Chappell Hill) and have lunch.  Or you could take the
easterly leg and sail through Houston and drop in on your friends here.  You
could even meet the new cat and/or spend the night.  Tempting, isn't it?

Great news about Janell!  Maybe she'll be up to a trip in '03 (we're talking
about something special in August 2003 to coincide with our 20th
anniversary...think Edinburgh, London, Paris, two weeks).

Man, your connection is so fast, my fingers are getting all tied up trying
to stay ahead of your reading.

Gotta go.  See you on the other side of the International Date Line.

JW

Ah yes, my favorite topic [fast losing favor to the tales of Enron's
monarchy, I fear].  Here is an expansion of the "cow economics" tale that
includes ENE:


>Subject: Fw: economics lesson (from the TaxMan's Daughter

Thanx,
Dennis


PS - I am now zipping all of this info around on my new >1 mbaud link that I
finally shamed the cable company into getting hooked up [only took two
separate visits and plenty of customer "motivation"]  In tandem with my new
1.5ghz CPU, 80gb disk and CD burner, I believe I have moved us into the 20th
century [Alas, I know that everyone now agrees that you are in the 21st in
Houston].

Got the settlement on my old red buddy, but am still grieving and in a
quandry about what to do [no enthusiasm by either partner up here for
spending $$$ after the first year of Prince George's economic slide and the
Enron debacle].

Janell is now improving rapidly and we actually have a small jaunt planned
to Austin that looks very unlikely to be cancelled.  I have a new "look"
that I have been dying to spring on "the group" since before the Italia trip
was scrubbed.  It may be an old look [or gone] before we meet again.

I hope you get to see King Kong in hong Kong...isn't that where he lives??
