Thanks for the kind words, Jerilynn.

Regarding "toque blanche," I knew that a toque was the traditional brimless
chef's hat, but was unsure of the spelling.  Looking at my on-line
dictionary (www.m-w.com), I got the right spelling and found out that the
adjective "blanche" (white) was commonly appended.  So I added it, too.

I'll pass along your appreciation to Kim.

John

> Folks -
>
> Once again, the Gourmet Group had a wonderful outing, this time to Mark's
> American Cuisine.  For those of you who haven't been, Mark's is located in
a
> converted church at 1658 Westheimer.   Jerilynn and Tom Daugherty arranged
> the reservations and arrived first, joined shortly thereafter by Kim &
John
> Watson, Jim & Hattie McKinley, Jennifer Harvey & Jerry Granacki, and
fellow
> Ordinary Life class member and new group member Millie Hast.  We were
seated
> upstairs in what was once either the balcony or the choir loft.
>
> Our waiter, Lance, revealed that he was a medical student at UTMB in
> Galveston, and was astoundingly and persuasively well-informed about the
> restaurant and its wonderful offerings.  The menu, the "daily" menu and
the
> "off-menu" menu were replete with fabulous dishes, exquisitely prepared.
> Kim is still marvelling over the small dark round objects that had a
> delicate smoky taste, and of which her husband guessed were some sort of
> mushroom, only to discover that they were roasted baby brussell sprouts.
>
> After an appetizer selection that included a very light White Lobster
> Bisque, the second course arrived.  The Dover sole was very popular, as
was
> the "study in lamb."  No one was disappointed in the quality of their
> selections.  Dessert included selections such as Mom's Peanut Butter Cake,
> Chocolate Truffle Cheesecake, and Warm Chocolate Cake, all beautifully
> presented and delicately delicious.
>
> Mark's was a hit.  As Jerilynn put it, "We hate to come here too often
> because it is so special for us."  For more information about the
> restaurant, visit their web site at
> http://www.marks1658.com/
>
> Our next event is scheduled to be held at Tom & Jerilynn Daugherty's home
on
> Saturday, March 23.  The theme selected was French cooking, and Kim agreed
> to handle the recipe assignments.  So get your toque blanches ready and
> we'll wait with anticipation our next Gourmet Group outing!
