Treasury and Risk Management:
The Rocky Road to Corporate E-Trading 
Treasurers will drag their feet until straight-through processing arrives 
At the beginning of the year, corporate treasury departments were assured
that electronic trading was the promised land. Corporates were going to
capture big savings as banks and other sell-side institutions were forced,
by the simultaneous multiple quotes that e-trading makes possible, to offer
increasingly competitive pricing. Web sites offering corporates e-trading in
everything from foreign exchange to leasing began to spring up.

Corporate Finance:
FX Platforms Give Internal Control
Online FX platforms are moving to the next level with internal dealing
applications. Denise Bedell speaks to corporates looking at the new systems
and to the companies developing them to see how web-based trading
applications can increase control and auditing of the entire process of FX
risk management.

Events:
Many exciting eFX events have occurred over the past two months.  To
highlight a few:
In September, Currenex participated at the International Cash & Treasury
Management Conference in Madrid.   At the conference, Currenex's VP and EMEA
Managing Director, Roddy Boulton, discussed foreign exchange trading along
with a case study from Bert Kors, FX Manager, Sara Lee / DE n.v.  Currenex
also partnered with Trema to showcase straight-through-processing using an
interface developed jointly by Currenex and Trema. This interface allows
users of Finance Kit to automatically receive trade details from Currenex's
FXtrades multi-bank currency exchange via the Trema Transaction HUB Service.
This interface is based upon the TWIST standard, which both Trema and
Currenex have helped develop.  For more information, please go to:
http://www.currenex.com/html/pr_showcase.shtml or visit
www.twiststandards.org
Also in September, Currenex participated at the Treasury Management
Association of New York's Cash Exchange.  Currenex and Travelex discussed
the evolution of eFX.  Check out the media alert at
http://www.currenex.com/html/pr_travelex.shtml.  At the Eurofinance Pan
European conference in Atlanta, GA., Currenex and Home Depot participated in
a case study covering eFX and the benefits to using Currenex's service.
In October, Currenex participated at the Association for Financial
Professionals Conference in Chicago where we held two sessions and also
exhibited.  The opening remarks were from Madeline Albright who was
dynamite, and though she was busy, she did make the rounds and stopped by
the Currenex booth.  At the conference, Currenex partnered with Trema,
FXpress, Integrity, Simcorp and Wall Street Systems to demonstrate
straight-through-processing that is currently being delivered to several
Currenex members.  Ted Sanborn, VP Product Management of Currenex, held an
online foreign exchange trading workshop where participants learned about
how to get started in eFX.  And Jim Kleckner, EVP and CTO of Currenex,
conducted a session on Securities and Controls for Financial Transactions on
the Internet.  To view the AFP presentations, please visit the Currenex and
AFP partner page at http://www.currenex.com/afp.html  

We all expected that the Eurofinance Madrid and AFP conferences would be
somewhat dampened by the Sept 11th attacks; however, Currenex and its
partners, found the events to be extremely worthwhile, as both an exhibitor
and conference participant.

Special congratulations to Rebecca Flick, Director of Treasury, The Home
Depot on her promotion to AFP board Chair, and Currenex looks forward to
seeing all of you there next year in The Big Easy.....
