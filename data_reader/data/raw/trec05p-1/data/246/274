   Word of the Day for Saturday March 9, 2002:

   unctuous \UNGK-choo-us\, adjective:
   1.  Of the nature or quality of an unguent or ointment; fatty;
   oily; greasy.
   2. Having a smooth, greasy feel, as certain minerals.
   3.  Insincerely or excessively suave or ingratiating in manner
   or   speech;   marked  by  a  false  or  smug  earnestness  or
   agreeableness.

     A warmed, crusty French roll arrives split, lightly smeared
     with unctuous chopped liver.
     --John  Kessler,  "Meals To Go: Break from the routine with
     Hong,"  [1]Atlanta  Journal  and  Constitution, October 22,
     1998

     She recalled being offended by the "phoniness" that stemmed
     from  the contradiction between her mother's charming, even
     unctuous public manner and her anger in private.
     --Daniel  Horowitz, [2]Betty Friedan And the Making of 'The
     Feminine Mystique'

     He  approached  Sean  wearing a smile so unctuous it seemed
     about to slide right off his face.
     --Naeem Murr, [3]The Boy
     _________________________________________________________

   Unctuous  is from Medieval Latin unctuosus, from Latin unctus,
   "anointed, besmeared, greasy," past participle of unguere, "to
   anoint, to besmear."
