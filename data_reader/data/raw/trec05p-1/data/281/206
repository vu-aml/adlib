What must it feel like to have a fuck-friend?

Well, I can tell you from experience. It's very simple. 
No pointless dates or wasting my time with "getting to 
know each other". 

I get all the sex;) whenever I want, as much as I want.
I found mine on this Date-Site and You can find one too!
It's fun, safe and free:D
