<P><SPAN class=t>Strat Petroleum, Ltd. Advances Negotiations with Financing 
Group for $10 Million Funding for Saratov Oil Site</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=tt>Tuesday April 19, 10:12 am ET</SPAN> </P>
<P>
<DIV class=ar>TORONTO, Canada--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 19, 2005--Strat Petroleum, 
Ltd. (Pink Sheets: <A 
href="http://www.zinester.com/lr/156344/4952643">SPRL</A> - <A 
href="http://www.zinester.com/lr/156346/4952643">News</A>) issues update of 
financing for the Saratov oil site for up to $10 million line of credit towards 
acquisition and development of the site. 
<P>The Funding Group is currently completing its due diligence of the 
documentation received which includes licenses to the fields, preliminary 
valuation of the licenses by a British petroleum engineering services company, 
assets owned by the Company, and other reports and documents provided. 
<P>The Funding Group will be acquiring a 25% working interest in the wells being 
financed which are initially expected to be drilling of the two producing wells 
to bring them to commercial production status and then begin drilling of four 
new sites identified. The funding will not result in any further dilution as no 
new equity is expected to be issued to the Group. 
<P>Strat has also been in discussions with a private financing group and has 
received a letter of intent to fund the Company up to US $10 million to complete 
the acquisition, increase production from the two producing wells, and drill 
four new wells for which all approvals have been received. Further news about 
this opportunity will be released once due diligence and agreements have been 
completed. 
<P>Strat Petroleum, Ltd.'s strategy is to enhance shareholder value through the 
acquisition of oil & gas properties with proven reserves or producing/capped 
wells. Should you wish any additional information on our projects or management 
team, please visit our website at <A 
href="http://www.zinester.com/lr/156345/4952643">www.stratpetroleum.com</A> or contact our 
Investor Relations office. Due to the volume of interest we will make every 
effort to respond as promptly as possible.

number of risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause the Company's 
actual results to differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking 
statements. These risks, assumptions and uncertainties include: the ability to
