Breaking News!!

Gulf Biomedical Corporation (GBIC) is pleased to announce they have contracted with a major 
US nutriceutical manufacturer for the mass production of HairMagic(TM). HairMagic(TM) 
is a patented "breakthr0ugh" hair restoration product which is anticipated to generate first year 
revenues of nearly $6 milli0n. First year revenue was calculated by GBIC estimating over 100,000 
HairMagic packets sold, priced at $59 per packet. 
 
Don West, President of GBIC stated, "Our goal is to implement an aggressive online sales campaign, 
seeking to generate a first-year income of almost $6 million." Mr. West continued to state, 
"The sales campaign follows the 100% success rate of HairMagic(TM). To date, we have provided 
an initial treatment to 70 h@ir l0ss victims. All 70 subjects treated reported experiencing 
the re-growth of new h@ir on their heads within four weeks. While the evidence is anecdotal, 
it is so strong and positive, that we have gained strong interest from consumers and shareholders." 

Our HairMagic product line has experienced a 100 percent success rate of hair re-growth on our clients. 
We are not only confident in our hair re-growth product line, but we will provide a 100 percent refund 
to any client who does not see results within four weeks." Mr. West further stated, 
"We will begin aggressive marketing of our product line over the internet and radio during the next 3 months. 
We anticipate capturing one percent of sales from the 60 million balding men and women within the United States. 
Our first year revenue projections are estimated to be in excess of $1.5 million. 
As we continue increasing our revenue and marketing, we will expand nationally and prepare to move to a new exchange. 
Our outlook for 2005 is strong and we anticipate a rise in share price going forward."
