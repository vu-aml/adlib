The jury is still out!  LoreLei Reid's pick isn't on the spreadsheet that
Bob sent to me.  Everyone else is out.  LoreLei may have left a voice
message with Bob, or sent him an e-mail on Friday? I haven't spoken to Bob
yet today.  If she's not out.....she wins $740.    If she didn't
survive.....a decision needs to be made on what to do about the pool.

Options:
1.  Divide $740 among 13 people. ($56.92).  Game over!
2.  Let anyone who wants to collect their $57 do so.....then continue on
with the game with the ones who want to stay!   
 
Do you have LoreLei's phone number?

What did this week look like?  I'm out but I bet a lot of people are
too.  Shoot me the updated list please.  And what's up for the weekend?
I'm starting early!
