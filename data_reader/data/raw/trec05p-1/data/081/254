FYI -

I've had a few requests for changes to and enhancements of the EOL Download sheet. Dan Maxwell - of the 4th floor IT group - sent me those changes today. The download now allows you to sort by delivery point, or by hour, and has an added "refresh" feature. The date has also been reformatted to fit into our inc sheets (two digit instead of four digit year). Most importantly, the query now pulls in inter-desk swaps done on EOL.

The new EOL download is saved in p://real time/increment/windows 2000/NEW EOL DOWNLOAD

The sheet is still very basic and self-explanatory, so if you have anything to add, or questions about how to use it, please let me know.
