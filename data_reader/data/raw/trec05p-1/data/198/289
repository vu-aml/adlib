Thanks a bunch.  They wanted to know 2 clients and you were the first that came to mind and definitely my most favorite.  I will really miss working with you.  You are so efficient, easy going, smart, kind, helpful, etc.  the list goes on and on.  Take care, Maria

I thought it would be wise to broaden my horizons up here by applying to be licensed in the State of Nebraska.  Can I put you down as a client/reference?  By the way, what should I put down as your current occupation?  Maria
