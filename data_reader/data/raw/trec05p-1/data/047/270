Dear Jeffrey:

Will you be able to join other VentureWire subscribers
in the Bay Area for this month's Breakfast Briefing?

We'll be gathering at the San Mateo Marriott on
Wednesday, September 19, to hear Mark Klopp's thoughts
on this month's topic:

When Corporate and Venture Worlds Collide - Aligning
Investment Strategies to Drive Innovation and Generate
Returns

While times are certainly tough across the board, new
opportunities for creating profitable, sustainable
investment strategies continue to emerge. Innovative
companies such as Eastman Chemical have led the charge
in using venturing as a way to spur corporate
transformation and create long-term value. Moreover,
by understanding the often complementary strategies
that drive their respective investment decisions,
corporate and private VCs stand to gain a unique
perspective with which to explore mutually profitable
relationships.

   =B7 What is the current state of corporate venturing?
   =B7 What are some examples of corporations and VCs
     working together to build companies?
   =B7 How can you balance strategic vs. financial
     value?
   =B7 How can you prove value despite sagging returns?
   =B7 To what extent does the corporate VC serve as an
     "inside/outside pipe" for driving innovation?
   =B7 How can corporate VCs and private VCs leverage
     distinct skill sets in a spirit of cooperation to
     drive innovation and change?

Join us for a provocative discussion of these and
other important questions led by Mark Klopp, managing
director of Eastman Ventures, Eastman Chemical Co.

Register by Thursday, September 13th and you'll pay
only $99 and ensure your name in the attendance
roster. Register online for this VentureWire Breakfast
