<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0066620996/ref=mk_del_235668_401773040>Hundreds of business and investing books have crossed my desk this year. Below is a list of my favorites. Of these, Jim Collins's Good to Great <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0066620996/ref=mk_del_235668_41> is my pick for best business book of the year. The work is the result of five years of research into companies that have delivered extraordinary long-term results. You'll be surprised at not only the companies Collins tags as great, but at the approach they took to achieve their results.

by Jack Welch, John A. Byrne 
It's hard to think of a CEO that commands as much respect as Jack Welch. Under his leadership, General Electric reinvented itself several times over by integrating new and innovative practices, including Six Sigma and the Internet, into its many lines of business. In Jack: Straight from the Gut <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446528382/ref=mk_del_235668_47>, Welch, with the help of John Byrne, talks about his career and the style of management that helped to make GE one of the most successful companies of the last century. Jack: Straight from the Gut <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446528382/ref=mk_del_235668_48> promises to be the most sought-after business book of the year, so don't miss out--order your copy today.

by Juan Enriquez 
This is the most interesting and unique book that I've picked up in a long time. In As the Future Catches You <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609609033/ref=mk_del_235668_53>, Juan Enriquez of the Harvard Business School attempts to capture the trends--genomics in particular--that are shaping our future. Eye-popping typography and graphics coupled with a compact and almost poetic writing style make this thought-provoking book one to savor.

Gonzo Marketing: Winning Through Worst Practices <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204080/ref=mk_del_235668_57>     Icon <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/icon-books.gif>
by Christopher Locke 
Count on Chris Locke to poke holes in the conventional thinking that determines how companies relate to their markets. In Gonzo Marketing <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204080/ref=mk_del_235668_58>, Locke takes on the mass-market mindset that defines most big companies and prescribes a new and "dangerous" way for businesses to interact with customers. Smart and provocative, this book belongs on the shelf of any businessperson looking for a fresh point of view. Locke, who was a coauthor of The Cluetrain Manifesto <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204315/ref=mk_del_235668_59>, has been a longtime customer of Amazon.com. His personal page <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/cm/member-reviews/-/AH9RPJBDYJQFB/ref=mk_del_235668_60> at Amazon.com is worth a look.

The Myth of Excellence: Why Great Companies Never Try to Be the Best at Everything <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609608207/ref=mk_del_235668_64>     Icon <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/icon-books.gif>
by Fred Crawford, Ryan Mathews 
The first thing Fred Crawford and Ryan Mathews asked themselves after surveying 5,000 consumers was how their survey respondents could be so wrong. Their results so upset the conventional thinking about consumer marketing that the two began to reevaluate their assumptions about what American consumers really want--and the results will probably surprise you as well. In The Myth of Excellence, Crawford and Mathews show why "values" are taking center stage in today's marketplace.

Mark Smith traces the personalities, events, and ideas that have shaped the market, from figures such as Jesse Livermore and Benjamin Graham to events such as the Great Depression and the modern bull market to ideas such as behavioralism and the efficient market theory.

Brand New : How Entrepreneurs Earned Consumers' Trust from Wedgwood to Dell <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1578512212/ref=mk_del_235668_72>     Icon <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/icon-books.gif>
by Nancy F. Koehn 
In Brand New, Harvard Business School Professor Nancy Koehn looks at six extraordinary brands and the entrepreneurs that built them, from Josiah Wedgwood and Henry Heinz to Howard Schultz and Michael Dell. What interests Koehn is not so much the success these brands enjoyed as much as the trust these household names were able to inspire in consumers. Part business history, part marketing manual, Brand New is a revealing study of brand development that belongs on every thoughtful marketer's bookshelf.

Gonzo Marketing: Winning Through Worst Practices <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204080/ref=mk_del_235668_57>     Icon <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/icon-books.gif>
by Christopher Locke 
Count on Chris Locke to poke holes in the conventional thinking that determines how companies relate to their markets. In Gonzo Marketing <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204080/ref=mk_del_235668_58>, Locke takes on the mass-market mindset that defines most big companies and prescribes a new and "dangerous" way for businesses to interact with customers. Smart and provocative, this book belongs on the shelf of any businessperson looking for a fresh point of view. Locke, who was a coauthor of The Cluetrain Manifesto <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204315/ref=mk_del_235668_59>, has been a longtime customer of Amazon.com. His personal page <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/cm/member-reviews/-/AH9RPJBDYJQFB/ref=mk_del_235668_60> at Amazon.com is worth a look.

The Myth of Excellence: Why Great Companies Never Try to Be the Best at Everything <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609608207/ref=mk_del_235668_64>     Icon <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/icon-books.gif>
by Fred Crawford, Ryan Mathews 
The first thing Fred Crawford and Ryan Mathews asked themselves after surveying 5,000 consumers was how their survey respondents could be so wrong. Their results so upset the conventional thinking about consumer marketing that the two began to reevaluate their assumptions about what American consumers really want--and the results will probably surprise you as well. In The Myth of Excellence, Crawford and Mathews show why "values" are taking center stage in today's marketplace.

Brand New : How Entrepreneurs Earned Consumers' Trust from Wedgwood to Dell <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1578512212/ref=mk_del_235668_72>     Icon <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/icon-books.gif>
by Nancy F. Koehn 
In Brand New, Harvard Business School Professor Nancy Koehn looks at six extraordinary brands and the entrepreneurs that built them, from Josiah Wedgwood and Henry Heinz to Howard Schultz and Michael Dell. What interests Koehn is not so much the success these brands enjoyed as much as the trust these household names were able to inspire in consumers. Part business history, part marketing manual, Brand New is a revealing study of brand development that belongs on every thoughtful marketer's bookshelf.
