Gerald,

If you are ok with this, would you please put together executable copies for us to sign and get to Ormat.  If not, let me know.

Chris,
The CA looks okay.  I made one change in para 4 that requires Enron to identify and mark the confidential information sent to Ormat.  I presume that not ALL correspondence between us will have to do with structured horsepower transactions.

See attached.

Hank

Hank,

You will find attached a confidentiality agreement as discussed for your
review.  We will call you early next week to discuss the potential
Transwestern deal further.  Have a good weekend.
