Welcome to the new Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group (SVMG) website!

On Friday, October 26, 2001, M3iworks & SVMG proudly launched SVMG's new
website--designed to be the "go-to" site for SVMG member companies,
legislators representing Silicon Valley, and public and private sector
entities concerned about key Silicon Valley quality-of-life issues and what
employers and legislators are doing to address the critical challenges we
face.
