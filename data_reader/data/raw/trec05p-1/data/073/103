I am assuming these were the last contracts.  They are the last ones I was forwarded any how.  None the less, my top two concerns Today:

I assume we are going to compare the predicted economics to the actual economics then look at alternatives to options in Sun Devil (Like a GE turbine)  I've got an idea of what we can do for the fuel portion of this deal if we do look at turbines.
One of the issues dicussed in detail before we did this project with ECS was WHY is TW doing a deal with ECS versus a stand alone deal.  If I remember correctly, the pitch to FERC was that TW did not have the expertise to facilitate a peak avoidance alone.  Mary Kay Miller should remember these details...

Attention Korey........Per phone call this morning.......    



The CSA specifies ECS's obligation in helping us avoid the demand energy charge.  The demand charge is $12.21 * 10,000 KW  * 12 Months = $1.465,200 of potential rebate back to TW each year.
