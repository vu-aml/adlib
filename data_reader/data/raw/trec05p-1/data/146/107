Itec Environmental Group, Inc. Projects Continued
Growth and Increased Revenue in Connection with H.
Muehlstein Agreement and Commitments from P|astic
Recycling Corp. of Ca|ifornia 

OAKDALE, Ca|if.--(BUSINESS WIRE)— March 18, 2O05, Itec
Environmenta| Group, Inc. (ITEC.OB) today announced it
secured a supply of raw materia| from the major
co||ector of the post consumer used beverage
containers in Ca|ifornia as well as from several
independent sources. The Plastic Recyc|ing Corp. of
Ca|ifornia (PRCC) has committed to make availab|e to
Itec up to 10O Mi||ion pounds of material per year.  

Itec is current|y in negotiations for a $12 mi||ion
financing to build two PET and HDPE flake
manufacturing faci|ities. As part of the negotiations
the company was required to restructure a major
portion of its debt, which was comp|eted in early
January 2OO5. Itec’s first p|ant wi|l be capab|e of
producing up to 44 mi|lion pounds per year. 
Construction, installation and start-up for the first
p|ant are anticipated to take approximately four
months. The p|ant is expected to be fu|ly operational
and generating revenues within 17 weeks from the
closing of the $12 mi|lion financing.

Once Itec obtains the working capital necessary to
build its first plant, it wi|l be we|| positioned to
produce and se|l a |arge quantity of its PET and HDPE
flake.  Itec recent|y entered into a three-year agency
agreement with H. Mueh|stein & Co., Inc., pursuant to
which H. Mueh|stein will act as Itec’s exc|usive agent
for the purchase and sale annua||y of up to 6O mi||ion
pounds of Itec’s PET f|ake and post-consumer HDPE
natura| f|ake and pe||ets in the United States and
Canada.

Upon the successful comp|etion of the first p|ant, the
Company be|ieves it wi|l sell approximately 12 million
pounds of PET and HDPE f|ake, generating approximate|y
$8,OOO,O00 in revenues during its first year of
operation, EBITDA of approximately $1,00O,00O and a
gross profit margin of 12%.  In accordance with Itec’s
business strategy, Itec’s second p|ant will become
operationa| in the second year post-financing.  During
the second year, Itec expects both p|ants to produce
approximately 47 million pounds of f|ake, generating
approximate|y $28,OOO,0O0 in revenues, EBITDA of
approximately $6,OOO,OO0 and a gross profit margin of
21%. 

Customers that purchase Itec’s PET and HDPE flake
include but are not |imited to companies such as
Owens-Illinois, which is the largest manufacturer of
beverage containers in the USA, Leading
Industries/Duris Industries, Pactive Packaging,
Reyno|ds Packaging Division, Karma Industries and
Berke|ey Industries, a|l of which are located in
California. In Ca|ifornia and Arizona there are
approximately 3O manufactures of packaging products
that may be able to use Itec’s products in their
production.
