      name Global Cedar. They currently manufacture over 110 furniture products. 
      First year revenues are expected to total approximately $6 million,

      <LI><FONT face=Verdana><STRONG>Global Cedar:</STRONG> in addition to 
      manufacturing furniture, the company intends to sell and distribute its 
      proprietary product, the Global Cedar Tree, in order to foster the growth 
      of plantations that provide timber for construction, furniture building, 
      wood pulp, and other products. The tree grows well in a variety of 
      climactic conditions, and the plantlets contain no contaminants and are 
      subject to no known import/export restrictions. Therefore, the 
      marketability of this product is extremely high.</FONT> </LI></DIV>
      <DIV><FONT face=Verdana></FONT> </DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <LI><FONT face=Verdana>The Global Cedar Tree is the result of 14 
      years of research and genetic technology development. <STRONG><FONT 
      color=#cc0000>It is the fastest growing hardwood tree on the planet, 
      capable of achieving growth levels of 30-35 feet in its first year 
      alone!</FONT></STRONG> After just the first year, the tree can be 
      harvested and will re-grow from the stump, providing multiple harvests for 
      years. The timber produced is excellent for fine furniture and other uses 
      for which the wood of fast growing soft woods is unsuitable. The potential 
      benefits of the tree are legion, from positive effects on the ozone and a 
      buffer against rainforest depletion, as world demand for wood products 
      continues to outpace world supply. </FONT></LI></DIV>
