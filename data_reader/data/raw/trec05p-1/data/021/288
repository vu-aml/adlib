Jeff we talked about developing messages around PGE's pricing, etc.  I'll check with the PGE folks to get a good set of facts to address this issue.  Messaging is tough, but I'd suggest we focus on:  (1) the total dollars at issue--$318,071 isn't a big deal; (2) PGE is 61 out of 74 in terns of total sales; and (3) PGE's took a position in the market and is selling power purchased at high prices (PGE is a net short position).  

The additional facts we need are how the dollars flow to Enron Corp. given PGE's power cost adjustment stipulation.

FYI.

In case you haven't seen it. According to MRW's analysis for IEP, Portland General sold the highest-price power to DWR in 1Q01. But at $318,071, PGE is 61 out of 74 in terms of total sales dollars.  The highest is Mirant at $706 million.  

Enron Power Marketing is #60 out of 74 in terms of prices charged, and #26 in terms of totals sales to DWR (about $45MM), according to the analysis.

Best,
Jeff
