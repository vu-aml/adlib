Looks good. Obviously very close to what I originally suggested!
 
I spoke with Michelle who seems ok with it. There was a suggestion from Lance that he wanted to make sure Muller and Top Gun were ok before we proceed. You may have heard independently from Muller on this point.
 
So, do you want me to get Julie Clyatt tee'd up, to prepare with names and numbers?
