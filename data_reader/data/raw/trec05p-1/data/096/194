Attached are the remaining LJM questions from the all-employee meeting today.  I have not included questions that were answered in full during the meeting.  I have also tried to eliminate the majority of duplicates.  You'll note a lot of references to ethics and values, as we anticipated.  Mark Frevert asked if we were going to post these questions and their responses on the intranet or elsewhere (we could do it in eMeet).  Please let us know if we need to begin preparations for this.
