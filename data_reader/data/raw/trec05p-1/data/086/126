Danny:
Please see your travel itinerary for SGA Conference.  Note that Sunday departure was required as no Monday flights would get you in time for conference and were connections (example, American flight departing at 6:10 am with arrival into Palm Beach at 11:50.
Note, there is a direct later flight on Sunday night, 6:45 pm with arrival into Palm Beach 10:09.  Please advise if you want to change to later flight.
As you can see it is challenging on the return flight too.  I booked you out of Fort Lauderdale as no direct flights from Palm Beach were available.  The  earlier flight from Palm Beach was a connection with arrival at 7:00 pm into Houston so the  3:04 direct flight out Fort Lauderdale was a better choice.  Fort Lauderdale is about 40 miles from Palm Beach. Please advise if you wish to make any changes.
