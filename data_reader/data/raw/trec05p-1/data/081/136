Rick, 
 
Look like London HR have put forward Bruno Gaillard as a possible transfer back to NA.  My sense is that Bruno is much too junior (and perhaps not as polished) relative to what I'm looking for in Toronto but I thought I would share this with you anyway and see if you disagree with me.

Jon, 
Robert suggested I contact you regarding any potential re-deployment opportunities in Canada.  Essentially, if you have any ex-Canadians who might be interested in commercial or commercial support roles, we would certainly entertain the idea of hiring here.  We would only be interested in strong performers.  Got any candidates??

Thanks!
