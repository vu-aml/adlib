Latest NFL Player News

Corey Bradford <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=12234&>, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove himself as a Fantasy player.

Bubba Franks <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions was good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games this year and has become a major scoring thr! ea! t even though he is not very effective outside of the red zone.

Derrick Alexander <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1191&>, WR KC - Top Dogs Updated 10/21/01
Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench him. 

Trent Green <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1599&>, QB KC - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod every week. 

Doug Chapman <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/el! in! k?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=187510&> , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay healthy or continues to struggle.

David Boston <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Tomaski Updated 10/21/01
Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Michael ! Pi! ttman <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Top Dogs Updated 10/21/01
Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster. 

Jeff Graham <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot. 

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=235249&>, RB SD - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league. 

Desmond Clark <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=133250&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis. 

Brian Griese <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=12409&>, QB DEN - TayDang Updated 10/21/01
Griese (shoulder) started Sunday's game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss. 

Peter Warrick <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.c! om! /mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=187401&> , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not find the end zone often. 

Corey Dillon <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.

David Terrell <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Terrell caught seven passes for 91 ! ya! rds against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago passing game. 

Anthony Thomas <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest of the year.

Frank Wycheck <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yards and a TD at Detroit. Despite some quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.

Charlie Batch <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.! co! m/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=12204&> , QB DET - Pink Panthers Updated 10/21/01
Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.

Steve McNair <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1069&>, QB TEN - McKay Updated 10/21/01
McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.

Eddie George <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Fear! Updated 10/21/01
George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hindered his production this year. 

Shawn Jefferson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect good numbers from him every week.

Alge Crumpler <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=235206&>, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick ! ti! ght end for the remainder of the year.

Albert Connell <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1851&>, WR NO - FJS Updated 10/21/01
Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.

Willie Jackson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1234&>, WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not capable of providing owners with regularly good numbers.

Hines Ward <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4! 09! 4&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Grigsby Updated 10/21/01
Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still making important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.

Warrick Dunn <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1171&>, RB TB - TexOK Updated 10/21/01
Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.

Anthony Becht <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=187740&>, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Becht had a huge game against St.! L! ouis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but his potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a position lacking quality players. 

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1265&>, WR TB - The Rocks Updated 10/21/01
Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.

Jerome Bettis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1152&>, RB PIT - The Rocks Updated 10/21/01
Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against any defense.

Trung Canidate <http://football210.fantasy.spo! rt! sline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=187503&> , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Canidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk. 

Rod Gardner <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, posting six catches for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspective.
