Attached please find Select Energy's notice of objection to the general
terms and conditions (GT&Cs) referenced in deal confirmation # 1090348.
Please review our proposed changes for use in this confirmation as well as
additional transactions until such time that we enter into a master gas
agreement.  We are available to discuss this with you, I can be reached at
860-665-2411.
