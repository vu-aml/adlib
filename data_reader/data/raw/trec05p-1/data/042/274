USE THIS FUND TO BLESS THE POOR.
From: Mrs. Rosemary Cross.
 I am the above named person but now undergoing 
medical treatment for cancer now. I am married to
Dr.George Cross who worked with South African embassy
in Malaysia  for nine years before  he died in the
year 2000.
 
  We were married for eleven years without a child. He
died after a brief illness that lasted for only four
days. Before his death we were both born again
Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry
or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the
Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he
deposited the sum  of$27.6Million (twenty-seven
Million six hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one
finiance company in Europe. 
   
Presently, this money is still with the Security
Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not
last for the next three months due to cancer
problem.Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. 
Having known my condition I decided to donate this
fund to church or better still a christian individual 
that will utilize this money, the way I am going to
instruct hereUSE THIS FUND TO BLESS THE POOR.

problem.Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. 
Having known my condition I decided to donate this
fund to church or better still a christian individual 
that will utilize this money the way I am going to
instruct herein;  
I want a church or individual that will use this money to
fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the
word of God, and, to ensure that the house of God is
maintained. The Bible made us to understand that
Blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision
because I don't have any child that will inherit this
money and my husband relatives are not Christians and
I don't want my husbands hard earned money to be
misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where
this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence
the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not
afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know
that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord.
Exodus 14 VS 14 says; that, the lord will fight my case
and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone
communication in this regard because of my health,and
because of the presence of my husbands relatives
around me always. I don't want them to know about this
development. With God all things are possible. As soon
as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact
of the  Finance/Security Company in Europe. 
I will also issue you a letter of authority that will
empower you as the original- beneficiary of this fund.
I want you and the church to always pray for me
because the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that
I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that
wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit,and
truth. Please always be prayerful all through your
life.  Any delay in your reply will give me room in
sourcing for, an alternative  church or christian individual for this
same purpose. Please assure me that you will act 
accordingly as I stated herein;
Please get in touch with me urgently by
E-mail: rosemary_cross1958@hotmail.co.uk,
and avail me the following;
1. Full Name.
2. Your Telephone Number,email address and  Fax Number.
3. Your Contact Address.
Your urgent response will be highly anticipated and appreciated.
Hoping to hear from you Soonest. 
 
Remain blessed in the name of the Lord, His Love.
Mrs. Rosemary Cross
