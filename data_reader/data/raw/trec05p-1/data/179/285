Matt:

	I am forwarding the documents that I spoke to you about.  The first is the unanimous consent, the second is the secretary's certificate and the third is a page that Eric will need to sign.  The secretary's certificate outlines the resolution adopted and the authority issue.  Let me know if this works.
