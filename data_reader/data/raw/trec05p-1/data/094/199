Will you have time for lunch or dinner while you're here?  Would be great to catch up.

Also, I heard some things mentioned that people might like to see in your followup:
Along with the timeline, describe the "macro" of how the pipe is scheduled/balanced and then go to the detail of how contracts and rate types stack up and get matched across the pipe with up/downstream.  Also when a delivery area is constrained and when a receipt area is constrained.  (pictures may help)

Another whole session could be devoted to the allocation at billing time -- least path, penalty application, etc.

Thanks, Jane
