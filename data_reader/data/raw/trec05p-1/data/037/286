All - 
I got a couple of call making sure that the meeting is scheduled for tomorrow (Wednesday) the 29th.  That is correct.  In my prior message I had said Wednesday the 28th which was incorrect.  There's an omen following me around today.  Hopefully tomorrow will be better.  See you all tomorrow.  Elliot, we will call you.

Thanks Mary Jo.  Just wanted to send out a reminder to all that we are on for 3:00 p.m.  tomorrow in EB 4795.  Mary Jo and I discussed briefly the goals for the meeting, which I'll briefly recap:

1. Have notional prices for commodity and RECs
2. Have contract language, including REC language that Richard provided
3. Give Steve a firm "offer" to take to his boss, Bill Donovan
4. Have some feedback from accounting on the accrual aspect
5. Determine final steps for contract terms and execution

Look forward to hopefully getting close to wrapping this up for everyone.  Thanks again Mary Jo for your leg work on this deal.

Please call if you have any questions.  I would like to know what everyone wants to accomplish by this meeting.  I know that Richard and Elliot have constructed some "Renewable language" in a contract we are currently working.  We will bring the pricing with the $6.00 adder that Richard has suggested that we use for the power.
