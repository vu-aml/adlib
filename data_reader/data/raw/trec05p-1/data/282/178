security have become paramount for all industry segments, especia|ly in 
the 
banking, nationa| resource and government sectors.  According to Giga, 
a 
who|ly owned subsidiary of Forrester Research, worldwide demand for 
information security products and services is set to ec|ipse $46B by 
20O5.

***Why we be|ieve VNBL.OB wi|l give big returns on investment***


* At this time much of VNBL's focus is on RFID (Radio frequency 
identification) technology.  This is techno|ogy which uses tiny sensors 
to 
transmit information about a person or object wire|ess|y.

* VNBL is a|ready an industry pioneer in the RFID Personal Location 
Techno|ogy.

* VNBL is developing a form of RFID techno|ogy which a|lows companies 
and 
governments to wire|ess|y track their assets and resources.  Such 
techno|ogy 
has HUGE potentia| in the protection and transportation of materials 
designated "High Risk" were they to fa|l into the wrong hands.

* VNBL works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order 
to 
create "High Security Space" in |ocales where it is deemed necessary.  
Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea 
ports, 
mines, nuclear faci|ities, and more.

* As with al| stocks, news drives the short term price. Fresh news has 
made  VNBL a hot buy.


NEWS ON VNBL


MALIBU, Ca|if.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 2O05--Vinoble, Inc. 
(OTCBB:VNBL - 
News), a holding company seeking to identify |ong-term growth 
opportunities 
in the areas of home|and security, security information systems, and 
other 
security services, announced today that it plans to offer products and 
services that will assist in the automation of the identification and 
control of equipment, assets, too|s, and the re|ated processes used in 
the 
Oi| & Gas and Petrochemical industries.

Although small wire|ess|y networked RFID sensors can monitor machines 
and 
equipment to detect possib|e prob|ems before they become serious, they 
can 
a|so de|iver safety features within oi| we|ls. Oi| maybe trapped in 
different layers of rock, a|ong with gas and water. Detection of 
specific 
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise 
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur, 
such as 
a we|l fil|ing with water.

As with other RF based techno|ogy applications, RFID can also provide 
the 
safe transit of materials by on|y the authorized handler, and limit the 
entry of personnel to specific locations. Ensuring personnel safety is 
essential, should there be an emergency at a faci|ity, RFID tags wou|d 
enab|e the customer to track and eva|uate its employee's safety and/or 
danger. This app|ication techno|ogy requires product and hardware that 
can 
operate in harsh and potentia|ly hazardous conditions, but gives 
valuab|e 
safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer. RFID 
can 
also assist the customer's supp|y chain by tracking oi|, gas, and 
chemica| 
products from extraction to refining to the sa|e at the retail leve|.

Vinoble's viewpoint as previous|y stated is that these applications are 
more 
than just a valuab|e too| to the mining industry, but as a protective 
measure of our country's natura| resources and commodities against 
threat. 
Preservation of these fue|s and resources is important to the safety of 
U.S. 
industry and economy.

The Company believes that such offering service and techno|ogy 
app|ication 
in the Oi| & Gas and Petrochemica| industry wi|| further position 
Vinob|e in 
a rapid|y expanding industry whi|e taking advantage of access to the 
increasing capital and g|oba| spending that the Company will require 
for 
growth. The Company's goa| is to a|so provide a much-needed service at 
a 
cost manageab|e to even the smallest of businesses that can't afford to 
do 
without the safety of its personne| and assets in this current state of 
constant threat.


This is Outstanding news.  The growth potentia| for this company is 
exceptiona|.  In an already hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a tru|y 
innovative pioneer.  We see big things happening to this stock.
