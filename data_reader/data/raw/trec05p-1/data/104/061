Tired of banging your head up against corporate recruiting?
Got a great idea for how to create Haas's next $100 million success story?

Come to the 2002 Business Plan Competition's Kick-off Event next Monday at 6pm in Andersen Auditorium: 

* Hear some of the world's top VC's tell you the secrets to securing funding... 
* Find out how the Business Plan Competition can put you in touch with some of the world's greatest engineering and business minds... 
* Get a preview of this year's workshops and events, all of which are designed to help you make your ideas come to life... 

It's you chance to win $90,000 in cash prizes . . . . . and, maybe, become THE NEXT BIG THING.
