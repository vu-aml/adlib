There is an OBA Payback nomination at two points, POI 1709 Linam Ranch and POI 152 Reeves.  The payback is for 5,000 dth/day at both points.  One is a receipt to NNG (Reeves) and the other is a delivery to Duke (Linam Ranch).  Since NNG controls Reeves there should not be any problems there, but at Linam Ranch, Duke operates the point.  Please give me or someone on the South Central team a call if Linam Ranch is running over their order so we can call the scheduler and have them make corrections to their volumes.

Your help is greatly appreciated.

New scheduler for Duke is Wayne Hawkins - 915-620-4214,
