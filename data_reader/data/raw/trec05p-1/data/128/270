Lorie -

Please see the attached version of the LOI.  I have added a paragraph - paragraph 6 - as a non-solicitation provision.  Be aware that these usually are negotiated to be mutual and, in that event, I will be required to obtain approval of a mutual provision at three different levels, including Corp.  This is current policy within the company to ensure we do not bind other divisions or groups to a non-solicit that we cannot comply with.

Let me know your thoughts.

Mark
