Thanks for your interest and response to the previous message about the
EMCA Citizen Patrol.  About 13 people have volunteered to participate so
far.  In order to make this a successful endeavor we need around 20
people to show up for the introductory meeting.  More would be better as
there is always a natural attrition rate.

If we as a neighborhood sincerely want something like the Citizen Patrol
to become a reality then we are going to require the participation of
more than the usual people who come out for everything.  This is a
commitment to the security of our neighborhood.  Thugs and scum don't
care if you rent or own, if you've paid your dues or not.  If you are
interested in making this happen then you need to arrange your schedule
and your priorities and step up to the plate.

If we don't get the 20 people we need at the introductory meeting then
the Citizen Patrol will be a no go until someone else decides to bring
it up again.

Those of you who are holding back, please give it some thought.

regards,

Jaimie Evans
