I have attached a draft of a proposed settlement and release agreement related to the Development and Revenue Sharing Agreement with RiskMetrics.  You will notice that I have left blank for the time being paragraph 7 related to use of Confidential Information pending receipt of the prior Confidentiality Agreement signed by the parties.  I have also assumed that we don't want any claims or causes of action to survive except based upon breaches of confidentiality provisions.  If that is not correct, let me know.  Please call me with any questions/comments after you have had a chance to review the draft.  Thanks.
