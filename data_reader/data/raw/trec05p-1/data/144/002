In a discussion with Steve Kirk, prior to changing the priorities, it was agreed that SBA shippers should have priority over Interruptible and Alternate shippers only.  Firm shippers would continue to have priority over SBA shippers.  Since Gerry's group implemented the changes, we have not been in a situation where a SBA was called to come in (or go out) at an allocated point.  Gerry's system requirements as to how the system would operate under these conditions would be the support you need to verify that Firm shippers have priority over SBAs.   

Gerry, would you forward Michelle a copy of the System Requirement?   Thanks.

Michele,
I'm not sure the information is readily available, if available at all. TMS data is only maintained, without extraordinary measures, for 6 months. It is my recollection that there may have been an allocation at a point where SBA gas was scheduled and when that occurred the standard allocation procedures were enforced. I think once we asked the shipper  to move the SBA activity to another point, but that was pre GISB. Unfortunately, because of the how the SBA's work, the pack, draft and peak points are negotiated in advance which limits the points to use. Also, the 28-30 hr lead time required for notification means that we have to anticipate what system conditions will become and therein use SBAs to improve system conditions. Sometimes we miss the mark, either cold weather does not materialize or moves in late or shipper activity increases and in hindsight, an SBA was not necessary.  

Reyna may have some additional insight in more recent SBA activities.

I am not sure I understand the question.  Do you mean at anytime we call on SBA volumes, we never/should not allocate the location?

	I guess the question is - have we ever actually reviewed when we call on the SBA volumes and what the system conditions have been during those periods.  We want to verify that we are not allocating a point when we have SBA gas flowing.  Theatrically, we argue that we would not call on SBAs if the gas was not needed to meet system requirements.  We' want to verify that the theory and the actual match up.  I hope this makes sense.  Thanks MW

Yes, you are correct. The changes in the business requirements for the scheduling priority of SBA contracts will not impact NNG's primary firm shippers. What do you need to verify and support this fact?

	These are the SBA contracts that were provided during the due diligence.  I'd like to be able to verify and support that the changes in the business requirements for the scheduling priority for these SBA contracts do not result in an impact to NNG's primary firm shippers.  Your assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks MW
