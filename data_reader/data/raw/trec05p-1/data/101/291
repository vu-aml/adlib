	The Indian Embassy has reconfirmed the meeting on the 8th.  We are trying to set it up for late afternnoon.  Since the PMO Sec'y will have with him probably one from the embasssy and a notetaker, they have requested  a maximum of three on our side.  Thanks  John

He received from them a commitment to "get the government energized towards a solution before the PM comes to Washington."

	The US-India Business Council is also planning a letter to the PM which would underscore the short time left for negotiations and the need for the GOI to designate a schedule for meeting. One would think the PM would want to have made progress before arriving in Washington, but ...  John
