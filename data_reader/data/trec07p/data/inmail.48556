Political Hot Topics
(Today's top political stories from news organizations across the country)

ENVIRONMENTALISTS "PESSIMISTIC" ABOUT WH GREENHOUSE GAS PUSH: President Bush's call for international meetings on
greenhouse gas emissions has sharpened next week's debate at the Group of Eight summit of industrialized nations on
global warming. Bush proposed Thursday that countries producing the most greenhouse gases meet and develop a strategy
to reduce emissions by the end of 2008. He also urged other nations to spend more money on new technologies for "clean
energy." "The world is on the verge of great breakthroughs that will help us become better stewards of the
environment," he said. Charles Kupchan, director of Europe studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Bush's
plan is "better than nothing" but suspects "it will not satisfy the European hankering for some concrete targets."
Environmentalists were pessimistic Bush's plan or the G-8 talks in Germany June 6-8 would be productive. "It is kind of
frustrating for any progress that could be made at the G-8," said Sierra Club spokesman David Willett. USA Today:
Reaction lukewarm to Bush on emissions http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20070601/1a_lede01_dom.art.htm

STATE ISSUES "UNUSUALLY SHARP PUBLIC CRITICISM" OF PUTIN'S RUSSIA: A top Russia expert at the State Department issued
an unusually sharp public criticism on Thursday of Moscow's behavior under President Vladimir V. Putin, describing the
Kremlin as bullying its neighbors while silencing political opponents and suppressing individual rights at home. The
comments, approved by the White House, are the latest volley of criticism between Washington and Moscow in recent days.
Although the White House said this week that President Bush would play host to Mr. Putin on July 1 at the Bush family
compound in Maine, the speech is likely to add tension at a time when the broader dialogue between Washington and
Moscow is already taking the most caustic tones since the collapse of communism. New York Times: Administration Rebukes
Putin on His Policies http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/01/washington/01russia.html

REPUBLICANS ASKING THEMSELVES, "WHAT ARE REPUBLICANS?" Their president's approval ratings are at historic lows. The war
in Iraq is grinding down their political prospects, and their party is showing deep divisions on issues such as
education and immigration. But to House Minority Leader John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), Republicans' path to power rests on
brand recognition. Boehner has convened a group of allies and confidantes to work on GOP "branding," an exercise
designed to restore an identity to a party that many voters no longer see as holding a core set of principles.

RNC FIRES ALL 65 PHONE SOLICITORS: The Republican National Committee, hit by a grass-roots donors' rebellion over
President Bush's immigration policy, has fired all 65 of its telephone solicitors, The Washington Times has learned.
Faced with an estimated 40 percent falloff in small-donor contributions and aging phone-bank equipment that the RNC
said would cost too much to update, Anne Hathaway, the committee's chief of staff, summoned the solicitations staff and
told them they were out of work, effective immediately, fired staff members told The Times. Several of the solicitors
fired at the May 24 meeting reported declining contributions and a donor backlash against the immigration proposals now
being pushed by Mr. Bush and Senate Republicans. Washington Times: RNC faces donor falloff, fires solicitors

LIBBY LAWYERS SAY 30+ MO. SENTENCE "GROSSLY DISPROPORTIONATE" TO CRIME: Defense lawyers argued yesterday that Vice
President Cheney's former chief of staff should serve no time in prison for lying about the leak of a covert agent's
identity, on the grounds that he is a selfless, apolitical public servant with an otherwise "exemplary" record. I.
Lewis "Scooter" Libby's attorneys asserted in a court filing that a federal prosecutor's proposal that their client
spend 30 to 37 months in prison is "grossly disproportionate" to the crimes that provoked a jury's guilty verdict in
March. Libby, who is scheduled to be sentenced in federal court in Washington on Tuesday, was convicted of four counts
of committing perjury, lying to the FBI and obstructing a probe into the leak of CIA officer Valerie Plame's classified
identity. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/31/AR2007053102209.html

PLAME, SIMON & SCHUSTER FILE SUIT AGAINST CIA: Valerie Wilson, the former intelligence operative at the heart of an
investigation that reached into the White House, sued the Central Intelligence Agency in federal court in New York
yesterday over its refusal to allow her to publish a memoir that would discuss how long she had worked for the agency.
Although that information is set out in an unclassified letter to Ms. Wilson that has been published in the
Congressional Record, the C.I.A. contends that her dates of service remain classified and may not be mentioned in "Fair
Game," the memoir Ms. Wilson hopes to publish in October. New York Times: Plame Sues C.I.A. for Blocking Her Memoir
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/01/us/01plame.html

IMMIGRATION DEAL DIVIDES AFL-CIO, SEIU: Competing demands by two factions of organized labor could sink the latest
immigration legislation, dividing congressional Democrats who rely on union support. The labor divide reflects a deeper
rift within the party, which includes a growing constituency of immigrants as well as middle-class workers afraid of
layoffs as U.S. jobs move overseas. On one side of the debate are the AFL-CIO and other large industrial unions whose
members have historically seen illegal immigrants as unwanted competitors. The other side includes the Service
Employees International Union, whose members have healthcare, property management and public service jobs, and Unite
Here, which represents garment, hotel and restaurant workers. These unions have embraced immigrants, even those here
illegally. Los Angeles Times: Unions split over immigration bill
http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-immig1jun01,1,2308816.story

ENGLISH... THE "COMMON" LANGUAGE VS. THE "OFFICIAL" LANGUAGE: Some Republican senators are calling the English-language
requirements in the immigration bill toothless and want the bill to declare English the "national" language of the U.S.
and the country's official means of doing business. The fight is over whether the bill should call English the "common"
language -- as it reads now -- or deem it the "national," or official language, which the Republican senators say would
cut the amount of government services provided in other languages and would overturn President Clinton's 2000 executive
order that encouraged federal services to be delivered in different languages. Sen. James M. Inhofe, Oklahoma
Republican, has proposed an amendment to make English the national language -- a move that he said declares that "there
is not an entitlement for language, other than the English language, to be given to people who want government
services. Very simple." Washington Times: GOP tries to make English official
http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20070601-122911-7447r.htm

HEADING INTO DEBATES, IRAQ "THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE": As the dual debates for Democrats and Republicans at Saint
Anselm College draw near, political analysts say the war in Iraq remains the most important issue in the Presidential
campaign. "That is the dominant issue," said Wolf Blitzer, the CNN anchor who will be the moderator at the debates.
"American men and women are dying right now. There's a war going on. I think that sort of overshadows these (other)
issues right now." Aside from Iraq, candidates likely will have to address Iran, North Korea and other foreign policy
issues, Blitzer said, while issues on the domestic side will run the gamut from taxes, the future of Social Security,
and health care to issues like abortion and gay marriage. New Hampshire Union Leader: Iraq to dominate Presidential
debates http://unionleader.com/

PERSONAL FAITH "A VERY PUBLIC PART" OF THE '08 CAMPAIGN: Lately it seems all the leading presidential candidates are
discussing their religious and moral beliefs — even when they'd rather not. Indeed, seven years after George W. Bush
won the presidency in part with a direct appeal to conservative religious voters — even saying during a debate that
Jesus Christ was his favorite philosopher — the personal faith of candidates has become a very public part of the
presidential campaign. Democratic Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama have hired strategists to focus on
reaching religious voters. Obama's campaign holds a weekly conference call with key supporters in early primary and
caucus states whose role is to spread the candidate's message to religious leaders and opinionmakers and report their
concerns to the campaign. AP via Yahoo! News: Faith playing larger role in 2008 race

SOME SAY McCAIN RISKS "POLITICAL SUICIDE" WITH IMMIGRATION STRATEGY: John McCain is betting that he can revive his
reputation for straight talk, and his campaign, by challenging his rivals for the Republican nomination on the issue of
immigration. McCain, 70, is championing legislation that the other contenders, and many of the party's core voters,
denounce as an amnesty program for illegal immigrants. While some Republican strategists say this strategy risks
political suicide, the Arizona senator said he is following a contrarian script that has served him well. "I've taken
on other political risks" and "almost all of the time when I do what I believe is right it turns out OK in the end,"
McCain said in a May 29 telephone interview. Bloomberg: McCain Confronts Rivals on Immigration to Regain Maverick Aura
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&sid=aynGLB.7ReLk

WHAT WOULD ROMNEY DO? A blunt cliché best captures John McCain's rebuttal to persistent attacks from Mitt Romney over
his immigration plan: Put up or shut up. In his appeals to conservative voters, Romney has made the Arizona senator's
work on immigration one of his favorite targets. When McCain and other senators unveiled the latest reform bill two
weeks ago, Romney called it the "wrong approach" and immediately launched a television ad slamming "amnesty" for
illegal immigrants. But while Romney has been aggressive with his barbs, he has offered no specific solutions of his
own to the immigration crisis. With McCain and his surrogates pushing the issue hard, Romney is facing increasing
questions about what he would do about the problem. Boston Globe: Critics press Romney on immigration view
http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/06/01/critics_press_romney_on_immigration_view/

EDWARDS CAMP RETRACTS STATEMENT ON '02 NIE: Former Senator John Edwards, a Democratic presidential candidate, told an
interviewer on Wednesday that he had read the classified October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate before voting to
authorize force in Iraq, but his campaign retracted the statement yesterday. A spokesman for Mr. Edwards said the
candidate had "simply misunderstood the question" and noted that Mr. Edwards had read only a declassified version of
the intelligence report. The issue of who had read the full report has bubbled up over the last week with reports that
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, had not read it before voting to authorize force in Iraq, even
though she and other senators had access to the document. The report was the government's most comprehensive
intelligence assessment of Iraq's prewar capability for unconventional weapons. New York Times: Aide Says Edwards
Misspoke on Reading Classified Iraq Report http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/01/us/politics/01rudy.html

HILLARY PLATFORM "WOULDN'T EVEN GET HER ELECTED IN FRANCE," SAYS MITT: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on
Thursday criticized Democratic rival Hillary Rodham Clinton as a European caricature who would turn the United States
into a welfare state. Speaking to about 200 people in Sioux City, Romney said he wanted to highlight the differences
between himself and Clinton, the front-runner for her party's presidential nomination. "Her view is the old, classic,
European caricature that we describe of big government, big taxation, welfare state," said the former Massachusetts
governor. "She gave a speech a couple of days ago and laid out her vision for America. And as I listened to her I
figured her platform wouldn't even get her elected in France," Romney, who was a missionary in France, said to chuckles
and applause. AP via Yahoo! News: Romney: Clinton a European caricature
http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070531/ap_on_el_pr/on_the2008_trail

CLINTON TALKS TECH TO SILICON VALLEY CHIEFS: Democratic front-runner Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a Silicon Valley
visit which reprised some of the favorite technology-friendly themes of her husband, former President Bill Clinton,
argued Thursday that the nation must "hit the restart button on the 21st century'' and get back to an agenda that will
assure America's place as an "innovation superpower." "The fire that was sparked here in this valley has made such a
difference," she told the sold-out crowd of 200 leading chief executives at the Silicon Valley Leadership group's 2007
CEO Business Climate Summit at Applied Materials in Santa Clara. "But it can't just be allowed to sputter out."  San
Francisco Chronicle: Clinton pushes innovation to Silicon Valley leadership

DODD SHIFTS TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN LATEST AD: Democratic presidential candidate Christopher Dodd released a new
television advertisement Thursday in Iowa, emphasizing his concern about global warming. The ad represents a shift in
his campaign, which has focused its first two television ads to a discussion of the war in Iraq. The new ad started
Thursday on network stations statewide in both Iowa and New Hampshire and is expected to run over the next week, said
Taylor West, a representative for Dodd's campaign. His first television ad criticized his fellow Democrats in Congress,
with Dodd saying they hadn't joined him in his efforts to "take away the president's blank check and setting a
timetable to bring troops home." Des Moines Register: Dodd's latest television ad focuses on global warming

HAVE A PROBLEM?  MEASURE IT, SAYS RUDY: If it worked in New York, it can work anywhere, Rudy Giuliani said yesterday,
promising to apply the stat-driven problem-fighting approach he used in City Hall to the federal government if he's
elected President. Giuliani, who as mayor pushed use of Compstat by the NYPD to track and drive down city crime,
proposed a whole new line of stat-like offspring, in what amounted to his first policy rollout of his candidacy. There
would be Borderstat, Terrorstat, Fedstat, even the somewhat ungainly Homeland Securitystat in a Giuliani White House,
the former mayor said. "You can take the Compstat principles," he said during a charts-and-graphs presentation at the
Sheraton Hotel and Towers in midtown, "and apply them to almost any agency of the government." New York Daily News:
Rudy would get on crime, stat!

OBAMA ON THE COURT: From John F. Kennedy's sailing to Bill Clinton's golf mulligans to John Kerry's windsurfing, sports
has been used, correctly or incorrectly, as a personality decoder for presidents and presidential aspirants. So,
armchair psychologists and fans of athletic metaphors, take note: Barack Obama is a wily player of pickup basketball,
the version of the game with unspoken rules, no referee and lots of elbows. He has been playing since adolescence, on
cracked-asphalt playgrounds and at exclusive health clubs, developing a quick offensive style, a left-handed jump shot
and relationships that have extended into the political arena. New York Times: One Place Where Obama Goes Elbow to
Elbow http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/01/us/politics/01hoops.html

VIDAL WHO? ASKS OBAMA CAMP: Anyone who has struggled with split ends or unruly hair knows who Vidal Sassoon is. The
Barack Obama campaign had to ask. The iconic hair stylist is among hundreds of political donors who provided incomplete
information with their contributions to presidential candidates during the first three months of this year. Of the $130
million raised in the first quarter, the campaigns collected $13 million from donors who failed to list their
occupations and their employers as required by law, according to an analysis of campaign records by The Associated
Press. The campaigns are now obligated to ask, though they are not required to obtain the information. Under Federal
Election Commission rules, they have 30 days to employ their "best efforts" to secure complete reports. AP via Yahoo!
News: Some donors keep data to themselves http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070531/ap_on_el_pr/donors_no_data

WHERE DOES WES CLARK STAND ON '08? As of Feb. 2, retired Gen. Wesley Clark seemed to be running for president. "I think
we need a president who understands that to project strength and earn respect is to be strong and show respect," he
told the Democratic National Committee's Winter Meeting. The meeting was a cattle call at which he spoke along with
nine other Democrats who were all actually running, and Clark did seem to be talking about himself. But in the months
since then, any sense of momentum behind his still-undeclared candidacy has seemed to vanish without a trace. "I
haven't said I won't run," Clark told Politico.com. "I think about running every single day."  The Politico: Wes Clark
plays field as '08 hopes fade http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0507/4262.html
