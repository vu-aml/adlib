I don't think it's out yet.  Lemme check.  As soon as it's out, I'll get it around.  Hope all's well under the circumstances.
 
Best,
Jeff

We are scheduled to meet with PG&E to discuss their plan of reorganization for gas on Jan. 8th at 10 AM CST.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Best, 
Jeff
