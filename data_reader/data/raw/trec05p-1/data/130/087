Hi Angela,

It was great seeing you in class this afternoon.  Keep
up the good work! Here is some information about my
Pilates studio as well as Pilates in general. Private
sessions in the studio are much different than the
mass mat class. At Powerhouse Pilates, I will design a
workout specifically for your body. We will focus on
your problem areas and we will increase your overall
strength and flexibility using all of the Pilates
equipment.

1. The benefits of Pilates

Pilates strengthens your abdominals, tightens your
buttocks, improves your posture, corrects your
alignment, reduces stress, alleviates lower back pain
and neck pain, strengthens and tones your muscles
without building bulk, and lengthens your body as a
whole. It helps you look and feel great, gives you a
sense of ease and confidence, and helps you feel
grounded and centered at all times.

2. Location

Powerhouse Pilates
1117 Omar St.
Houston, Texas 77009

Powerhouse is located in the Houston Heights, just 10
minutes from downtown Houston. From downtown, take
Allen Parkway to Studemont and turn right on
Studemont. Turn left on Omar and it's in the first
block on the left.

3. Hours of Operation:

Monday-Friday: 7am to 9pm
Saturday: 8am to 2pm

4. Cost:

Private session: $65 per session
Duet: $50 per person

Series cards are also available and can bring the cost
of a private session down to as low as $50 per
session. Duets are Pilates sessions with two students
and one instructor. If you know someone who is
interested in Pilates, you might consider bringing
them in so that you can work out together. If you buy
a duet series card, the price can be as low as $37.50
per person per session.

Series Cards:

Ten private sessions: $550 (save $100)
Fifteen private sessions: $800 (Save $175)
Twenty private sessions: $1000 (save $300)

Ten duet sessions: $425 (save $75)
Fifteen duet sessions: $600 (save $150)
Twenty duet sessions: $750 (save $250)

5. Payment methods:

We accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, checks,
and cash.

6. Scheduling

Appointments are scheduled on the hour and are fifty
minutes long. You will work on all of the Pilates
equipment and your instructor will develop a Pilates
routine specifically for your body.

7. Credentials
