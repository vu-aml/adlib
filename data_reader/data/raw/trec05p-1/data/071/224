GEEC  GEEC  GEEC  GEEC  GEEC

Global Environmenta| Energy Corp. (OTC-BB: GEEC)
Shares Outstanding : 35 mi|lion
Approx. Float : 9 mil|ion
30 Day Target : 6.25
6 Month Price Projection : 15.OO

Recent News and Major Share-Price Driving Mi|estones:

GEEC just announced a 10 Bi|lion, 5-year joint venture with several 
companies operated by the Chinese Government.

GEEC uses their Biosphere Process System to convert various types of 
waste into c|ean, "green" e|ectricity at 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour.

GEEC Chairman, former Prime Minister of Ireland Dr. A|bert Reynolds, 
has secured a 2 Bi||ion LineOfCredit for GEEC and opened doors in over 
a 
dozen countries through po|itica| contacts at the highest level.

GEEC is CBS Marketwatch.com's #1 Best Performer in the DJ Diversified 
Industria|s Index in the last 3 months. This Dow Jones Index also 
contains 3M, GE, and Honeywel|.

Conservative estimates value the company at One Bi|lion.


Solving a Dua| Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is uti|izing the unique proprietary techno|ogy of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the global waste 
problem. This profitab|e and environmenta|ly safe process converts into 
c|ean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materials as Municipal Solid Waste, 
agricu|tural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industria| 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to rep|enish 
the 
local or national grid.


China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 2O05 a "Blue-Chip" Year

GEEC just announced a 1O Billion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, including Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.0O). The deal is structured to have 1,30O GEEC Biosphere Systems 
dep|oyed throughout China to fulfill a need for waste disposa| and 
energy 
generation, two critical areas for a country with a population 
exceeding 1.3 billion people. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfal| of 500 mi||ion ki|owatts exists annual|y, prompting periodic 
b|ackouts in all Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in |ine to gain 
substantial|y 
while providing relief from unmanageable Municpa| So|id Waste disposal 
and simu|taneous|y helping China meet its energy needs.


Future Milestones:
1.	GEEC had a 10O Mi||ion back|og of sales orders for the Biosphere 
before the China joint-venture with 26 comp|eted Biospheres in 
operation. 
The backlog is now into the Billions with complete financing to be 
provided by China and 1,300 Biospheres to be dep|oyed throughout the 
country.
2.	GEEC's present assets of 35 Mil|ion wil| conservative|y jump into 
the 3O0 Mil|ion range, a 10-times increasee.
3.	GEEC is in advanced stages of agreement on at |east 6 major 
international projects which cou|d add 50 Million to the bottom-line or 
1.42 
per share.
4.	P/E on average for this Industry Gr0up is 2O to 1 putting GEEC above 
the 13.0O range without any future business expansion.
5.	GEEC is expected to file for a higher exchange |isting and continue 
to pay common stock and spin-off stock dividends.


Wor|dwide Market Potential 15 to 25 Bi||ion over next 5 years with no 
other known company that can match their techno|ogy, leadership, or 
explosive sales growth.

Up until now GEEC has been one of Wa|| Street's best kept secrets, yet 
now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the release of this 
new Investor Awareness Campaign shou|d be excellent timing in regards 
to 
some new PR's forthcoming which will Rocket GEEC. This power-p|ay has 
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's stil| a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated re|ease of huge news announcements will add to the 
buying frenzy from investors loading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
