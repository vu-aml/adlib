Attached is the 4th floor excel file to be able to assign seats for the estate churn.  The churn date will be Thursday Jan 31.  Fallon's team has asked that the desks be assigned in sequential order.  Can you guys divide the list and get a churn in by noon tomorrow for the guys I sent you earlier?  Please??
They should only be churning phones (turrets don't leave the floor), CPU's, boxes, palms etc.  Key board and mice should remain here.

If there are any additional names that should be added please let me know and add them to the churn.

Please let me know ASAP if there are any problems as these churns affect the churns we're trying to roll behind.  

Thanks!!!
Tammy
