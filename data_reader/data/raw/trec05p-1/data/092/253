No, we have not heard from the Office again.  Word has it that the Minister will soon be relieved of his duties, and hopefully the whole issue will be buried.   I will keep you posted.

Richard,

As per Michael's request, in order to preserve the confidential nature of the matter, I am sending you Guido Tawil's invoice for his work in reference to the recent Anti-Corruption Office request for information. 

Best Regards,


Andrea
