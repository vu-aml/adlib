CONGRATULATIONS!!!

This lottery is a promotional program by DE LOTTO, (Biggest lottery Organization in the Netherlands) to advertise to the world its existence. All participants were selected through a computer ballot system drawn from over 50,000 companies and 2,000,000 individual email addresses from all over the world, as part of our international promotions program, which we intend to conduct several times a year.

Due to the possibility of unscrupulous individuals filing a double claim, we suggest that you keep this award strictly confidential until your claim has been processed and notarized and your certificate of award obtained. This is in conformity with the lottery claim regulations by our Organization & the Netherlands Gaming Control Board. 
This is part of our security protocol measures to avoid double claiming and unwarranted abuse of this program by some participants/non participants. 

All winnings must be claimed not later than 24th July 2005. After this date all unclaimed funds will be included in the next stake. Anybody under the age of 18 is automatically disqualified.

So you are to act fast in the claiming of your funds, for delays will compel us to disperse your funds, in other words, we shall divert your funds as stated above.
