Jim, i suggest that the group includes Exelon (Jack Crowley), Constellation (Harvey Reed), Edison Mission Energy (Reem Fahey), Reliant (John Orr), Duke (Mike Gildea or Lee Barrett), Mirant (Jim Mayhew), PG&E (Richard Doying) and Cinergy (Dennis Flaherty).  Some of these parties may not be supportive but would appreciate being contacted (which at least opens up the communications channel for NG).  

I suggest that NG make contact with the executives rather than Enron (we need to continue to hedge our position, the old no fingerprints approach)...

cheers
Mike

When you have the list of customers we should contact, please let me know.  I should try and get back with Ashley today.
