Dear Nora,

I just wanted you to be aware that you've missed 4 homework assignments
this trimester. Homework allows you to practice your skills, and it
keeps your average high since I only check homework for completion. I
would like you to set a goal for yourself to not miss any more
assignments. Also, remember that you can complete extra credit work to
substitute for missed assignments. :-)

Mrs. Ward
