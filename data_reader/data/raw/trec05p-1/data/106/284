This has been on my 'to do' list for a while, but wanted you to know formally that I very much enjoyed and appreciated your presentation at the ETS Operations Directors Conference. It is imperative Operations and Gas Logistics work together and stay aligned  in critical objectives. You continue to demonstrate why you are respected within the leadership ranks.

Thanks!
