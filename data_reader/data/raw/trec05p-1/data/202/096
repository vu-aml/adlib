SMILING is infectious, You catch it like the flu 
When someone SMILED at me today, I started SMILING too 
I passed around the corner and someone saw my grin 
When he SMILED, I realized I'd passed it on to him. 
I thought about that smile, then realized its worth, 
A single SMILE just like mine could travel 'round the earth. 
So if you feel a SMILE begin, don't leave it undetected. 

LET'S START AN EPIDEMIC QUICK AND GET THE WORLD INFECTED!

KEEP THE SMILE GOING BY SENDING THIS 
ON TO A FRIEND 
Everyone needs a smile !!
