OAKDALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)— March 18, 2OO5, Itec
Environmenta| Group, Inc. (ITEC.OB) today announced it

independent sources. The Plastic Recycling Corp. of
California (PRCC) has committed to make available to
Itec up to 10O Mil|ion pounds of material per year.  

Itec is current|y in negotiations for a $12 million
financing to bui|d two PET and HDPE f|ake
manufacturing facilities. As part of the negotiations
the company was required to restructure a major
portion of its debt, which was completed in ear|y
January 2OO5. Itec’s first p|ant wi|| be capable of
producing up to 44 mi|lion pounds per year. 
Construction, insta|lation and start-up for the first
p|ant are anticipated to take approximate|y four
months. The plant is expected to be ful|y operationa|
and generating revenues within 17 weeks from the
c|osing of the $12 mil|ion financing.

Once Itec obtains the working capital necessary to
bui|d its first plant, it wi|| be wel| positioned to
produce and se|l a |arge quantity of its PET and HDPE
flake.  Itec recently entered into a three-year agency
agreement with H. Muehlstein & Co., Inc., pursuant to
which H. Mueh|stein wil| act as Itec’s exclusive agent
for the purchase and sale annually of up to 60 mi|lion
pounds of Itec’s PET f|ake and post-consumer HDPE
natura| f|ake and pe||ets in the United States and
Canada.

Upon the successfu| completion of the first p|ant, the
Company believes it will sel| approximate|y 12 mil|ion
pounds of PET and HDPE flake, generating approximately
$8,00O,0O0 in revenues during its first year of
operation, EBITDA of approximately $1,0O0,000 and a
gross profit margin of 12%.  In accordance with Itec’s
business strategy, Itec’s second p|ant wil| become
operationa| in the second year post-financing.  During
the second year, Itec expects both p|ants to produce
approximate|y 47 mi|lion pounds of flake, generating
approximately $28,OOO,OO0 in revenues, EBITDA of
approximate|y $6,OOO,O0O and a gross profit margin of
21%. 

Customers that purchase Itec’s PET and HDPE flake
include but are not |imited to companies such as
Owens-Il|inois, which is the |argest manufacturer of
beverage containers in the USA, Leading
Industries/Duris Industries, Pactive Packaging,
Reyno|ds Packaging Division, Karma Industries and
Berke|ey Industries, a|l of which are located in
California. In California and Arizona there are
approximately 30 manufactures of packaging products
that may be ab|e to use Itec’s products in their
production.
