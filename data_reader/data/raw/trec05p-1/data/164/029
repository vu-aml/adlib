MEDIC AL INSURANCE
DRI provides a Medical, Vision and

Aetna Global Benefits
This is an international insurance 

company, which allows participants 

to
seek care from the provider of 

their choice throughout the world. 

The
Aetna Global Plan also allows 

access to a Preferred Provider
Organization (PPO) network, which 

results in a significant discount. 

The
In-network benefit has $10 co-pay 

and the out-of-network benefit has 

a
$150 Calendar year deductible per 

individual and $300 per family. 

After
the Deductible is met; the 

out-of-network benefit is 80%. IRC
International Staff do not have 

access to the PPO networks while 

they
are Overseas. For this reason, 

their benefit is 90% with no 

deductible.
While in

The US, International staff can 

either accesses the networks or 

receive
The discounted benefit or use 

out-of-network providers in the US 

and
receive an 80% benefit after the 

deductible.

Vision
Vision coverage is included under 

the Aetna Global Benefits Plan

or $15 co-pay. Prescriptions 

filled while overseas are 

reimbursed
through the medical plan at 90%.
