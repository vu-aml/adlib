Dear  , 

I am Barrister Martin Johnson, a solicitor at law. I am the personal 
attorney to Engr. Kenneth Edwards ,a  national of  USA, who used to work 
with Shell-development Company in Nigeria. Here in after shall be referred 
to as my client. On the 21st of April 2002, my client, his wife   were 
involved in a car accident along sagamu express road. All occupants of the 
vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. 

Since then I have made several enquiries to USA embassy to locate any of my 
clients extended relatives this has also proved unsuccessful. After these 
several unsuccessful attempts, to locate any member of his family hence I 
contacted you. 

I am contacting you to assist in repatriating the money and property left 
behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by 
the bank where this huge deposit were lodged.
Particularly, the finance company  where the deceased had an account valued 
at about US$10.5 million dollars has issued me a notice to provide the next 
of kin or have the account confiscated within the next ten official working 
days. 

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3years now 
I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since 
you are thesame foreigner with my client that is why i contacted, so that 
the proceeds of this account valued at US$10.5 million dollars can be paid 
to you and then you and me can share the money.I have all necessary legal 
documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. 

All I require is your honest cooperation to enableusseethis deal through.I 
guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that 
will protect you from any breach of the law.
And send to me your telephone and fax numbers to enable us discuss further 
about this transaction.
Yours Sincerly 

Best regards,
Barrister Margaret milakovich
