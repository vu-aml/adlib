NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Tony Martin <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at all this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. The Panthers secondary is one of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in deeper Fantasy leagues may be worth considering. 

Frank Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but he's expected to play on Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary h! as! n't been playing well of late, so giving Sanders some consideration in deeper leagues is advisable. 

David Boston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01
Boston has become one of the premier wide receivers in Fantasy Football. He's posted three touchdowns and 217 yards receiving in his last two games, and should have another solid game vs. San Diego in Week 11. 

Tom Brady <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=187741&>, QB NE - Martin Updated 11/21/01
Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick announced late Monday that Brady will remain the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season, barring injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe to a backup role and makes him useless from a Fantasy perspective. Brady might have his hands full passing against the Saints on Sunday, but he is a fairly safe weekly starter otherwise.

Dolphins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=15&>, DT MIA - Martin Updated 11/21/01
Defensive tackle Daryl Gardener could miss the remainder of the season due to a fragmented disc in his back. He will miss at least one month to rest and rehabilitate the injury before being re-evaluated. Gardener's absence hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, which might be burned a little more by opposing running backs in the upcoming weeks.
Marvin Minnis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Minnis is unlikely to be available for Sunday's game against Seattle due to the sprained ankle he suffered during a Nov. 11 game against the Jets. He will be replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup at split end, and you should keep him reserved for this week.

Mark Brunell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/21/01
Brunell's nagging leg injury might sideline him for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He decided about two hours before last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to a strained right quadriceps. Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he will start the game, so right now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as you set your lineups.

Fred Taylor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/21/01
Taylor received a second medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe groin injury could keep him out up to three months and possibly the remainder of the season, according to the Florida Times-Union. The diagnosis was that the injury still has not healed and will need more time to become healthy, and in the meantime Taylor has developed pain ! in! his hip, a side effect of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor will not play again this Fantasy season, although you should probably hold onto him until a final decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough bench.

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/21/01
Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enough for him to practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss Thursday's game against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravated it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith on your bench for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Broncos' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it would be prior to the season.

Shaun Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=187382&>, RB SEA - JWillie Updated 11/20/01
With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Alexander will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during their charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.

Tom Brady <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=187741&>, QB NE - Martin Updated 11/20/01
The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. "I don't see any changes this week," coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to your ! ro! ster as an insurance policy if you can.

Jonathan Quinn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=12632&>, QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game.

Ricky Watters <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times . He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.

Doug Flutie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 11/20/01
Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. "Doug is going to be our quarterback," he said. "You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next week." Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.

Mark Bruener <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&rando! m! =2125&key=1360&>, TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/20/01
Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.

Erron Kinney <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice early this week.

Frank Wycheck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01
Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.

Steve McNair <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any practice time this week. 

Derrick Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01
Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.

Marvin Minnis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start in his place,

Reggie Wayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.

Jerome Pathon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=12612&>, WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01
Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lineup. 

Jay Fiedler <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=12363&>, QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/20/01
Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``! Th! at's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01
Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. "We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see," Shanahan told the Denver Post. "If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in." 

Benjamin Gay  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=245054&>, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. "We'll try to get him involved in some of the games," Davis said. "We'll see." 

Kevin Lockett <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1765&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins. 

Jacquez Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=12405&>, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Green (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable. 

Terrell Owens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 11/20/01
Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.
