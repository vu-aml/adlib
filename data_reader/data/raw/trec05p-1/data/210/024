Dearest in the Lord.

I am the above name person from the Republic Of Senegal. I am married to
Dr Alfred Williams who worked with Senegalise Embassy in South Africa for=

nine years before he died in the year 2000. We were married for eleven ye=
ars
without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four
days. Before his death we were both born again Christians and we lived ha=
ppilly.

When my late husband was alive he secured $15Million (Fifteen Million U.S=
.
Dollars) with financial institution here in Cote D'Ivoire. Presently, thi=
s
money is still with the financial institution. But recently, my Doctor to=
ld
me that from all the test conducted on my health, I am not going to last
long, expecially, due to my cancer and stroke. But what disturbs me most
now is stroke. This have indeed put me into serious confussion.

Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to churches or
Christian Organization that will utilize this money specifically for the
work of God . I want a church or individual that will use this money to
fund churches, Orphanages, Widows, and the less priviledged ones. Also,
the propagation of the work of God, building and maintaining the house of=

God through this money, is very important.

The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I
took this bold decision because I don't have any child that will inherit
this money and my late husband relatives are not Christians. I don't want=

my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers, for their ow=
n
selfish interest and in an ungodly manner. I am not afraid of death hence=

I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of th=
e
Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall
hold my peace.

I am presently in one hospital here in Abidjan Called (Apex Medical Centr=
e)
receiving some treatment.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Finan=
cial
institution in Ivory coast. I will also give you all information regardin=
g
the deposit of this money. I will also issue you a letter of authority th=
at
will empower you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you an=
d
your church to always pray for me because God work in misterious ways. My=

happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Who ever that wan=
ts
to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. I will also want yo=
u
to speak with me through the Hospital telephone number which I will give
to you as soon as I hear from you. Please always be prayerful all through=

your life.

Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or chr=
istian
individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act acco=
rdingly
as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you soon. Please reply me through=

this mail  goodnessgod1@yahoo.com

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.
Yours in Christ,
Mrs  Goodness H. Alfred Williams
