Do you know if the rest of these auto-terminations apply to all deals we have with this counterparties, or just certain deals?  Please look into them and let me know as soon as possible.

Kimberly,/Rhonda --  (1) As mentioned on a voicemail to Rhonda, the 1996 Modesto  enabling agreement (96000724) does not have auto termination while the 1999 Enabling agreement does. Can you give Stacey White guidance as to the transactions under each?  Thanks.
