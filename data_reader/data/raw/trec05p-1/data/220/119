Hey guys, Kevin Presto would like to add the Legal Plan "Comprehensive" coverage option if its not to late.  His form will be in the stack of information arriving at your office today.

Thanks, Tony

Tony -

I received a voicemail from Kevin Presto stating that he forgot to elect Legal plan coverage - he would like the comprehensive plan.

Can you please add this?  I understand through Jeanie that the copies were all sent to Stamford on Friday.

Thanks!
Amy
