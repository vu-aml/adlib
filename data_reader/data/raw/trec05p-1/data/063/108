                   Under Start > Programs > Business Applications > LIM, Use the latest MIMIC version which is MIMIC 1.2.7
 
        
        Excel Addin:
    
                    Please reinstall your add-in, running the XMIM Excel User (installation) under Start > Programs > Business Applications > LIM
