any atom of success.

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his last =
name over the INTERNET, to locate any member of his family, hence I con=
tact you to assists in repatriating the sums of$22.3 million DOLLARS my=
 boss deposited with the security company here in Republic of Nigeria b=
efore his untimely death with his families.

The security company were my Boss lodged this money have issued me a no=
tice to provide the Next Of Kin to my Boss before the money gets confis=
cated or declare unserviceable by the security company, within the next=

relatives for over six months now.

I seek your transparent consent to present you as the next of kin of th=
e deceased ,so that the proceeds of this money can be delivered to you =
at your home country by the security company. As a personal assistance =
to my dead Boss I have all the document of deposit to back up the claim=
 of the money from the security company.

o enable us see the deal through. I guarantee that this will be execute=
d under lagete mate arrangement and transparency.

Hence an attorney will provide neecessary legal documents that can be u=
sed to back up all the claims, Finally could you inform me of your acce=
ptance to carryout this deal with me, I shall in turn tell you the code=
 and batch number my deceases Boss deposited the money with the securit=
