They've already called Paul Lucci.   The problem is this deal was done by Nicole Cortez (who is no longer with us) back in June of last year to Western Natural Gas/Aurora .  (Which exact company we don't know...... Trouble is that Aurora no longer exists and I'm not sure if Western Natural does either.   Credit was talking to Paul this morning and I'll have to track him down to see how their conversation ended).

I'll keep you posted.

Yes, I need you to put in a deal for this transaction.  Our cumulative imbalance is off from PSCO by 1,000 mmbtu's.
Let me know when it's out there.  Thanks, Gloria

Gloria,
I am faxing to you an Imbalance Trade Request form which I sent in to PSCO on June 19, 2000 for a volume of 1,000.  We traded this imbalance with Western Natural Gas / Aurora Nat. Gas.

Nicole Cortez from our office (who is no longer here) would have input the deal.  I am trying to find any notes because I don't see a deal in the system.  The only inclination of a note I have is a price of $3.65 which I think would be the NWPL index for June.

Let me know if you want me to put in a deal for this transaction.

Gloria, 

I questioned your e-mail because you referred to the 06/00 statement and then referred to the market list for 06/01.  I didn't know what year you were talking about.  I have the statement you left for me and I have no idea what this is all about.  We did not ship in June, 2001, however I believe that Theresa in the Denver office did.  I will check with her and have her get back to you.  Please be aware that she is busy with COGA this week so it may be the end of the week or possibly next week.

Jackie

Jackie - can you please schedule this for 06/00 production?  Please let me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118

   1)   On the 06/00 statement, Public Service is showing an imbalance swap (delivery to Aurora Natural Gas).
         For 1,000 dth.  I do not see Aurora Natural Gas in the Market List for 06/01.
