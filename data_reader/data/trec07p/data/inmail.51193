OK, I modprobed like I said for snd_emu10k1, and snd_pcm_oss.
my /dev/dsp device was tossed, so I got that back, with mknod /dev/dsp c 14
3, because mplayer likes to have that around.
I don't get errors, but I also don't get any sound, so I guess it's sorta a
love hate type thing.
Any suggestions?

Thanks,
