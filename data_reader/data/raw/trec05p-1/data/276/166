Enron's remaining Astro's tickets and parking passes are now available for purchase for individual games through June via an on-line auction. As we progress through the season, we'll add the rest of the games to the site. Participation in the auction will require registration, easily accomplished through the site link at <http://auction.corp.enron.com/>. Auctions for this weekend's games will conclude at 11:00 a.m. this Friday. For future games, the auctions will conclude at 5:00 p.m. three business days prior to the game. Please call Elizabeth Linnell or Ryan Seleznov if you have any questions.
