Harry and Brandon:
 
Just to memorialize what I just communicated to Harry over the phone.  My interface at TVA emailed yesterday requesting a phone dialogue to discuss where our Synthetic Peaker offer needs to be for TVA to execute.  Holding all assumptions constant, we would need to come in between $2.25-$2.30/KW-month in order for TVA to execute.  Our indicative quote was $3.90/KW-month.  I will attempt to find out if they have other offers in the sub-$2.50 range or if they are just setting their own bid at the requested price.
