Gil:

Will you be handling the documentation?  Does JSB Asset, LLC have an authorized trader list? a resolution to open the account?

Subject:	Sale of Catalytica Shares by JSB Asset LLC

 Yesterday we entered into a trade with CSFB for the block sale of our shares of common stock of Catalytica, a public company.  The shares are held in JSB Asset LLC. We now have to set up an account with CSFB on behalf of JSB Asset, LLC to consummate  the sale of our shares in Catalytica.  PLease note that the trade occurred yesterday so we are now in documentation stage.  We will most likely terminate the account immediately upon conclusion of the transaction.

 Brenda and Joel--any problems with us setting up an account with CSFB for JSB Asset LLC?

Also note that I ran this by our internal and external counsel handling the investigations and these transactions in Catalytica do not create any issues relevant to the investigation.

Hey,

We have decided that it would be best to set up an account at CSFB.  I think you guys are already working on everything else, but we will need to additionally complete the customer account agreement and W-9.  Once everything is complete, can you please send me copies for our records.  

Also, we are still pending an okay from Donna Lowry.

Thanks!
Aneela
:-)
