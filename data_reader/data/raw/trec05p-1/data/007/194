kevin-
unfortuanely most of these are analysts- some of the language is ok to use, but more qualitative than quantitative - this was jsut sent to us - most of them are in house, so be careful if you are printing out anyof them.
 
and i have added in this resume of this guy (trey shenken) who sent me his to show to hunter- i gave it directly to hr as i don't know the guy from adam- he was a frd of a frd and i think his is WAY to long, but had some stuff abt trading:
spk soon rz
