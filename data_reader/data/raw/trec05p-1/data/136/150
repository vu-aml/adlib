Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4638&key=1003&"><B>Jake Plummer</B></A>, QB ARI - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit.

Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4638&key=1171&"><B>Warrick Dunn</B></A>, RB TB - President Taft <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks.

FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again.

Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout.
