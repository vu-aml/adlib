Maggie,
 
I am confused.  My e-mail is Michael.E.Taylor@enron.com <mailto:Michael.E.Taylor@enron.com>    I am looking for the website that allows me to take deravitive classes and risk management, etc.   I am in Global Markets, not EEs.  Am looking in the right place?
 
Mike

Actually the below login and password are incorrect.  We merged with EES Training department and we had to migrate systems also.  You can login to our new website elm.enron.com and your new username is your email address: michael.taylor@enron.com <mailto:michael.taylor@enron.com> and password: birthdate (mmddyyyy)
 
If you have trouble finding the class you want let me know.  I'll help you from the backend.
 
Maggie
