DON HENLEY AND TRAIN
TO HEADLINE TIGER JAM V 
PRESENTED BY COCA-COLA 
AT MANDALAY BAY IN LAS VEGAS
SATURDAY, APRIL 20th 


Los Angeles, CA (March 4, 2002)-The Tiger Woods Foundation announced
today that Grammy-award winning artists Don Henley and Train will
perform at the Tiger Jam V benefit concert presented by Coca-Cola and
hosted by Tiger Woods.  The fifth annual event will take place on April
20, 2002, at 8:30 PM in the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas,
Nev.  The benefit concert will once again raise and distribute funds for
the Tiger Woods Foundation and children's charities based in Las Vegas
and Los Angeles.  

"I am very excited to have both Don Henley and Train as part of Tiger
Jam V," stated Tiger Woods.  "I have been a fan of Don's for a long
time, and Train is a band whose sound I really love.  I'm looking
forward to seeing both of their performances and I know they will help
make Tiger Jam V a memorable evening."

Tickets for the concert will be going on sale to the general public
beginning Sunday, March 10, 2002, and can be purchased through
Ticketmaster Charge-By-Phone lines at (702) 474-4000, at all
Ticketmaster retail ticket centers, via www.ticketmaster.com, and at the
Mandalay Bay Box Office. Individual ticket prices start at $45.  VIP
events will be held before and following the concert - packages begin at
$1,500.

An ardent supporter of the Walden Woods project, which has raised over
30 million dollars to preserve Walden Pond and support the Thoreau
Institute, Don Henley has had a long and successful music career.  As a
founding member of the Eagles, Henley won four Grammy awards, topped the
album charts five times and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame.  Henley's first three solo efforts produced numerous hits,
including "Dirty Laundry", "All She Wants to do is Dance," and "The
Heart of the Matter," as well as a Grammy award for Best Rock Vocals.  

"Drops Of Jupiter," the title track from Train's multi-platinum second
album, recently won two trophies--Best Rock Song and Best Instrumental
Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s)--at the 2002 Grammy Awards
ceremony. The San Francisco-based Train has earned a reputation as one
of the hottest live bands in the country having performed hundreds of
gigs--including slots on the Matchbox Twenty tour and high-profile
television performances on "The Late Show with David Letterman," "The
Tonight Show with Jay Leno," the 2002 Grammys and the 2002 Winter
Olympics--since the release of the group's self-titled debut album in
February 1998.  Driven in part by the band's breakthrough single, the
Top Ten hit "Meet Virginia," the band's self-titled first album was
certified platinum in March 2000.

Proceeds from Tiger Jam V will be used to support the many programs
funded throughout the year by the Tiger Woods Foundation.  Charities
that received funding from Tiger Jam IV include Child Haven, Center for
Independent Living, Greater Las Vegas Inner City Games, Las Vegas
Chamber of Commerce Foundation, Southern Nevada Inner City Youth Golf
Association, Las Vegas Founders' Club Golf Foundation, Children of the
Night, Starlight Children's Foundation, GRAMMY in the Schools and VH1
Save the Music Foundation.

Established in 1996 by Tiger Woods and his father Earl, the Tiger Woods
Foundation empowers young people to reach their highest potential by
initiating and supporting community-based programs that promote the
health, education and welfare of all of America's children.  Through
junior golf clinics, motivational speeches, educational programs, the
support of local heroes and benevolent giving, the Foundation has
interacted with over 85,000 kids across America.

The Coca-Cola Company is the official community sponsor and beverage
sponsor of the Tiger Woods Foundation, and the title sponsor of two
major annual fundraising activities- the Tiger Jam benefit concert, and
the series of Coca-Cola/Tiger Woods Foundation Junior Golf Clinics.

The four-star Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino celebrates its third
anniversary this Spring, continuing its tradition of elegance and
excitement as one of the top resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. Well known
for its diverse array of top entertainment offerings, the Mandalay Bay
Events Center regularly plays host to a wide range of events, including
concerts by opera sensations the Three Tenors and Andrea Bocelli,
popular music stars Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan, and has become the
premiere venue of choice for world championship boxing events. Tiger Jam
V on April 20th marks the third time Mandalay Bay plays host to Tiger
Jam.
