All of the EOL deals are included in this assignment. This assignment agreement template we have is EOL specific.  If you could forward us a template for non-EOL, we will take care of that deal separately, or you can adjust this agreement to account for all deals.

Hi, Joe:

Tana said I should forward this e-mail to you and that you guys would prepare the assignment and send to us for review.  Let me know if this is not the case.  Please note that all of the deals, with the exception of the first one, are EOL deals.

Thanks for your help.

Marie

Please prepare trade assignment documentation for the following deals (please note that all of these deals, except for the first one, were executed on EOL):

VT2401.1

Also, ENA does not have an ISDA in place with the counterparty--all deals were confirmed under GTC's.  Please give me a call if you need any other info.

Thanks again,
