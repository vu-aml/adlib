Sorry bout the first comment, did not totally understand... We will handle this via the OA process, where I'm working with the OA group that will allow us a bucket of income or loss and we will run this through Tom's P&L... This will be a pass through for Tom's book... O

OW, 

What do you think about the orig deduct?  How do we usually handle orig on something like this?

Megan

As I mentioned to you yesterday, it still looks like the volumes for gas delivered to TX GLO do not have Linda Robert's origination fee deducted.  Do we need to execute a PMA with TXGLO to deduct those volumes from the next delievery?

Also isn't there an entry that is missing in your file to capture the $ cost of gas for the gas delivered to TXGLO?  Is that being captured in Unify or is it being manually entered by Gas Accounting?

Darren
Do we need to execute a seperate deal ticket for the origination deduct?

Susan/Laynie
What busines unit are these cost centers rolling up to (11814 & 27117?)

Eric:
I reviewed the gas deals on Franks' spreadsheet and they agree with what is in Sitara.  As soon as I have the October gas numbers, I will forward them to you.

Attached is a spreadsheet of the TGLO deals booked to the GL to help you with our current settlement position.  It is divided by debit/credit entries.  When the sales are booked, a debit hits the customer account to create the open sale to apply the cash to and a credit hits the revenue account (40004000 third party; 40005000 intercompany) for the profit center.  

Below is a summary of where we are on the sale dollars to EGM.  I have already sent an email to risk to update the demand fees for the prior months and to book Aug and Sept crude.  I will wait for the go ahead from Frank before I final them to the GL.    Let me know if you have any questions.
