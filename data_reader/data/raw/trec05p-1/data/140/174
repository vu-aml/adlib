MEMORANDUM
TO:
EPSA Members
FROM:
Lynne H. Church, President
DATE:
November 20, 2001
RE:
2002 Committee & Working Group Chairs
Please join me in congratulating the following EPSA committee and working group chairs for 2002. Their tenure will take effect in January 2002.
You will note that there will no longer be a Power Marketers Working Group. That group was organized four years ago to assure that issues of interest to marketers were covered. Since that time both our membership and the nature of the issues has changed. Most of our Board and Associate level members now have marketing operations, and issues concerning market development are in the forefront. At this point, having such a subgroup within the Regulatory Affairs Committee causes a lot of confusion.
For this reason, the Executive Committee agreed with Julie Simon's and my recommendation to disband the working group after 2001. At the same time, we recommended establishing a vice chair, since the purview of the committee is so broad.
