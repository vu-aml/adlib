Happy Holidays everyone!

To celebrate this festive time of year Elizabeth and I
will be hosting a wonderful holiday bash at our house
inviting you all to partake in the merriment and
drinking!

When  : Saturday Dec 22  - 7:00 pm.
Where : 2118 Glen Knoll / Houston / 77077 (map below)
What  : Dinner and festivities.
Contact : (H)281.531.4480 (Mobile)713.628.0170

Please feel free to bring drinks and food.  We'll be
cooking you all a fabulous vegetarian Christmas feast!

Please RSVP if you plan to come, and pass this
invitation on to others as we couldn't find everyone's
email addresses (josh&ann etc)

If you are coming through Houston to head to the great
state of Louisiana during this weekend as we expect
many of you are, feel free to plan on staying the
night at our house to break your long journey.  We've
got plenty of space; just let us know ahead of time.

Love,

Dave & Liz
