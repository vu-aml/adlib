Net Generation Year-to-Date 2001

During the first 4 months of the year, total U.S. net generation of 
electricity was 1,214 billion kilowatthours, 2.3 percent more than 
the amount reported during the corresponding period in 2000.  More 
than half (53 percent) of the generation was produced by coal-fired 
plants.  This was followed by 20 percent from nuclear, 14 percent from 
gas, 6 percent from hydro, 4 percent from petroleum, and 2 percent from 
other renewables.

Net Generation and Utility Retail
Sales-April 2001

Net Generation.  Total U.S. net generation of electricity was 282 
billion kilowatthours, 1 percent more than the amount reported in 
April 2000. Electric utilities generated 200 billion kilowatthours 
(71 percent of the total) and nonutility power producers generated 
82 billion kilowatthours (29 percent of total generation).  At 
utilities, fossil fuels (primarily coal) accounted for 73 percent 
of net generation, followed by 19 percent from nuclear, and 8 percent 
from renewable resources (including hydro).  At nonutilities, fossil 
fuels (primarily coal) accounted for 68 percent of total generation, 
followed by 21 percent from nuclear, and 11 percent from renewables 
(including hydro).

Utility Retail Sales. Total sales of electricity to ultimate consumers 
in the United States were 255 billion kilowatthours, 8 billion 
kilowatthours (3 percent) more than the amount reported in April 2000.
The residential sector had sales of 83 billion kilowatthours, 10 
percent more than the amount reported in April 2000.  Retail sales 
in the commercial sector were 6 percent higher while sales in the 
industrial sector were 5 percent lower than amounts reported a year 
ago.

Utility Fuel Receipts, Costs, and
Quality-March 2001

Coal. Receipts of coal at electric utilities totaled 64 million  
short  tons, down 5 million short tons from the
level reported in 
March 2000.  The decrease from the prior year level is due partly 
to the sale and reclassification of utility plants as nonutility 
plants.  Plants recently reclassified as nonutility and no longer 
required to report fuel receipts on the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC) Form 423 include those operated by Atlantic City 
Electric Company, Baltimore Gas & Electric Company, Cajun Electric 
Power Cooperative, Central Hudson Gas & Electric Company, Duquesne 
Light Company, PECO Energy, Pennsylvania Power & Light Company, 
Potomac Edison Company, Potomac Electric Power Company, and Public 
Service Electric & Gas Company of New Jersey.  In addition, data for 
the Tennessee Valley Authority was not available at the time of 
publication and is not included in this report.  

Petroleum.  Receipts of petroleum totaled 10 million barrels, up 
nearly 6 million barrels from the level reported in March 2000. While 
the sale and reclassification of plants has reduced fuel oil receipts 
over the past year, this increase in petroleum receipts is due partly 
to utilities switching from natural gas to a less expensive fuel oil 
as a replacement fuel. Also, the increase in consumption of fuel oil 
during December through February required some rebuilding of stocks. 
The average delivered cost of fuel oil was $4.20 per million Btu, up 
from $4.03 per million Btu reported in March 2000.

Gas.  Receipts of gas totaled 142 billion cubic feet (Bcf), down from 
191 Bcf reported in March  2000.  The average cost of gas delivered 
to electric utilities was $5.74 per million Btu, compared to $2.93 per 
million Btu reported in March 2000.  As with coal and petroleum, the 
sale and reclassification of electric plants is having a large effect 
on gas receipt data presented at the New England, Middle Atlantic, and 
Pacific Contiguous Census Divisions, as well as at the National level.

   sample; see Technical Notes for a discussion of the sample design
   for the Form EIA-759; 2000 estimates have been adjusted to reflect
   the Form EIA-759 census data and are final; see Technical Notes
   for adjustment methodology.
      3/  Includes petroleum coke.
      4/  Represents total pumped storage facility production minus
   energy used for pumping. Pumping energy used at pumped storage
   plants for April 2001  was 2,326 million kilowatthours.
      5/  The April 2001 petroleum coke consumption was 53,224 short
   tons for electric utilities and 307,009 short tons for
   nonutilities.
      6/  The April 2001 petroleum coke stocks were 140,428 short
tons.

   estimates based on a cutoff model sample; see Technical Notes for
   a discussion of the sample design for the Form EIA-826.  See
   Technical Notes for the adjustment methodology.  Retail revenue
   and retail average revenue per kilowatthour do not include taxes
   such as sales and excise taxes that are assessed on the consumer
   and collected through the utility.  Retail sales and net
   generation may not correspond exactly for a particular month for a
   variety of reasons (i.e., sales data may include purchases of
   electricity from nonutilities or imported electricity). Net
   generation is for the calendar month while retail sales and
   associated revenue accumulate from bills collected for periods of
   time (28 to 35 days) that vary dependent upon customer class and
   consumption occur-ring in and outside the calendar month.
      8/  Includes public street and highway lighting, other sales to
   public authorities, sales to railroads and railways, sales to
   farms for irrigation, and interdepartmental sales.
      9/  Values are preliminary for 2001 and final for 2000.
      10/  The March 2001 petroleum coke receipts were 121,499 short
tons.
      11/  Average cost of fuel delivered to electric generating
plants;  cost values are weighted values.
      12/  March 2001 petroleum coke cost was  72.6  cents per
million Btu.
      13/  Includes small amounts of coke-oven, refinery, and
blast-furnace gas.

difference calculation is not meaningful.

   rounding.  ×kWh=kilowatthours, and Mcf=thousand cubic feet.
