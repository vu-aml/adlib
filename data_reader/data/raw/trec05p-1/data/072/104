Great.  I wanted to get your thoughts on articulating the HR Risk Management area.  I will plug in your points and we can fine tune tomorrow.

Hi, Andrea,
 
I think this captures most everything on Jordan's slide -- it looks good.  
 
One thought -- I kind of believe that the bullet on governmental relationships may not really be "compliance," as it is more of what Kean's group would do.  If we are going to have a heading called "compliance," then I believe that we should add bullets on updating, publicizing, and striving for AAP targets, audits of compensation at all levels (which is where the OFCCP audit came from), audits of other employment practices (e.g., staffing, PRC, promotions, layoffs, etc.), risk management processes in termination of employment, and other related items.  This should be a combination of compliance, government relations, and legal.  Perhaps we call is HR Risk Mitigation/management instead???  (I don't really have the answers/context, so it may not be appropriate).
 
Thanks for the opportunity to comment.
 
Michelle

Dear all, 
Attached is a draft document titled  'Enron Diversity Overview'.  It is a consolidation of the major diversity efforts at Enron.  If you are aware of other diversity efforts, please let me know.  The first two areas listed have been the focus of the Diversity Sub-Committee.   

I have requested an update from the owners of the other areas and hope to have this updated by our 2:45 p.m. meeting.
