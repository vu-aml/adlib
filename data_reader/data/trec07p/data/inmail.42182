Making news today...

* Speaker Nancy Pelosi will present a plan to House Democrats for a war funding bill that won't include a timeline for
withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq but will feature benchmarks with consequences.

Full story on CNN.com: http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/05/22/war.funding/index.html

Democrats "backed down in the standoff with the White House over war funds, abandoning their veto-instigating
effort..." (Washington Times)

"Democratic leaders ceded significant ground to the White House..." (Roll Call)

"The decision to back down was a wrenching reversal for leading Democrats, who saw their election triumph in November
as a call to force an end to the war." (New York Times)

"Outraged" anti-war Democrats "criticized the decision." Rep. Jim Moran (D-VA): "We've given everything away... It will
split the Democratic caucus." (Bloomberg)

* Former Sen. John Edwards (D-NC) will give what aides describe as a "muscular speech" on the U.S. and terrorism today
before the Council of Foreign Relations in New York City, CNN's Candy Crowley reports.

Aides say Edwards will outline principles for when the U.S. should go into a country (following a terrorist attack),
how you go in, and with what expertise.

"It's not just about using the blunt instrument of the army," an aide said.

Edwards will also talk about modernizing the U.S. military to face current threats.

* "Sen. Joseph Biden's (D-Del.) call for a Democratic debate 'focused solely on ending the war in Iraq' was answered
this week" by an invitation to candidates from Johns Hopkins' School of Advanced International Studies, "but he might
be the only person who attends." (The Hill)

[Insert loquacious Biden joke here]

* Deborah Jeane Palfrey "would rather be called the 'Washington Madam' than 'D.C. Madam.' Why? 'It's a little
classier.'" (Examiner)

And Palfrey, a self-described "conservative Democrat," is throwing her support to one '08 contender. Find out who gets
her vote in Hot Topics below!

NO TIMELINE, BUT "BENCHMARKS WITH CONSEQUENCES": Speaker Nancy Pelosi will present a plan to House Democrats for a war
funding bill that won't include a timeline for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq but will feature benchmarks with
consequences, according to Democratic leadership aides. The bill also would raise the federal minimum wage to $7.25 per
hour from $5.15 per hour, and fund other domestic spending programs, which were still being negotiated. White House
spokeswoman Dana Perino said any talk of a deal was premature. "We're hopeful that the discussions over the emergency
supplemental funding bill for the troops is nearing a conclusion," she said. "We have not seen the final language yet,
and we look forward to reviewing it." The legislation would provide more than $90 billion to pay for the wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan through September 30, the end of the fiscal year. CNN: Dems plan Iraq bill minus timeline but with
benchmarks http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/05/22/war.funding/index.html

U.S. WANTS TO REMOVE "HARDENED SECTARIAN ACTORS" FROM TOP IRAQI ROLES: Top U.S. commanders and diplomats in Iraq are
completing a far-reaching campaign plan for a new U.S. strategy, laying out military and political goals and endorsing
the selective removal of hardened sectarian actors from Iraq's security forces and government. The classified plan,
scheduled to be finished by May 31, is a joint effort between Gen. David H. Petraeus, the senior American general in
Iraq, and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker. More than half a dozen people with knowledge of the plan discussed its
contents, although most asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about it to reporters. The
overarching aim of the plan, which sets goals for the end of this year and the end of 2008, is more political than
military: to negotiate settlements between warring factions in Iraq from the national level down to the local level.

SENATE SAVES "FRAGILE DEAL" ON IMMIGRATION FROM POSSIBLE COLLAPSE: A comprehensive immigration bill survived a
significant test on Tuesday as the Senate voted to keep a provision that would let hundreds of thousands of temporary
foreign workers enter the country each year. If the guest worker program, part of the "grand bargain" negotiated with
the Bush administration by a bipartisan group of 12 senators, had been stripped from the bill, the fragile deal could
have collapsed. Despite the vote on Tuesday, supporters of the bill were clearly on the defensive. Senator Mel
Martinez, Republican of Florida, who helped write the bill, said eliminating the guest worker program would be a "huge
problem" for the architects of the proposal. New York Times: Senate Votes to Keep Temporary Worker Program
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/23/washington/23immig.html

NO SEAT BELT ON THE RANCH? NO PROBLEM: President Bush found himself in a flap Tuesday about seat-belt use, a day after
a federal agency began a campaign to encourage drivers to buckle up. Video cameras caught Bush without his seat belt
while driving a pickup on his Texas ranch last weekend, giving a tour to NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer.
White House spokesman Tony Snow declined to comment in detail on Bush's driving habits but said, "We encourage
everybody to wear their seat belts." He noted Bush was driving slowly at his ranch when the incident was taped. On
Monday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) began its annual "Click it or Ticket" seat-belt
campaign, which runs through June 3. Bush did not violate Texas law. "On private property, you're not required to wear
your seat belt," said Tela Mange, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Public Safety. She said "it's fairly
common" in the ranchlands of Texas. USA Today: Ranch exempt from 'Click It or Ticket'

NEW HOUSE RULES HAVE "DONE LITTLE TO ALTER BUSINESS AS USUAL" ON HILL: House Democratic leaders pushing a promised
lobbying overhaul are facing resistance from balky lawmakers and fending off accusations that a prominent member is
flouting new ethics rules. The Democratic leaders were forced to scrap a promise to double the current one-year
lobbying ban after lawmakers leave office. Now, they are struggling to pass legislation requiring lobbyists to disclose
the campaign contributions they "bundle" - collect and deliver - to lawmakers. Failing to deliver on both measures
would endanger similar provisions already passed by the Senate. New York Times: Democrats Find Ethics Overhaul Elusive
in House http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/23/washington/23lobby.html

NO REPRIMAND FOR MURTHA: House Democrats rejected a Republican bid Tuesday to reprimand Rep. John Murtha, a senior
lawmaker accused of threatening legislative reprisals against a GOP member who had crossed him. Before and after the
largely party-line vote, which caused some Democrats discomfort, Republicans taunted Democratic leaders about their
campaign promises to run a more ethical and open Congress. The House voted 219-189 to kill the Republicans' motion to
reprimand Murtha, a Pennsylvania Democrat, Iraq war foe and close ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Two
Democrats - Earl Blumenauer of Oregon and Jim Cooper of Tennessee - voted against killing the motion. One Republican -
Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania - voted for the motion to table, or kill, the proposed reprimand. AP via Yahoo! News: House
defeats bid to reprimand Murtha http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070523/ap_on_go_co/congress_murtha

FRANKEN BRINGS HIGH NET WORTH TO MN SENATE RACE: Al Franken, a comedian and best-selling author before launching his
Senate campaign this year, is worth between $4.3 million and $9.9 million, according to a financial disclosure form he
filed with the Senate. Franken, a Democrat who hopes to challenge Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman next year, listed a
salary of just over $1 million last year from his corporation, Alan Franken Inc. That corporation is the business
entity that provides Franken's services - such as speaking engagements and his prior service on Air America Radio - and
then pays Franken a salary at the end of the year after commissions, taxes and other fees are paid, said his campaign
spokesman, Andy Barr. AP via Yahoo! News: Al Franken's worth nothing to laugh at

KY GOV. FLETCHER DEFEATS PRIMARY CHALLENGERS: Overcoming the fallout from a political hiring scandal, Gov. Ernie
Fletcher won a decisive victory in the Republican gubernatorial primary last night over former U.S. Rep. Anne Northup
and Paducah businessman Billy Harper. Fletcher won half the Republican vote, an accomplishment that many had thought
was virtually impossible given his problems of the past two years. The scandal still threatens his election to a second
term in November, when he would need to attract votes from Democrats and independents to beat the Democratic nominee,
former Lt. Gov. Steve Beshear. But Fletcher clearly wasn't worried about that last night as he took the stage at the
Marriott Griffin Gate Hotel in Lexington as the jubilant crowd chanted, "Four more years, four more years." Louisville

SAIS INVITES CANDIDATES FOR IRAQ-ONLY DEBATE: Sen. Joseph Biden's (D-Del.) call for a Democratic debate "focused solely
on ending the war in Iraq" was answered this week, but he might be the only person who attends. Johns Hopkins
University's School of Advanced International Studies' Center on Politics and Foreign Relations invited the Democratic
presidential field to participate in a 90-minute debate on June 6 where Iraq will be the only discussion topic. At
press time, only one candidate aside from Biden had answered questions from The Hill about whether they planned to
attend. Sen. Christopher Dodd's (D-Conn.) campaign said the senator would not be attending because of a scheduling
conflict, though the campaign declined to specify what that conflict is. The Hill: Sen. Biden gets wish granted with
Iraq-only debate http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/sen.-biden-gets-wish-granted-with-iraq-only-debate-2007-05-23.html


THE NEW McCAIN... FURIOUS FUNDRAISER: As the Senate debate over immigration raged yesterday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.)
had breakfast, brunch and lunch fundraisers in Houston before heading north to gather money at a supporter's home in
Dallas and, later, from young professionals at a gourmet Mexican restaurant. It's the new McCain: Working furiously to
rebound from a lackluster fundraising effort in the first three months of the year, he is forgoing many opportunities
for public campaigning and sharply cutting back his role as a high-profile legislator with a knack for brokering deals.

"QUICK WIT" AND "STILETTO-SHARP TONGUE" AN ASSET AND LIABILITY: To anyone who has been pining for the
tell-it-like-it-is John McCain who ran for president in 2000, the days of longing may be over. In the South Carolina
GOP presidential debate last Tuesday, in a closed-door gathering of senators Thursday and then on a conference call
Monday with Republican-leaning bloggers, the Arizona senator flashed what may be both his biggest asset and his biggest
liability: a quick wit and stiletto-sharp tongue. The question for his presidential campaign this time is whether such
attacks are helpful reminders for many people of why they originally liked the man or enhance his image as someone
inclined to lose his cool when threatened. Politico: McCain's barbs may not help his campaign
http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0507/4139.html

"LAND MINES" FOR EDWARDS' POPULIST CAMPAIGN THEME: Democrat John Edwards has eloquently established his credentials as
an advocate for the poor with a presidential campaign focused on the devastating effects of poverty in America. But the
former North Carolina senator's populist drive has hit a series of troubling land mines: a pair of $400 haircuts, a
$500,000 paycheck from a hedge fund, and now a $55,000 payday for a speech on poverty to students at UC Davis. The
problem now facing the Democratic presidential candidate is whether the pileup of headlines, including the latest
regarding hefty fees from university speeches reported Monday by The Chronicle, threatens to obliterate Edwards'
dominant campaign theme. The former senator, who has been portrayed as the champion of the poor and the son of a humble
mill worker, now faces the possibility that voters will have a different image: that of a millionaire trial lawyer who
talks one way and lives another. San Francisco Chronicle: Recent headlines threaten Edwards' main campaign theme

ROMNEY A "CARD-CARRYING" YANKEE: Mitt Romney may have Midwestern roots, but after four decades in Belmont, two advanced
Harvard degrees, four years as Massachusetts governor, and many Red Sox games, he's a card-carrying Northeasterner
whether he likes it or not. In a country that loves Southern politicians, it is tough to run for president as a New
Englander, especially in Southern states. Romney is not a garrulous, up-from-nothing Arkansan like Bill Clinton. He's
no evangelical Georgia peanut farmer like Jimmy Carter. Nor is he a boots-wearing Northeasterner-turned-Texan like
President Bush and his father. Even as Romney has surged into the lead in some polls in the key primary states of New
Hampshire and Iowa in recent days, he is still struggling to rise above single figures in South Carolina, Alabama, and
Florida, likely to be the South's early primary battlegrounds. Boston Globe: In South, Romney struggles to go beyond
Yankee background

THOMPSON RUNNING? "HE BASICALLY ALREADY IS": Numerous signs point to a [Fred] Thompson candidacy, and a summertime
announcement is widely expected, although people close to him caution that he has not made a final decision about
running. Never mind that he basically already is. Thompson is hiring staff, speaking to conservative groups, writing
online columns on topics of the day and staking out positions on issues like the Senate immigration overhaul. He also
is testing his pitch on the Internet. "It's important to the future of this country that (Republicans) have somebody
that can win in November," Thompson said in a recent online interview. "People are looking for somebody who can talk
straight to them. That's what I hope I bring to bear." His expected entrance into the already crowded GOP field could
dramatically shake up the wide-open race but it's unclear who among the strongest contenders, Rudy Giuliani, John
McCain and Mitt Romney, would be affected the most. AP via Yahoo! News: Many signs point to Thompson candidacy

RUDY'S BLUE-STATE STRATEGY: Rudy Giuliani was off Tuesday on a second straight day of campaigning across New York with
a message aimed at Republican rivals outside his home state: I can battle them for the blues. The "them" is the
Democrats, who have been making much of picking up a red state or two and winning back the White House — perhaps riding
there with Giuliani's home-state rival, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. Giuliani pledges to take the battle against the
Democrats to the blue states. "One of Giuliani's arguments is that he can beat Hillary Clinton, and as long as Hillary
remains strong with the Democrats, that is a good argument for Rudy," said Lee Miringoff, head of Marist College's
Institute for Public Opinion. "Part of his strategy with Republicans in red states is he might be able to challenge
Democrats in blue states." AP via Yahoo! News: Giuliani: I can battle in the blues

DC MADAM ON THE HILLARY BANDWAGON: First, we learned that adult movie star Jenna Jameson supports Sen. Hillary
Clinton's run for president of the United States. Now, we learn that another, um, Taboo Titleholder backs the New York
senator's White House ambitions: Deborah Jeane Palfrey, aka, the "D.C. Madam." Yeas & Nays tracked down Palfrey
following her appearance at Nathans of Georgetown's "Q&A Cafe" Tuesday (where she told Nathans owner Carol Joynt that
she's a "conservative Democrat") and inquired into the politics of this former escort service owner. Palfrey admitted
that she's pulling for Hillary in 2008. "I think she's great," she said. "She's bright and articulate." But she doesn't
have similar feelings for the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, however. "I hate him," Palfrey said. "He
only got there because of his father." Examiner: DC Madam for Hillary!
