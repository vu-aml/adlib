Kam,
We created the real portfolios of all these books as well. We are waiting on the hierarchy from Risk Controls. If that is delayed, then we will simply dump all the real portfolios under a root portfolio for purposes of testing potential exposure, credit reserve and VaR.

Regards,
Ramesh

Thanks for making those changes.  Let us know when we are ready to start setting up the hierarchy.

Thanks

Kam, John, we found a few book_id name issues while trying to batch-load the books.

We were able to figure out the issues ourselves, but for your reference here are the changes we made:


FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	P	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	D	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	I	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	M	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	Y	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	

Note all 5 books were labeled as 'FB-EXECUTIVE'.  We instead named them

FB-EXECUTIVE-PRC
FB-EXECUTIVE-BAS
FB-EXECUTIVE-IDX
FB-EXECUTIVE-GDM
FB-EXECUTIVE-GDY

Also, we found these two books that had the same book ID:

FB-WEST1-GDM	M	F	M	WEST1	US GAS WEST	ERMS	plove	

FB-WEST1-GDM	M	F	M	WEST10	US GAS WEST	ERMS	plove	

Note that the second book should be named 'FB-WEST10-GDM', based on the WEST10 Region Code.

We fixed that one as well.

Please update your spreadsheet, and let us know if we need to discuss in the morning.

The next step is the hierarchy, which we should receive from Stephanie or Debbie in the morning.  Thanks.

Andrew
