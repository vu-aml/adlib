I don't know what happened to my previous message, but here are the details.

TD Securities is sending a team of 9 people to the data room tomorrow morning.  They should arrive between 8 and 8:30 Wednesday morning and stay through Thursday evening (They are planning on a late night on Wed).  

We are currently planning on using room 3371 for the data room, but are looking for another room that might be more accomodating for such a large group.  I will send you a list of TD's team members as soon as I get it.  Please let me know who your point person will be and the schedule for the initial meetings.

Thanks,
Mari
