Hey,

So what's going?  What is the deal with the new company?  Are you guys
pretty much staying in the same place just now have a new name and some
liquidity.  I think I'm going to have to pass on the Vegas trip this year.
I really need to save money for the house and even though I'm passing on an
opportunity to make money, although that hasn't been the case my last 4
trips, I'm still going to have to pass.  Plus I might be going for another
bachelor party around the late Feb early March time frame anyway.

Yes Kyle Lilly is now working here.  His brother-in-law works here and I
think since they had there first child he was looking to get around more
family, neither his nor his wife's families live in Houston.  So anyway I
think we had been talking to him since the summer and it ended up being
pretty good timing since we didn't hire him until December.  The job is
alright.  The hours are starting to come back down and for the most part
everything is going good.  It seems like time of service has a lot to do
with moving up in this company and that is a little discouraging, but I
guess I will not worry about that too much.

Have you heard from Victor?  Has he found a job yet?

Well I hope you guys have fun and let me know how much money you win.

Kyle

Hey,

Phillip already made reservations and Jeff is waiting to make sure he can
go.  Darren and his wife have made their plans, and Dawn and Gary have
also, I think.  I will next week, and a couple other girls from risk are
going too.  We're leaving on the 13th, returning the 16th.  Staying at the
Mirage.

You could win thousands in Vegas to use for your house.  What other
vacation can do that.

Well, we think we should hear something today as far as who we work for
now.  I'm sure it will be next week though.  We're assuming it will happen
and have been setting up all new files and databases.  It should be
interesting.

How is your job?  Does Kyle Lilly work for you now?

Later,
Kam

Maybe so, I'm guessing that is during Spring Break again?  Not too sure if
I really liked it with that many people out there, too many high dollar
tables.  Have you guys already made reservations?  Give me a little more
info but I kind have been saving for the house.  It should be ready around
late March or early April and I know I will have to buy a lot of stuff for
that, like a kegorator you know important things.

So what's the latest at Big E or I guess Little E now.  You think you guys
will go to the new joint venture or what ever happens to the trading
company when they sell it off?  Have you been looking?

Keep me in the loop.

Kyle

Subject: Valero at Enron Job Fair on Friday


Hey guys just thought I would let you know that Valero is going to be at
the Job Fair this Friday at Enron Field from 1-4 and I will be one of the
people attending it to represent us.  So if you are going to be there make
sure you come by and at least say hello.  Plus depending on when my flight
back is going to be and how soon I can leave the Fair we plan on going
somewhere and getting a couple of drinks.  So come by drop off a resume and
maybe we can get some drinks.

Note:  If you are interested in Valero there is a very good possibility
that the Director of Mid-Office will be attending as well and it would be a
good chance for an informal interview.

Hope everybody is doing alright and pass the word on to anybody I may have
missed.

Kyle
