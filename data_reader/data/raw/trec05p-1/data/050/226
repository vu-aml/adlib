X-Stn-Info:


 I am hopeing that this note finds everyone healthy.  We have spent a rough few days together, yet for myself today beacame much more difficult.  I, unforunately, had to watch a segment on NBC with Sheila Brown, Class of '96, holding a picture of a loved one.  I've been fortunate enough to have my friends return safely home, yet Sheila is still searching for her loved one.  Please inform me if you Tara Drake's e-mail address.  Last I know she worked for MTV.
Sheila was my girlfriend for awile, and you who know me,know I don't say that very often.  She is a special women who needs to hear from her friends now.  I would appreciate everyones help.  I am thinking of all of you!!!  My thoughts and prayers are with you, your families, and your co-workers.

Joe
