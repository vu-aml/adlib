Attached below is the final report on NBP's 2001 objectives. I think it was a very successful and active year. I believe we have NBP on track to continue its growth in assets and earnings despite all the recent distractions. Of couse, there was concern with the level of Crestone/Bearpaw earnings, but I feel that group did a good job of dealing with a lot of changes and challenges given the acquisition and the energy markets. Much of the downside on Crestone was made up by beating plan significantly on NBPL.

If you would like more details or if you would like to see status reports for any of my divisions, let me know.
