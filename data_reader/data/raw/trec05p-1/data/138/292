website is Benelliusa.com
	
Recent pricing on two models is:

Benelli Sport (removable vent ribs) for serious competitive shooters is
$1145.  This model is very similar to the Montefeltro.

Montefeltro (I shoot this one) with wood stock, 12 gauge, 26" or 28" bbl
is $845.  You can also get the M1 (same as Montefeltro but with black
syn stock) for same price.  Both shoot 2.75 and 3 inch shells.  Both
come with 5 choke tubes.

Let me know if you have further questions.
