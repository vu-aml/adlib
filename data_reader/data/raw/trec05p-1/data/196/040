Our baby, Addison Sterling, was born on Saturday, January 12th at 12:31 PM.  She was fairly big - 8 lbs 14 ozs and she is 20 inches long.  I've attached a link to the hospital's website that has her picture (she is much cuter in person, of course :)

We named her after Addison St which runs by Wrigley Field (Home of the Chicago Cubs) and the Pound Sterling.

Cami is doing well and we have returned home on Sunday night.
