Tracy,  We will be increasing NNG Operations Capital Current Estimate by $4.0MM with the forecast coming up to cover the additional Cooper Pre-Buy Standby.  Morris indicated that there was a pot of Capital dollars somewhere in ETS that can be reduced so that we don't increase the total ETS Capital Budget.  Can you confirm this?

Thanks,  Elaine

I spoke with Morris, and we will increase NNG Operations for the $4.0MM and request that it be offset elsewhere within ETS.  I believe that Rod may have a pot at the ETS level.  We will need to work with Tracy on this.

If you have dollars that you will not spend, though, please let us know. 

Thanks,  Elaine

We're talking about $4.0m for 2001. Should I go ahead & increase our Curr Est to be sent out this week?  Diane

As far as I know, we are to adjust our C/E up for the amount of the pre-by bookings.

$1,957,583 has hit the Blanket Standby WBS for the Cooper pre-buy inventory.  According to John Reese, another $2,010,921 will hit this year.  How are these dollars to be funded?  I am assuming that we will be adjusting our CE for the Cooper Pre-Buy dollars, but I would like confirmation on how you would like for us to handle.

If you could let us know ASAP it would be appreciated.

Thanks!
