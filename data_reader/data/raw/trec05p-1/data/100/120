Rick/George,

Below is this weeks iPayit update report 

Overall, the Accounts Payable process continues to improve and appears to be heading toward a steady state. Though on a daily basis we continue to take calls regarding errors which have occurred and/or confusion as to why things happen like they do in this new process, overall these calls and issues are occurring at a much reduced  pace. We are continuing to see improvements in the overall aging of invoices sitting in in the various stages of the accounts payable process including document handling, transaction processing, support group and employee iPayit inboxes. Additionally, the call center is consistently answering calls well within the established service level agreements.  

Primary areas of focus:
1) Monitor and manage the various stages of the process and ensure that invoices are flowing through each stage within an acceptable time frame.
2) Continue to network and assist the business units in addressing questions/issues/problems 
3) Assess effectiveness of non-routine AP transaction processing tasks which SourceNet is attempting to perform and make necessary mid-course changes (i.e. P-Card expense allocation journal entries, etc.
4) Complete system integration audit verifying proper transfer of information from the various components of the iPayit platform (FileNet, SAP and iPayit).
5) Implement processes and procedures for all return check/void check/refunds handling. Assign roles and responsibilities for GSS/Accounting/Treasury/SourceNet
6) Improvements in the turn-around time with call center ticket which are escalated
7) Evaluate the benefits of migrating the AP pricing model to transaction based verses the current cost/plus model

Attached for your information is the "Drain the Swamp" scorecard for the period ending October 23rd.

Please advise if you have any questions or if you need any additional information.

Thank You
John
