After some preliminary analysis, it does not look like our big counterparties i.e. Dynegy, Rliant, Duke, El Paso etc., are closing down their positions. On the contrary their net positions seem to be rising. This is only for NYMEX related financial instruments, I haven't looked at phys or power yet.

Just thought you would like to know.
