BERKELEY AND COLUMBIA ANNOUNCE JOINT EXECUTIVE MBA PROGRAM
The Haas School and Columbia Business School are jointly launching their 
new Berkeley-Columbia Executive MBA program this fall. The new program is 
being marketed by both schools across the nation starting this week.

The Berkeley Columbia EMBA blends the distinctive strengths of the two 
schools: Wall Street and Silicon Valley, New York and California. Aimed at 
a select group of high-level executives, the new program will enroll its 
first class in June 2002.

The marketing launch of the EMBA program, which was originally scheduled 
for the week of September 11 was delayed due to the terrorist attacks in 
New York and Washington, is commencing now and will continue into spring 
2002. The EBMA program places a major emphasis on drawing applicants from 
the west coast. Information sessions for prospective applicants across the 
nation start on November 7 and will continue through February.

Information sessions will be held throughout California and western states 
as well as New York, east coast states, and the Midwest.
Upcoming information sessions in California include:
    Berkeley, Nov. 7, 6:00 to 7:30 pm
    Los Angeles, Nov. 28, 5:00 to 6:30 pm
    Oakland, Nov. 29, 5:00 to 6:30 pm
    San Francisco, Nov. 30, 8:00 to 9:00 am
    San Jose, Dec. 4, 5:00 to 6:30 pm
    Sacramento, Dec. 11, 8:00 to 9:00 am
    Orange County, Dec. 13, 8:00 to 9:30 am
    San Diego, Dec. 14, 8:00 to 9:30 am

For more detailed information on these and other events, please go to the 
web site at:
http://web.haas.berkeley.edu/embaadmissions/events/index.cfm.

The EMBA curriculum will offer participants fresh insights into the complex 
forces of global, financial, technological and entrepreneurial changes that 
are transforming the business world. It leverages the schools' locations in 
two of the world's most important business centers - New York City and the 
San Francisco/Silicon Valley area.

"In today's turbulent business environment, executives must possess 
outstanding management skills and a keen understanding of the rapidly 
changing nature of the economy and business world," said Haas School Dean 
Laura Tyson. "This unique educational partnership will develop leaders with 
the requisite vision and skills for success."

Designed to accommodate the busy executive, the Berkeley-Columbia EMBA 
features a convenient schedule of 15 weeks of instruction over 19 months 
alternating between New York and Berkeley. The bi-coastal curriculum, 
taught by the faculty of these two premier institutions, will offer broad, 
general management courses with a strategic perspective, including a series 
of cutting-edge electives in areas such as IT strategy and international 
finance.

Companies sponsoring promising executives in the Berkeley-Columbia EMBA 
will see immediate benefits from the program, as participants are 
encouraged to apply cutting-edge concepts to their workplace.

In addition to receiving MBA degrees from both Columbia Business School and 
UC Berkeley, participants will benefit from a lifetime membership in the 
global professional networks of both schools that includes over 50,000 alumni.

UNDERGRADUATES COMPETE IN INVESTMENT BANKING CASE FINALS ON TUESDAY, OCTOBER 30
Haas undergraduates have a chance to tackle real-world problems with 
creative solutions every year in the Investment Banking Case 
Competition.  The Haas School's undergraduate program office and Goldman, 
Sachs & Co. are hosting the final event for the fourth annual case 
competition on Tuesday, October 30, from 6:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. in the 
Arthur Andersen Auditorium. The finals are free and open to the entire UC 
Berkeley community.

Each year this competition showcases one of Goldman Sachs' recent 
high-profile transactions to give interested students an opportunity to 
demonstrate and further develop their knowledge and skill base. This year's 
case focuses on the recent sale of Cobalt Networks to Sun Microsystems.

Over 30 teams submitted cases to the competition. The final four were 
chosen on Friday, October 23. Each of the finalist teams will make a short 
presentation followed by questions from a panel of judges, which will 
include company management, investment bankers, members of the investment 
community, and Haas faculty.  The winner will be announced, followed by the 
judges' critique of the presentations, and a discussion of what actually 
happened during the sale of Cobalt Networks.  There will be time allotted 
for questions from the audience. A reception will follow the event in the 
Helzel Boardroom.

LEARN THE SECRETS OF POST-BUBBLE MARKETING WITH LOUIS STERN THURSDAY, 
NOVEMBER 1
Kellogg School of Management Professor Louis Stern will share his vision of 
"21st Century Marketing" at the second annual David Aaker Distinguished 
Lecture Series in Marketing on Thursday, Nov. 1, at 5 p.m. in the Wells 
Fargo Room. Seating will be on a first-come, first-served basis.

Last year a standing-room-only crowd heard Prof. Emeritus David Aaker, one 
of the world's leading authorities on branding, lecture on "Brand 
Leadership" as the inaugural lecture in this series.

Stern is the John D. Gray Distinguished Professor of Marketing.

"Perspectives about how to use the Internet and the web must be re-assessed 
in light of the hard lessons learned over the past several years during the 
irrational exuberance era," says Stern. He focuses on issues related to 
designing and managing marketing channels in his research. In the lecture, 
he will address changes to marketing strategies and tactics that are 
required in order to find the right paths to profitability in the 
post-Internet-bubble era.

TOP HAAS ECONOMISTS OFFER THEIR FORECAST FOR THE US ECONOMY NOVEMBER 9
One of the many benefits of attending the Haas School and UC Berkeley is 
the chance to hear some of the nation's foremost economists comment on the 
current economy. On Friday, November 9, 2001, at 4:00 p.m., Dean Laura 
Tyson invites Haas students to a forum on the US economy.

"Economic Outlook Forum 2001" will examine economic conditions in the 
United States in the wake of the events of September 11 and the ongoing war 
on terrorism. Speaking at the event will be Profs. Severin Borenstein, 
Jerry Engel, Rich Lyons, Ken Rosen, Hal Varian, and Janet Yellen.  Dean 
Tyson and Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Ben Hermalin will moderate. 
Yellen, Lyons, and Rosen will give an overview of domestic and global 
macroeconomic conditions. Borenstein will speak on energy and airlines, 
Engel will speak on venture capital, and Varian will speak on technology.

Tickets are available in the degree program offices.  They will be 
distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. Standing-room-only tickets 
will be available the day of the event.

INTEL CEO TO SPEAK AT RESEARCH DIALOGUE ON NOVEMBER 14
The Business Faculty Research Dialogues bring major corporate speakers to 
Haas every year to create a continuing discussion around a central theme. 
This year the theme is "Adding Value with Information Technology" and the 
lineup of speakers is impressive.

First up is Craig R. Barrett, president and chief executive officer of 
Intel Corporation, on Wednesday, November 14, at 4:00 p.m. in the Arthur 
Andersen Auditorium. Barrett has been in the news recently commenting on 
the possibility of the Windows XP release increasing demand for new 
computers. He has been fairly negative on this possibility, instead stating 
that Intel continues to focus on its core business.

Before joining Intel in 1974, Barrett was an associate professor of 
materials science at Stanford, where he earned his bachelors, masters, and 
Ph.D. degrees in materials science. He joined Intel Corporation in 1974 as 
a technology development manager. He was elected to Intel board of 
directors in 1992 and was named the company's chief operating officer in 
1993. He became Intel's fourth president in May 1997 and chief executive 
officer in 1998.

Barrett will be followed by Eric Benhamou, chairman of the board for 3COM 
Corporation and Palm, Inc., on March 15, 2002, and Eric Schmidt, chairman 
of the board and CEO of Google, Inc. in Spring 2002 (date TBD).
