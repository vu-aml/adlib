All documentation has been executed and delivered to Bridgeline. Funding will occur tomorrow as we did not get final doc.'s delivered to Buyer until 5:00 p.m.  I also have the DOW letter agreement fully executed.  All we have left is PB-KBB and M&H tomorrow and a little clean up work by Kathleen and myself.

Thanks for all the hard work.
