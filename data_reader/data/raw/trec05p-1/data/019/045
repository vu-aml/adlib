Dear Sir,

With due respect and humility, this mail is intended for you the  recipient  only. Please contact the undersigned, if you are not the intended  recipient or  you received it in error. I should have contacted you through surface  mail or  courier service, but considering the urgency needed to conclude this  transaction, we decided to contact you by e-mail.

My colleagues and I, are members of the board of Management of City  Trust  Bank. We discovered during our interim auditing of the central accounts  of our  bank that some expatriates invested in treasury bills totaling  US$15,600,000.00 (Fifteen Million, Six Hundred Thousand United States  Dollars)  since 1998. The treasury bills are now matured and due for collection,  but the  depositors can no longer be traced as most of them have departed from  the  contact address. Majority of the depositors were involved in the air  crash of  31stOctober 1999 involving an Egyptians airline plane 990 with other  passengers onboard as you can confirm from the website below:   www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his  next of  kin to come forward and claim his money because we cannot release it  unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines and policies but unfortunately we  learnt  that all his supposed next of kin or relation can not be traced leaving  nobody  behind for the claims. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other my colleague now decided to make  this  business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or  relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since  nobody is coming forth and we do not want the fund to get into the corrupt 
Government officials in the nation, as the fund will be retired into the Bank treasury as an unclaimed Bill.

According to our Banking policies and guideline here this stipulates  that if  such money remained unclaimed after five years, the money will  automatically  be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.  The request  of  foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact  that the  customer was a foreigner and we cannot stand as next of kin to a  foreigner.

We agree that 35 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in  respect to the provision of a foreign account, 5 % will be for  reimbursement  of any expenses incurred during the curse of the transaction and 60 %  would be  for me and my colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit  your  country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as  arranged, I  will direct you on how to  apply first to the bank as relation or next  of kin  of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number,  your  private telephone and fax number for easier and effective communication  and  location where the money will be remitted upon receipt If you are  interested,  please reply immediately via the private email address below, upon your  response, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the  application.

I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch  free  and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required  arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me  immediately as soon as you receive this letter.


I wait to hear from your response.

Yours faithfully,

Francis Oyen.
