If you have not yet volunteered, we still need people and would really appreciate your help.  Below is some information about the project we will be working on.  I will send more details to the definite volunteers.  

If we can't have your time, we would still like to borrow your tools.  Also, we are collecting food and baked goods to take to this man, who's only food is from Meals on Wheels (healthy stuff).

I look forward to your responses letting me know how you'll be able to help.  If you have questions, please call me at 3-0322.

Below is information about the house you will be volunteering at on Wednesday, August 8th.  Please send me a list of all the AA volunteers, as well as the ones who will be staying all day.

This house is in need of outside repairs.  Mr. Elvin Rayes is an older man and lives there alone.  He is a veteran and is very proud and doesn't want to accept charity.  However, he is going to let us help him with the outside.  He was very nice when I met him on Sunday and I told him that all the people coming over to help were excited they didn't have to go to work for the day.  This made it seem like we were doing more of a favor for ourselves versus for him.  He liked that.  This house really needs a lot of TLC

I would suggest everyone wear old clothes they don't mind painting in and their GREEN United Way t-shirts (shorts are fine but jeans may be better for those who want to mow - this is Houston and it's summer).  Below is a safety note one site leader sent out to his team.  You may want to forward this to your AA volunteers.

Safety First!!!

Let's make sure we are all safe. We all want to go home just like we get there - no injuries!!
A few safety rules:

If you see someone working unsafe - either tell them, or tell me immediately (so I can tell them)!
Plan your work, and discuss it with your work crew.
Don't hurry, use common sense.
Use the right tool for the job
Be careful lifting, lift with your legs, not your back.  If item is heavy or bulky, get help! - Don't be macho.
Be sure to wear safety glass or goggles when appropriate (weed eating, power saws, grass mowing, etc).
Wear work gloves
Make sure ladders are secure, and either tied down or someone stabilizing the base.
Be aware of people around you and what they are doing.

Tasks

Here are the main tasks at the Ettrick house.  Once everyone gets out there, we can shift the work according to everyone's preference as long as the work gets done.  People may work on more than one task depending on progress, congestion, and what people would like to do.

Replace rotten outside trim boards
Replace garage door (rotten on bottom)
Trim trees with chainsaw - especially in the back yard
Replace soffit screening
Clean bathroom - 2 people
Yard work - trim hedges, mow and edge
Replace screen door
Caulk around the windows
Scrape old paint and paint outside
Replace window screens
Replace doorbell

Tools

Here is the list of tools.  Bring what you have and make sure to put your name on it with a permanent marker.  Please let me know if you are missing any tools and I will do my best to get them there.  It may be good for people that have tool boxes just to bring them if they can.  It always seems like there will be something they will need that isn't there.
