Area School District Exclusively Specifies The Aurora Permanent Construction

<P>
<DIV class=ar>CHOWCHILLA, Calif., June 9 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Global 
Diversified Industries, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: <A 
href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=gdvi.ob&amp;d=t">GDVI</A> - <A 
href="http://www.zinester.com/lr/186682/4952643">News</A>), focused on the modular 
building industry with emphasis on the education market, is pleased to report 
that it has secured a contract with a prominent Los Angeles area public school 
district valued at more than $3 million. 
<P>The project consists of nearly 26,000 square feet of total space distributed 
over several campuses for multiple uses including classrooms, music rooms, 
childcare, health services and others. The school district, including parents of 
the students, wanted "permanent type" structures to aesthetically blend with 
their existing campuses. When they learned through industry sources that Global 
Modular, Inc. acquired the rights to Aurora Modular designs, they contacted 
Global and expressed their urgent need for the project to be completed by early 
fall of 2005. 
<P>Global Diversified Industries Chairman and CEO Phil Hamilton said, "Due to 
our recent plant modifications including the implementation of a fourth 
production line, we are positioned to accommodate this magnitude of an order 
with a quick turn around." Hamilton added that, "since our state approved 
designs are current, we can commence fabrication within the next couple weeks. 
During the production process, our construction division will be on site 
performing earth and concrete work resulting in optimum continuity throughout 
the entire project."
