TO WINNERS IN OUR PROGRAM
 
We wish to congratulate you over your success in our computer balloting sweepstake held on 25th April 2005. 
 
This is a millennium scientific computer game in which email addresses were used. It is a promotional program aimed at encouraging internet users; therefore you do not need to buy ticket to enter for it. However, your email address was attached to ticket number 10CBG3471913; with serial number 19034 draw the lucky numbers 1-9-74-31, which eventually won the lottery in the first category of the draws. This entitled to a cash award of 
US$ 2, 500,000.00 (TWO MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S DOLLARS). This is from total prize money of US$30,000,000.00 distributed to winners from 1st to 3rd categories. 
 
Note that this program was largely promoted and sponsored by a group of philanthropist, industrialists from the internet ware industry and some other big multinational firms who wish to be anonymous. 
 
To begin your claim, please contact the claims coordinator
