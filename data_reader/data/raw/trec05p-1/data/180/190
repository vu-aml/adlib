AOPA ePilot Subscribers,
Please disregard the message at the top of this morning's issue 
f "AOPA ePilot" that suggested that your AOPA membership was 
bout to expire or that it was your last issue of the newsletter. 
oliday computer gremlins conspired to erroneously send the 
essage to most "ePilot" subscribers this morning.
Again, please disregard the message. We apologize for the error 
nd will work to assure that it does not happen again. Thank you 
or your patience and please have a happy new year.
Sincerely,
AOPA ePilot Staf
