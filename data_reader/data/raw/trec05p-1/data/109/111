To Our Readers:

Here's the latest on Operation Enduring Freedom and the anthrax cases at
home:

U.S. warplanes attacked Taliban targets along Afghanistan's border with
Tajikistan for the first time in an attempt to take out artillery used to
disrupt a Northern Alliance supply route.
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/STRIKE_MAIN.html

For the first time since 1935, the U.S. Supreme Court won't be hearing
cases in its historic chambers, after anthrax was discovered at a facility
that sorts the high court's mail.

Plus,

The FBI has found no traces of anthrax in cars owned by two Sept. 11
hijackers, ABCNEWS has learned.
