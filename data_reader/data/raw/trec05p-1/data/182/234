As for the past three years, the DASH Library is probably a reliable source of information and should capture most of the transactions.  Prior to that, I can't say.  When do you need this info?

Hi Chip,
 
In connection with the DIP financing, we are required to schedule assets (broadly defined) acquired in the past 5 years which exceed $100 million in cost. I was wondering if it might be possible to research this by reviewing DASH's, since I would assume that all such transactions would have been DASH'ed.  I would appreciate your thoughts on this approach.
 
I'm out but will be checking email.  
 
Here's hoping for a good New Year!
 
Kay
