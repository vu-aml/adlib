TOP STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

APPLE LOWERS GUIDANCE
Apple Computer (NYSE: AAPL), a maker of flashy personal 
computers, beat Wall Street's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings 
estimate yesterday, but profits fell 61% over the year-ago 
period as the company's business struggled because of slowing 
consumer spending. The company also lowered its guidance for the 
coming quarter, when personal computer sales usually pick up 
because of increased spending during the holiday season.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Siebel Systems (Nasdaq: SEBL), which makes customer-based 
software, disappointed investors with a rare earnings miss 
yesterday, forcing the stock down as much as 25% in after hours. 
The company reported third-quarter earnings of $35.2 million, or 
$0.07 per share, on revenue of $428.5 million. Wall Street 
expected earnings of $0.09 cents a share and sales of $490.8 
million. In the year-ago quarter, Siebel earned $67.5 million, 
on sales of $496.5 million. 

Texas Instruments (NYSE: TXN), the world's largest maker of 
computer chips for mobile phones, reported better-than-expected 
sales and earnings after the markets closed yesterday. The 
company lost $57 million, or $0.03 per share, compared to a 
profit of $589 million, or $0.33 per share, in the year-ago 
period. Wall Street expected a loss of $0.04 per share. Revenues 
dropped 9% over the year-ago period to $1.9 billion, slightly 
better than expected. 

Broadcom (Nasdaq: BRCM), a maker of communications chips, 
reported a loss of $1.6 billion, or $6.36 per share, versus a 
loss of $14.1 million, or $0.06 per share, in the year-ago 
quarter. Revenues fell from $319.2 million in the same period 
last year to $213.6 million. Excluding charges, Broadcom lost 
$0.13 per share, two cents ahead of Wall Street's estimate. (For 
more on Broadcom's business, visit our InDepth: Computer 
Hardware page.)

Sprint (NYSE: FON), the third largest long-distance carrier in 
the U.S., posted third-quarter profits that fell 36% and said it 
was canceling its high-speed network access "ION" initiative, a 
move that will force it to cut 6000 workers and take a $2 
billion charge. Sprint earned $0.28 per share, versus $0.43 per 
share in the year-ago period, inline with Wall Street's 
estimate. Sprint PCS (NYSE: PCS) lost $0.29 per share, versus 
Wall Street's estimate of $0.22 per share.

POST OF THE DAY

THE CHANGING IMAGE OF LUCENT
"I have never been more proud to be a Lucent employee than I 
have over the past six weeks. The spirit that has pervaded all 
Lu employees during this time has been inspiring. Whether the 
employee is an Installer, Engineer, Customer Service Rep, or 
Program Manager, I have never heard anyone complain about the 
long hours we are working."
