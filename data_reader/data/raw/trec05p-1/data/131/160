HOUSE, SENATE CONFEREES AGREE ON AIRPORT SECURITY COMPROMISE

House and Senate conferees agree on a compromise airport
security bill that would require baggage screeners to be
federal employees for two years. After two years, the
agreement would allow individual airports to "opt out" of
the federal system if they meet certain standards.  The bill
also allows a one-year transition period after enactment for
airports to move to the federalized system. During the
transition period, the federal government would oversee the
contracting companies that employ current baggage screeners.

Leaders in the Senate and the House have signed off on the
deal, and both chambers are scheduled to vote on the
conference report Nov. 16.  Lawmakers from both parties
expect the bill to pass.

Senate Majority Leader Daschle (D-S.D.) calls the agreement
"a big victory" and says he expects "broad bipartisan
support" for the measure. House Speaker Hastert (R-Ill.)
hails the agreement, noting that in addition to baggage
screeners, it places airline mechanics and food servers
under federal supervision, and it requires federal
supervisors to be present at all boarding gates. . . . Page

SEVENTH CIRCUIT SAYS CHEMICAL FIRMS MUST ARBITRATE POST-SALE
DISPUTE

A chemical company that sold part of a facility to another
chemical company must arbitrate a union's claim that a
bargaining contract requires the two companies to continue
using a unified seniority list and allow transfers between
the two units, the Seventh Circuit rules ("CK Witco Corp. v.
Paper, Allied-Industrial, and Chemical Employees Local
60-807, "7th Cir., No. 00-3413, 11/9/01). CK Witco Corp. and
the Paper, Allied-Industrial, and Chemical Employees
negotiated a contract covering a facility in Mapleton, Ill.
The contract stated it would be binding upon any purchaser.
Witco sold one of two plants at the facility to Goldschmidt
Chemical Corp. during the term of the contract. The union
objected when the two companies prepared separate seniority
lists and prohibited employee transfers between the two
plants.

Reversing summary judgment for Witco and Goldschmidt, the
appeals court decides the bargaining contract's arbitration
provision covers the dispute. "[T]he employees in each
[plant] possess a contractual entitlement against their
respective current employer to maintenance of the 'full
force and effect' of the [bargaining contract] in the event
of a sale," Judge Williams writes. "The scope of that
entitlement and the attendant duty on the employers is a
matter for the arbitrator to resolve," she says. . . . Page

HOUSE APPROVES RETIREMENT ADVICE MEASURE

The House votes 280-144 to approve legislation that would
allow financial institutions that administer qualified
employer-sponsored defined contribution retirement plans to
provide investment advice to plan participants without
employers being liable for specific advice. The Retirement
Security Advice Act (H.R. 2269) would create a new exemption
from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act's
prohibited transaction rules. It would also require
qualified investment advisers--registered financial
institutions and their employees--to disclose to
participants relevant fees and material affiliations with
investment products.

The House rejects by a 243-180 vote a substitute that sought
to address lingering concerns among some Democrats. The
substitute called for model forms for making disclosures,
registration of all financial institution employees that
provide advice, enhanced legal remedies for breach of
fiduciary duty, and the provision of an alternate
independent adviser if the designated adviser has a
potential conflict of interest. . . . Page A-13

MICHIGAN ECONOMISTS EXPECT SHORT RECESSION

The U.S. economy is in a recession that should be short and
shallow, economists at the University of Michigan Economic
Outlook Conference predict. They say they expect lower
interest rates and higher federal spending to pull the
economy out of decline.

Recovery should be under way by next spring, says Saul H.
Hymans, UM professor of economics. "I peg the length of the
recession at two, maybe three quarters," he says. No one
industry will lead the way out of the recession, as growth
resumes during the second quarter of 2002, Hymans says. . .

SURVEY FINDS 63 PERCENT OF EMPLOYERS GRANTING THREE YEAR-END
HOLIDAYS

The calendar bodes well for workers this holiday season, as
Christmas and New Year's Day fall on Tuesdays, giving
employees an excellent shot at some "extra" time off,
according to BNA's latest annual survey of year-end holiday
plans.

More than three out of five surveyed employers (63 percent)
will grant at least three paid days off for the holiday
season, up from 49 percent in 2000-2001, when Christmas and
New Year's Day fell on Mondays. Workers stand a good chance
of enjoying an extended holiday weekend, as a majority of
responding organizations have a full paid day off slated for
Christmas Eve (Monday, Dec. 24). Employers' holiday
scheduling continues to be slightly more conservative than a
decade ago, when, for example, in 1990-1991, a year when the
national holidays also fell on Tuesday, seven out of 10
companies gave workers at least three days off. . . . Page
