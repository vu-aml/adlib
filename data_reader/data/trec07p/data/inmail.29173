In this case, sorting the vtable functions put the init vtable method pointer 
in the middle of the _vtable struct, not at the start.  The i386 and sun4 JIT 
operations looked for init as the first vtable method to use it as an offset 
into the struct.  You can guess what happens when you not only get the wrong 
offset for the vtable method pointer you want but also dereference way past 
the end of the struct where you probably don't have a function pointer at 
all... KAPOW!

Here's the fix (r18423), for fun:

--- src/jit/sun4/jit_emit.h     (revision 3381)
+++ src/jit/sun4/jit_emit.h     (local)
@@ -849,7 +849,7 @@
     int    idx, pi, i;
     size_t offset;
 
-    offset  = offsetof(VTABLE, init);
+    offset  = offsetof(VTABLE, absolute);
     offset += nvtable * sizeof (void *);
 
     for (idx = 1; idx <= n; idx++) {

I added some cleanup to the x86 file while I was tracing through it.
