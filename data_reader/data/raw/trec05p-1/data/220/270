You will have access soon - Stephanie will send you your ID's and passwords.

We have a lot of work to do in there - so we don't want everyone in there quite yet.  The problem is - if traders are playing with the products while we are trying to re-build the products and data elements with UBS names - we are going to have issues.

The other thing I want to make sure everyone understands - this is our new production data base - not a test data base.  
There are a limited number of authorized users assigned to "testing" or playing around with the data - and they are responsible for cleaning it up too.   
We will allow people to play for the simulation only.

Once we finish building our UBS production data base - we will the copy it to our test data base - and resume our bridge testing from there to the other test environments (our test environment still has the old Enron data).

Tom,

Everyone in risk management needs to get access to EOL bridge monitor and reports.  What do we need to do to get this and how soon can it be granted?  We need this by Thursday to be prepared for testing.

Thanks

Kam
