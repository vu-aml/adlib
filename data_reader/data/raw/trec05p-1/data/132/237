I am forwarding this to you because Tana's return e-mail message stated that she would not be back to work until 29 Nov.

Any help you can give me will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

Your entities are classified as being potentially subject to FERC reporting requirements.  Jim Derrick and Greg Whalley were to come off the slates 1 Nov.  I need to paper the Glisan/Bowen swap,  as well as the replacements for Messrs. Derrick and Whalley.

Please let me know who will replace Messrs. Derrick and Whalley, so I can paper all of the above for the entities listed below.

Clickpaper.com, L.L.C.
CommodityLogic LLC
DealBench L.L.C.
Enron Net Works LLC
EnronOnline, LLC
	Directors:  JDerrick, MHaedicke, GWhalley
