Folks,

Some of you were looking for a list of who's coming.  Shown below is a
headcount that should be fairly up to date and includes people who signed up
for either the Class Dinner, Class BBQ or Golf Tourney or some combination
thereof.  If you know some folks who are missing from this list it would be
a good idea to get ahold of them asap as we haven't received payment for any
events!

For last minute signups please call the Alumni Office (310) 333-ALUM.  You
can also pay at the door for most of these events, but it is highly
advisable to let us know you plan to come!

Sincerely,
Steve Smith
On behalf of Pete, Lynne, Melissa and many Reunion Organizers

ps This list does not include the Beer Bust or FEMBA Dinner, I'm trying to
get those lists as well...
