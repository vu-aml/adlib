Kim-
Here is the August spreadsheet.  These are the changes I've made so far:

I changed the formula in column R
I added in the new contracts for August

The differences between my model and the invoice are the way that they calculate the actual gas flow to Malin (column L on mine and column Z on theirs);

It also appears that they do not include the Redwood credit.

Looking at my model now, I also don't remember what the calculation in column D is for.  It seems kind of unnecessary to me and doesn't make much sense.

I know this is a lot of stuff to look at.  If you don't understand what I just wrote, ask me and I'll explain what I'm trying to say.
Thanks,
Mara
