Please see the attached draft letter response to Sen. Murkowski's recent correspondence to Ken.  

The use of "premature at this time" signals that we have really not studied the legislative proposals, which is true. 

Murkowski is keen to preserve ANGTA and keep new enabling legislation off the agenda.

If you are satisfied with this response, I will prepare an original for signature.
