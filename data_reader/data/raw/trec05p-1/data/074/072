These are the documents that Bear will require for the new account.  They have agreed to accept the same terms we negotiated for the ECI account.  Mary Kay at Bear should be able to help coordinate the effort from Bear's side.

If we can locate the ECI execution doc can we simply duplicate and change for the new entity's info?

Thanks,

Tom
