work in IT lists companies that excel in five areas of employment: career
development, retention, benefits, diversity, and training. According to
the [2]scorecard, the top five retention methods are: competitive
benefits; competitive salaries; work/life balance; flexible work hours;
and tuition reimbursement. Of the top 100 companies, 64 expect the number

[0]Spamicles alerts us to a [1]report just issued (PDF) by the House
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. At least 88 White House
officials used Republican National Committee email accounts for
government business. The RNC has destroyed at least some of the emails
from 51 of those officials. Law requires emails sent by officials to be
stored or recorded. There is evidence that White House lawyers and the
(current) Attorney General knew of this but [2]did not act to stop it.
>From the article: "These e-mail accounts were used by White House
officials for official purposes, such as communicating with federal
agencies about federal appointments and policies... Given the heavy
reliance by White House officials on RNC e-mail accounts, the high rank
of the White House officials involved, and the large quantity of missing
e-mails, the potential violation of the Presidential Records Act may be
extensive."

A number of readers sent us word about a malware attack that has been
underway since Saturday that began with the compromise of more than 1,100
mostly Italian Web sites. Websense claims that [0]more than 10,000 sites
have been infected by now, 80% of them in Italy. There are indications
that most of the Italian sites are resident at the same large Italian
hosting provider. [1]Trend Micro reports on the attack, which is launched
from a malicious Iframe tag inserted into pages on compromised sites. For
visitors to these sites, this begins a cascade of "drive-by" malware
downloads if one of several targeted vulnerabilities is available and
unpatched. The first page to which visitors are redirected by the Iframe
hosts a recent version of Mpack attack software. Panda has [2]a month-old
report on Mpack (PDF) that provides copious detail about its nefarious
ways.

Recently a study of broadband penetration rates around the world was in
the news, because the [0]US has fallen to 24th place worldwide, at 53%.
Now comes word that the Australian Prime Minister has announced a $1.68
billion (US) plan to [1]move Australia to 99% penetration within two
years. If they accomplish this goal they will be the most-wired nation
(South Korea currently occupies the top spot with 90%). The Prime
Minister's plan was attacked by his political opponents because it would
create a two-tier system with the country's vast (and almost empty)
interior served by wireless at "only" 12 Mbps.

for what the British Board of Film Classification calls its 'unrelenting
focus on stalking and brutal slaying.' 'There is sustained and cumulative
casual sadism in the way in which these killings are committed, and
encouraged, in the game.' The company has six weeks to submit an appeal.
The last game to be refused classification was Carmageddon in 1997. That
decision was later overturned via the appeals process."

Rob writes with a link to a Computer Business Review article on the
negative impact Mozilla COO John Lilly sees Apple is having on Open
Source. Lilly claims that Jobs' recent discussion of Safari on Windows
[0]is an attempt to create a duopoly of browsers (IE and Safari), with
Firefox and the rest on the outside looking in. "The graph 'betrays the
way that Apple, so often looks at the world,' Lilly said. 'But make no
mistake: this wasn't a careless presentation, or an accidental omission
of all the other browsers out there, or even a crummy marketing trick,'
he said. 'Lots of words describe Steve and his Stevenotes, but 'careless'
and 'accidental' do not. This is, essentially, the way they're thinking
about the problem, and shows the users they want to pick up.'" We
discussed [1]an analyst's opinion on this subject this past Friday.

[0]Kurtz'sKompund passed us an article detailing another loss in
Microsoft's licensing push: [1]Red Hat has summarily rejected Redmond's
offer of an alliance. The article also touches on [2]Ubuntu's rejection
of the same offer, which we discussed this past weekend. ZDNet reports on
comments from Mark Shuttleworth and the Red Hat organization, with
Shuttleworth stating "Allegations of 'infringement of unspecified
patents' carry no weight whatsoever. We don't think they have any legal
merit, and they are no incentive for us to work with Microsoft on any of
the wonderful things we could do together." Red Hat was even more blunt,
stating the organization refused to pay an "innovation tax" to the
Microsoft. "Red Hat said there would be no such deal. Referring to
previous statements distancing itself from Microsoft, the company
insisted: 'Red Hat's standpoint has not changed.' The company referenced
a statement written when Microsoft revealed it was partnering with
Novell, saying that its position remained unaltered. Red Hat director of
corporate communications Leigh Day added: 'We continue to believe that
open source and the innovation it represents should not be subject to an
unsubstantiated tax that lacks transparency.' Many open-source followers
argue that Red Hat, as the largest Linux vendor, would have a lot to lose
from partnering with Microsoft."

lymeca writes "LinuxWorld reports that Sun Microsystem's ZFS filesystem
has been converted from its incarnation in OpenSolaris to [0]a module
capable of running in the Linux user-space filsystem project, FUSE.
Because of the license incompatibilities with the Linux kernel, it has
not yet been integrated for distribution within the kernel itself. This
project, called [1]ZFS on FUSE, aims to enable GNU/Linux users to use ZFS
as a process in userspace, bypassing the legal barrier inherent in having
the filesystem coded into the Linux kernel itself. Booting from a ZFS
partition has been confirmed to work. The performance currently clocks in
at about half as fast as XFS, but with all the success [2]the NTFS-3g
project has had creating a high performance FUSE implementation of the
NTFS filesystem, there's hope that performance tweaking could yield a
practical elimination of barriers for GNU/Linux users to make use of all
that ZFS has to offer."

virtual-world group leader: Confident, bold and streetsmart. But after a
few hours he said he was getting tired of using text chat — and asked me
to switch over to Ventrilo, an app that lets gamers chat using
microphones and voice. I downloaded Ventrilo, logged in, dialed him up
and ... realized he was an 11-year-old boy."

| Do Patents Stop Companies From Creating 'Perfect' Products?        |

Chris M writes "In a recent CNET article, the mobile phone editor writes
about what [0]he thinks would make a perfect phone. Unfortunately, as
someone in the comments section points out, much of the technology that
is used in this concept phone belongs to separate companies. 'I'm sorry
to be the Devil's Advocate here, but most of those feautres are patented
to separate companies. It would require almost all the major
manufacturers [working together] to do this, which is highly unlikely.'
Do you think patents are stopping companies from creating 'perfect'
devices, or are there other factors at work?"

An anonymous reader writes "Ars Technica has [0]a concise introduction to
PC-BSD, a FreeBSD derivative that emphasizes ease of use and aims to
convert Windows users. The review describes the installation process,
articulates the advantages of PC-BSD,and reveal some of the challenges

would suggest this distribution to new users provided they had someone to
call in case of a driver malfunction during installation. I would also
recommend PC-BSD to seasoned Unix users that have never tried using
FreeBSD before and would prefer a shallower learning curve before getting
down to business.'"

to come from anywhere you'd expect it to. Wired's money is on [1]the car
of the future coming from NASA. 'New technology that promises to
revolutionize the automobile as we know it is emerging from research
institutions and startups — and these innovations won't set you back
$100,000 like a Tesla will... One experiment involves small electric
motors located in the wheels of the CityCar, a tiny, nimble and
practically silent vehicle with wheels that turn 360 degrees, enabling it
to slip neatly into tight urban parking spaces. Others are looking to
revolutionize the automobile's engine, not replace it.'"

An anonymous reader writes "An article over at ComputerWorld implies that
the EU Privacy Directive, or something like it, will soon be signed into
law here in the USA. The author [0]seems to think this is a good thing,
but I'm not so sure. From the article: 'We've finally come to realize
that self-regulation by industry hasn't worked. The states have stepped
in, creating the same situation of conflicting regulation that led to the
creation of the EU privacy directive. The only question now is if the law
that comes out of Congress will be a small step strictly focused on
breaches, such as S.239, or whether we take the bigger step of forming a
permanent committee under the FTC to monitor privacy as outlined by
S.1178. Either way, the U.S. is finally moving away from the fractured
environment of the past and toward a comprehensive privacy strategy.' Is
it time for a national privacy law or 'Privacy Czar', or are we better
off letting things be?"

slugo writes "Internet search giant Google (GOOG) hopes to [0]speed the
development of plug-in hybrid cars by giving away millions of dollars to
people and companies that have what appear to be practical ways to get
plug-in hybrid automobiles to market faster. 'While many people don't
associate Google with energy, analysts say the fit isn't all that
unnatural. Renewable energy, unlike coal or nuclear, will likely come
from thousands or tens of thousands of different locations. Analysts have
long said that one of the big challenges will be managing that flow into
and out of the nation's electric grid, and that companies that manage the
flow of information are well placed to handle that task.'"
