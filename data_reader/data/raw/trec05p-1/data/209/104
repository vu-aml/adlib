                                        In a scenario vaguely reminiscent of the California energy crisis, most of the news focuses around one big story- the continuing Enron saga.  There&#39;s no lack of stories about the Enron disaster, and each one seems to be more dire than the last.  With Congressional probes, security guards posted at Enron&#39;s headquarters and the recent sacking of an Andersen partner, it looks like the story&#39;s still got a way to play out.  You can keep up with all the latest including Al Massey&#39;s ongoing articles and interviews at Eyeforenergy.
<p>
We&#39;ve got a packed briefing for you this week.  After focusing the last few editions on the developments surrounding deregulation and energy trading in both the US and Europe, we&#39;re taking a closer look at two other issues of interest to the energy community-emissions and weather.  Two of the articles below focus on the growing market in emissions trading-the first a look at the market, how it&#39;s developing, where the money&#39;s to be made, and the second article takes a closer look at the regulations governing the market.  We&#39;ve also got an article on the latest developments in weather trading which seems to be a growing part of many energy traders portfolios and is increasingly popping up on Risk Managers&#39; radar screens.
<p>
All these articles serve as an excellent segue into a few announcements here at Eyeforenergy.  Just a quick reminder about the upcoming European Energy, Weather and Emissions Trading conferences in mid-February.  We&#39;re quickly running out of hotel space, so if you&#39;re planning on registering make sure to do it soon before space runs out.  Also, we&#39;re issuing a call for papers for our upcoming Emissions Trading show in the US... if you&#39;d like to get involved drop our conference Director, Sarah Robinson a line at <a href="mailto:srobinson@eyeforenergy.com">srobinson@eyeforenergy.com</a>.

Although there is still much dissension among the ranks of scientists and environmentalists as to the impact GHG has on the environment, there can be little doubt the earth&#39;s climate is predicted to change because human activities are altering the chemical composition of the atmosphere through the buildup of greenhouse gases – primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.</i><br>
    <br>
    The heat-trapping property of these gases is undisputed. Although uncertainty exists about exactly how earth&#39;s climate responds to these gases, global temperatures are rising.

    <br>
    In article just released, Mr Hodgson says New Zealand produces less than 0.2 per cent of world emissions but emissions per person are the fourth highest in the developed world, including large methane emissions from farming.

    <br>
    The one-page measure would order the Air Resources Board to lower the amount of carbon dioxide -- one of several greenhouse gases -- spewing from the tailpipes of California&#39;s 29 million cars and light trucks.

Defiant in the face of mounting pressures from ex-employees and creditors, Lay said the bankrupt energy trader needs a fresh leader to turn the company around.</i><br>
    <br>
    Lay, faced widening criminal and political investigations, finally agreed with creditors that the company needed new leadership, if it is to emerge from bankruptcy.

    The scheme, which could start as early as July, will almost certainly mean increased electricity bills for consumers, although the Government insists the increase will be small.

    But the initiative to be put forward by the world&#39;s largest emitter of greenhouse gases is likely to spark further international criticism as it links emission cuts to economic growth rates and fails to require companies to carry out reductions.
