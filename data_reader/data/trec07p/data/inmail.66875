            BioQuest Technology's BioShield 75/Wix Cabin Air
                     Filters to be Carried in All
           NAPA Auto Parts and AutoCare Locations Nationwide

            Over 12,000 NAPA Retail Centers Sign On to Carry
                   Innovative Antimicrobial Air Filter

        JUPITER, Fla., June 25, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) --
        BioQuest Technologies, Inc., (Other OTC:BQTG.PK -
        News), a leading developer of innovative,
        environmentally safe antimicrobial products, today
        announced its BioShield 75/Wix Cabin Air Filters will
        be carried by NAPA Auto Parts and its more than 12,000
        retail locations throughout the U.S. NAPA Auto Parts is
        the industry leader in world-class auto parts. NAPA
        filters with BioShield 75 will be available early 2008
        at over 6,000 NAPA Auto Parts stores and 12,000 NAPA
        AutoCare Centers nationwide.

        BioShield 75 uses exclusive patented technology
        developed by scientists for IndusCo Ltd. the
        manufacturing facility and BioQuest Technologies, and
        has been approved by the Environmental Protection
        Agency for a wide variety of uses, including air
        filtration. When treated with BioShield 75, filter
        surfaces are significantly less susceptible to the
        growth of molds, mildew, fungi and odor-causing
        bacteria. BioShield 75 bonds to the filter and is not
        released in the air, making it extremely safe.

        "Our filters are very efficient at cleaning cabin air,"
        said Jim Bruney, Director of CRM -- NAPA Filters. "With
        the addition of BioShield 75, they are now able to
        virtually eliminate the odors, mold and mildew that
        collect on all filters over times. This means a
        cleaner, healthier ride for drivers and passengers."

        BioShield(r) 75 is a revolutionary way of inhibiting
        the growth of mold, mildew, bacteria and fungi. Unlike
        most other antimicrobial agents, which poison the
        microbes, BioShield(r) 75 physically attacks the
        microbes and renders them inert.

        "It is this physical process that makes NAPA Filters
        with BioShield(r) 75 so effective and so safe,'' said
        Joe Mason, president of IndusCo. the manufacturing
        partner of BioQuest Technologies. ``There are no
        poisons involved. There is nothing harmful to humans."

        NAPA Filters provides filters for cars, light and heavy
        duty trucks, diesel pickup trucks, tractors, heavy duty
        construction and off-road and over the road heavy duty
        vehicles.

        "Working with NAPA, the industry leader in auto parts,
        is a very significant event for our company since it
        gives us a major distribution channel with such a well
        established company," said Arne Rotne II, CEO of
        BioQuest Technologies, Inc. "NAPA's brand, fierce
        commitment to quality and excellent reputation from
        Main Street to Wall Street gives our NAPA Filter with
        BioShield 75 product a unique platform on which to
        succeed in a big way. We are very enthusiastic about
        this relationship and believe it will reap financial
        rewards for both parties."

                      BioShield® technology is a spray-on
                      antimicrobial protection for
                      porous, and non-porous surfaces.
                      BioShield® antimicrobial protection
                      gives substrates an added level of
                      protection against damaging
                      microbes such as, bacteria, mold
                      and mildew that can cause stains,
                      odors and product deterioration.

                      The active ingredient in the
                      BioShield® forms a colorless,
                      odorless, positively charged
                      polymer, which chemically bonds to
                      the treated surface. You could
                      think of it as a layer of
                      electrically charged swords. When a
                      microorganism comes in contact with
                      the treated surface, the quaternary
                      amine sword punctures the cell
                      membrane and the electrical charge
                      shocks the cell. Since nothing is
              [Image] transferred to the now dead cell,
                      the antimicrobial doesn't lose
                      strength and the sword is ready for
              [Image] the next cell to contact it. Note
                      that in order for the BioShield®
                      Antimicrobials to continue their
                      effectiveness, normal cleaning of
                      treated surfaces is necessary. Dirt
                      buildup, paint, dead microbes, etc.
                      will cover the treatment
                      prohibiting it from killing

                      BioShield® protection continuously
                      fights the growth of microbes that
                      can cause stains, odors and product
                      degradation. BioShield® protection
                      makes the surfaces in your home
                      easier to clean and keeps them
                      cleaner and fresher between
                      cleanings.

                      BioShield® antimicrobial protection
                      is effective against most common
                      bacteria, yeasts, molds and fungi
                      that cause stains, odors and
                      product degradation.

                                [Image]

              BioShield® protection begins to
              work as soon as the microorganism
              comes into contact with the
              product surface. It then works
              continuously to maintain a
              consistently lower bio-burden than
              would be expected on a surface
              without BioShield® antimicrobial
              protection. Under the right
              conditions, microbes on an
              untreated surface can double every
              20 minutes! BioShield® technology
              is not a disinfectant and is not a
              substitute for normal cleaning
              practices.

              Extensive testing and a long use
              history have shown BioShield®
              surface protection to be safe.
              While it is impossible to say that
              no one will ever experience an
              allergic reaction to anything, it
              is highly unlikely a negative
              experience would be observed

              effectively cleans an extremely
              wide range of oils, greases,

NAPA Retail Centers Sign On to Carry Innovative Antimicrobial Air Filter</font></font></i></center>

<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>JUPITER,
Fla., June 25, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- BioQuest Technologies, Inc., (Other
OTC:BQTG.PK - News)</font></font></font></b><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>,
a leading developer of innovative, environmentally safe antimicrobial products,
today announced its BioShield 75/Wix Cabin Air Filters will be carried
by NAPA Auto Parts and its more than 12,000 retail locations throughout
the U.S. NAPA Auto Parts is the industry leader in world-class auto parts.
NAPA filters with BioShield 75 will be available early 2008 at over 6,000
NAPA Auto Parts stores and 12,000 NAPA AutoCare Centers nationwide.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>BioShield
75 uses exclusive patented technology developed by scientists for IndusCo
Ltd. the manufacturing facility and BioQuest Technologies, and has been
approved by the Environmental Protection Agency for a wide variety of uses,
including air filtration. When treated with BioShield 75, filter surfaces
are significantly less susceptible to the growth of molds, mildew, fungi
and odor-causing bacteria. BioShield 75 bonds to the filter and is not
released in the air, making it extremely safe.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>"Our
filters are very efficient at cleaning cabin air," said Jim Bruney, Director
of CRM -- NAPA Filters. "With the addition of BioShield 75, they are now
able to virtually eliminate the odors, mold and mildew that collect on
all filters over times. This means a cleaner, healthier ride for drivers
and passengers."</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>BioShield(r)
75 is a revolutionary way of inhibiting the growth of mold, mildew, bacteria
and fungi. Unlike most other antimicrobial agents, which poison the microbes,
BioShield(r) 75 physically attacks the microbes and renders them inert.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>"It
is this physical process that makes NAPA Filters with BioShield(r) 75 so
effective and so safe,'' said Joe Mason, president of IndusCo. the manufacturing
partner of BioQuest Technologies. ``There are no poisons involved. There
is nothing harmful to humans."</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>NAPA
Filters provides filters for cars, light and heavy duty trucks, diesel
pickup trucks, tractors, heavy duty construction and off-road and over
the road heavy duty vehicles.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>"Working
with NAPA, the industry leader in auto parts, is a very significant event
for our company since it gives us a major distribution channel with such
a well established company," said Arne Rotne II, CEO of BioQuest Technologies,
Inc. "NAPA's brand, fierce commitment to quality and excellent reputation
from Main Street to Wall Street gives our NAPA Filter with BioShield 75
product a unique platform on which to succeed in a big way. We are very
enthusiastic about this relationship and believe it will reap financial
rewards for both parties."</font></font></font>

<td WIDTH="80%"><b>BioShield&reg; technology</b> is a spray-on antimicrobial
protection for porous, and non-porous surfaces. BioShield&reg; antimicrobial
protection gives substrates an added level of protection against damaging
microbes such as, bacteria, mold and mildew that can cause stains, odors
and product deterioration.&nbsp;
<p>The active ingredient in the BioShield&reg; forms a colorless, odorless,
positively charged polymer, which chemically bonds to the treated surface.
You could think of it as a layer of electrically charged swords. When a
microorganism comes in contact with the treated surface, the quaternary
amine sword punctures the cell membrane and the electrical charge shocks
the cell. Since nothing is transferred to the now dead cell, the antimicrobial
doesn't lose strength and the sword is ready for the next cell to contact
it. Note that in order for the BioShield&reg; Antimicrobials to continue
their effectiveness, normal cleaning of treated surfaces is necessary.
Dirt buildup, paint, dead microbes, etc. will cover the treatment prohibiting
it from killing
<p>BioShield&reg; protection continuously fights the growth of microbes
that can cause stains, odors and product degradation. BioShield&reg; protection
makes the surfaces in your home easier to clean and keeps them cleaner
and fresher between cleanings.
<p>BioShield&reg; antimicrobial protection is effective against most common
bacteria, yeasts, molds and fungi that cause stains, odors and product
degradation.</td>

Under the right conditions, microbes on an untreated surface can double
every 20 minutes! BioShield&reg; technology is not a disinfectant and is
not a substitute for normal cleaning practices.
