Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update - 11/1/2002

This week rating agency Standard & Poor's said innovatively structured collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) will spur the growth of structured finance products in 2002. The agency predicts a market worth more than $500 billion this year. S&P has reacted to the expected growth of such alternative investments by developing criteria for rating debt secured by the market value of hedge funds. And expects that rating these CDOs will encourage a wider investor base for the deals which, to date, have been dominated by niche investors.

Also this week, New York-based interdealer broker GFI launched what a market participant said was the first stage in its effort to create an online OTC electricity derivatives market in North America, via a soft launch in Alberta. Traders will be able to hedge electricity prices using electricity swaps and options, including base, peak and off-peak terms from day-ahead through the forward curve to calendar years via the new system. The broker has already combined voice and electronic brokerage trading in Europe - becoming the leading broker for German electricity. Should the Alberta project prove successful, it is likely that GFI will roll-out the hybrid model across North America, starting in the eastern seaboard area of the US.

In other energy news, Ohio-based utility American Electric Power (AEP) is set to enter the Nordic power market after its London-based European trading arm, AEP Energy Services, assumed operation of Enron's offices in Oslo and Stockholm. AEP gained an established team of 35 former employees of Enron Nordic Energy, which trades power and weather derivatives in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Germany.

Meanwhile, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (Isda) has hit back at calls for more derivatives regulation in the wake of Enron's demise. "Advocating regulation for regulation's sake is bad policy and could severely affect the US's role in global financial activity," said Robert Pickel, Isda chief executive, in a letter to the Wall Street Journal. "If OTC derivatives did not cause the bankruptcy and the bankruptcy does not pose a risk to the markets, the logical conclusion is that there is no argument for additional derivatives regulation. It is unclear... how additional regulation of Enron's derivatives trading operations would have prevented or mitigated Enron's financial difficulties," said Pickel in the letter.

This Appeal has been set up for the immediate families of, and any persons financially dependent on, those attending the Risk Waters financial technology conference on the 106th floor of the north tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, who lost their lives in the terrorist attack. Those attending the conference included many delegates, speakers, sponsors and exhibitors, as well as 16 people working for Risk Waters (UK, EU and US individuals).
The initial trustees of the Appeal Fund will be Peter Field (chairman & chief executive, Risk Waters Group Ltd), Dennis Waters (chairman & chief executive officer, GenomeWeb LLC, and director, Risk Waters Group Ltd ) and Andrew Farley (solicitor, Boodle Hatfield, London). Risk Waters Group Ltd will be able to appoint new or additional trustees.
The trustees of the Fund will have discretion over how and to what extent to benefit individual claimants and their decisions will be final. As long as the trustees act honestly and in good faith they will not be legally liable for the exercise of their discretion nor for any loss that may occur to the funds raised, howsoever caused. The Fund will not itself be a charity, but any surplus will be applied for such charitable purposes as the trustees think most appropriate to commemorate those who died.
