What exactly is q@haas? 


q@haas is a social and political organization with close to 40 active and alumni members. We welcome straight members, as well as gay, lesbian, and everything in between. Last year's club activities included networking events with many of the leading (TOP HAS SUCH OBVIOUS CONNOTATIONS) consulting companies and investment banks as well as a variety of other organizations. Last year q@haas was one of the organizing schools, along with Stanford, UCLA, and Thunderbird, of the 3rd Annual National Gay & Lesbian MBA Conference which had over 400 participants and 20 corporate sponsors.
