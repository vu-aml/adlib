Hi Larry,

here are some general thoughts on proceeding.  Some of the work hinges on getting people focused on getting information/data and people to do the quantitative analysis.  I assume you will have to budget for supporting a Research Group resource (does not have to be a specific person for now, we can draw upon people's expertise as the need comes, but there will be some template and model building work involved).

Thanks, and give me your comments on the memo below.
Vasant
