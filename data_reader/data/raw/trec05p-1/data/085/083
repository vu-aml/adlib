Gerald,
 
I spoke with Nelson about developing consistency in the language for all of our contracts. As for the Notice of Variance section, we would like to use "email, fax, phone or where an agency agreement governs, direct access to Operators" for all of our Reciprocal Keep Whole confirmations. Please feel free to reword, but our intent is to excuse the Producer if we have executed an agency agreement because we are contractually obligated to get that information.
 
Thanks,
Judy

Judy - 
      Thanks for the quick response. Attached are a few wording changes we would offer. Let me know what you think. What is the effective date? 

Thanks,
