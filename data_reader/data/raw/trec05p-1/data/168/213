NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Kevan Barlow <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 12/14/01
Barlow is not a good start in Week 14. He won't do much against a tough Miami defense that will surely limit his red zone production. 

Garrison Hearst <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1164&>, RB SF - Frank Updated 12/14/01
Hearst may not post good rushing numbers against the Dolphins. But the 49ers have often featured him as a receiver to keep defenses off balance, and may use him often as a passing target in Week 14.

Boo Williams <http://football29! 9.! fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=237007&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Williams is now the starter at TE for New Orleans. He will get regular red-zone looks from Aaron Brooks and may catch a few important TD passes during the Fantasy postseason.

Willie Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1234&>, WR NO - Martin Updated 12/14/01
Jackson is an inconsistent Fantasy wideout. But there is no way you should bench a player of his caliber during the Fantasy postseason.

Aaron Brooks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=133233&> , QB NO - Matty Updated 12/14/01
Brooks is a boom-or-bust Fantasy selection in Week 14. If the Rams blitz him often, he may struggle, but he may also trade TDs with Kurt Warner. There is no way, however, you can bench him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Torry Holt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=133310&>, WR STL - Tori Updated 12/14/01
The explosive Holt is a must-start player in Week 14. He will be a regularly featured target for Kurt Warner on Monday Night Football. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 12/14/01
Faulk will have another fine game this week. He is a great start on Monday Night Football against New Orleans. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 12/14/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success this week. Expect fine numbers from him against the NFC West rival Saints on Monday Night Football. 

Dave Moore <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1369&>, TE TB - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Moore hasn't been a quality Fantasy player this year. Look for other options if you need TE help during the Fantasy postseason.

Jacquez Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=12405&>, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Green hasn't been a good Fantasy player this season. Don't use him during your playoffs. Keyshawn Johnson is Tampa Bay's only productive wideout. 

Brad Johnson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1039&>, QB TB - Matty Updated 12/14/01
Johnson has been a mediocre Fantasy QB this year. He may struggle at Chicago this week. Other than Keyshawn Johnson, he doesn't have the weapons necessary to challenge the Bears' secondary. 

David Terrell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&ran! do! m=3415&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Terrell has disappeared from a statistical perspective. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason.

Dez White <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
White hasn't been much of a Fantasy receiver this year. He is not worth starting during the Fantasy playoffs because of his lack of his regular production. 

Jim Miller <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1053&>, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Miller will struggle against the Buccaneers this week. He may throw more than one interception against Tampa Bay. 

Bubba Franks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Franks may be good for a TD catch this week. Green Bay should move the ball rather easily at Tennessee.

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 12/14/01
Schroeder should post good yardage numbers at Tennessee. The Titans' cornerbacks may have trouble with his speed on post and fly routes. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?scri! pt! =players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 12/14/01
Favre should toss at least two TD passes this week. He will certainly exploit every weakness in the vulnerable Tennessee pass defense. 

Johnnie Morton <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1223&>, WR DET - Hunter Updated 12/14/01
Morton should reach the 100-yard receiving mark this week. The Minnesota secondary won't be able to handle the veteran receiver, especially on slant and post routes. 

Mike McMahon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01 If you desperate for QB help, consider McMahon this week. He may fare well against the awful Minnesota defense.

Byron Chamberlain <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1496&>, TE MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Chamberlain has been unreliable recently. Still, he is worth starting because the Vikings will face the inconsistent Detroit defense this week. 

Cris Carter <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 12/14/01
Carter should post respectable, if not spectacular numbers this week. He will find the Detroit secondary very easy to work against.

Randy Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 12/14/01
Moss is an excellent start in Week 14. He should catch at least one TD pass against the Lions.

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Bouman is expected to start again in place of the injured Daunte Culpepper this week. He should find the end zone at least twice against the hapless Lions. 

Rod Gardner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Gardner has been a servicable Fantasy player this year, but don't count on him to find the end zone against the tough Philadelphia secondary this week. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Westbrook will face a very tough matchup in Week 14. Don't expect him to break loose from Philadelphia CB Bobby Taylor very often.

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Don't start Banks in Week 14. He will struggle against the Philadelphia secondary,! a! nd he may take several coverage sacks and big hits. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Russell Updated 12/14/01
Expect at least one TD catch from Hilliard this week. The Giants should be able to exploit the holes in Arizona's secondary with regular strikes to Hilliard and Amani Toomer.

Amani Toomer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 12/14/01
Tommer is a good start in Week 14. He will regularly challenge the Arizona secondary with his quickness and separation speed. 

Frank Sanders <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Sanders hasn't been a much of a factor in the Arizona offense this year. Avoid using him during the Fantasy playoffs.

Jake Plummer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Frank Updated 12/14/01
Plummer may struggle on the road this week. The Giants may dominate a home matchup with the Cardinals.
