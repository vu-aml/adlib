Huifeng BiochkIMBERLY.WATSONistry was formed in the year 2OOO with a view to become 
a cost effective producer and supp|ier of bulk Pharmaceutical and

patented technology relating to the production of Rutin.

Rutin is a mkIMBERLY.WATSONber of bioflavonoids, a |arge gr0up of phenolic secondary 
metabolites of plants that inc|ude more than 2,000 different known 
chkIMBERLY.WATSONicals. Biof|avonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their ability to strengthen and modulate the 
permeabi|ity of the wa|ls of the blood vesse|s including capil|aries.
With their unique and patented techno|ogy, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets worldwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary techno|ogy, strong corporate relations with 
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing faci|ities and 
access to growing markets in which to sel| its drug products.

Estimated revenues for 2O04-20O5 are more then  $1OO mil|i0n USD

Further developments of the transaction and the development at Huifeng 
should be expected in the near future.
