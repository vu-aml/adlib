Rob Cooper (of US Gypsum) asked me to send him an email concerning our decision to not to force USG to provide the remaining 8 months of LOC and also asked me to verify a couple of other points.  Below is my reply.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  Paul, please provide the dollar amount needed in the blank below.

Rob,

After reviewing the current status of United States Gypsum Company and Transwestern's status as a creditor of Administrative Claims, we will not proceed in seeking the additional $___________ letter of credit (worth approximately 8 months of reservation charges).  The current letter of credit valued at $__________ is sufficient.

Also, our timing for the completion of the Red Rock Expansion that will make this capacity available is still on schedule for June 1, 2002.  In our latest discussions with SOCAL, they have indicated that their expansion of the SOCAL Needles delivery point will be completed by that time.  It would probably be best for you to discuss this with them yourself to verify its availability completely and thoroughly.

Please call me if you have any additional questions.

Best regards,

Mark
