Mike,
Here is the variable cost sheet you had sent me a while back.  I linked all of the products to Reuters.  In order to get the product prices to update real time you need to have Reuters open on your computer.  Take a look at it and if you like it we can get it on the plasma.  Sorry this has taken so long, our Reuters people aren't exactly the quickest when it comes to adding products.  Anyway, let know.

Aaron
