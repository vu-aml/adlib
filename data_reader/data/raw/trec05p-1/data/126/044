Michelle,

We are wanting to rescind Michael Slayton's offer of employment in Marlin Gubser's group.  He is currently working at New Power and his start date with Enron is December 28th.  He has not given notice because he has an agreement with New Power to stay on his current project until the end of the year.  He has already signed and returned his offer letter. Marlin feels that Michael is a non-essential hire and would like to rescind his offer . Please advise how we should handle this situation.

Thanks,
Becky Quintana
Enron Technology Recruiter
