FROM: MRS MARIAM ABACHA
ABUJA- NIGERIA.
email:  abachafamily557@katamail.com

ATTN: SIR/MADAM,

It is my pleasure to contact you in a situation like this, I know that 
the content of this letter might be a surprise to you, but even though 
we hardly know each other, but i believe that you can help me.

I am Mrs. Mariam Abacha, the widow of the late Gen.Sanni Abacha former 
Nigerian Military Head of
State who died mysteriously as a result of Cardiac Arrest.

Since my husbands death, my family has been under restriction of 
movement and that not withstanding, we are being molested, policed and 
our bank account both here and abroad are being frozen by the Nigerian 
government. All this is because the present Nigerian President was put 
in prison by my husband when he was found guilty of plotting a coup to 
over-throw my husband. All my husband friends refuse to come to our 
aid because of fear of the President and for governmental positions 
which he had offered them.

Following the recent discovery of my husbands Bank Account by the 
Nigerian government with Swiss
Bank in which the huge sum of US$700 Million and DM450 Million was 
logged. I therefore decided to
contact you in confidence that l was able to move out the sum of 
US$30.8 Million Dollars, which
was secretly sealed in Two Metal Boxes for Security Reasons and was 
deposited with a safe Deposit Company outside Nigeria through their 
diplomatic service for safe Keeping.

Please you can visit these websites and read more about my late 
husband and you will understand
what I am telling you.

www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=42764&SelectRegion=West_Africa

I personally appeal to you seriously and religiously for your urgent 
assistance to move this money into your country where l believe It 
will be safe since l cannot leave the country due
to the restriction of movement imposed on the members of my family by 
the Nigeria Government.

I have made necessary arrangement with an Attorney who will arrange 
all the documents that covers this consignment, you will have to met 
with him the security company were this consignment will be release to 
you, and liaise with you towards effective completion of this money 
out of the country. Once you indicate your interest towards assisting 
us, I will direct you to the Attorney who shall send you the contact 
information of the company together with secret code of the 
consignment and other related documents that will help you claim the 
consignment.

Conclusively, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the total sum while 
75% is to be held on trust by you until we regain our freedom from the 
Nigerian Government and 5% for any expenses that you will make during 
this transaction. Also we have decided to
establish a mutual business investments with our own share in your 
country in which you will monitor on our behalf subsequent to our free 
movement by the Nigerian government.

Please kindly reply to this email address urgently and treat this 
transaction with absolute confidentiality and sincerity.

Best Regards.
MRS.MARIAM ABACHA
