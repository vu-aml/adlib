Last night I attended the District D Capital Improvement Prep Session,
Northwest Quadrant, which was also a Super Neighborhood meeting. I was
wearing my two new hats as a representative of the East Montrose Civic
Association and a member of Ada Edwards' District D Infrastructure Action
Team.  Mike Shannon from the city's finance and administration--the
people we have to send our CIP requests to--and David Leal an engineer
from the city's Public Works and Engineering departament were there.  


The Bomar and Morgan high water problem was the only issue I addressed. 
I have some Citizen Request Forms. If someone from the Bomar-Morgan spot
would like to fill one out or help me fill one out, I can hand deliver it
to city hall.  This isn't a bad idea, and it might, possibly result in
something being done between 2003 and 2007.


But I think it's also urgent that we try to get something done now.  Both
Shannon and Leal agreed that it was a good idea to try to work through
our council members at the same time to try to get something done.  As I
explained last night, we don't know what needs to be done: Is there a
storm sewer under Bomar in that block and should there be a drain at that
spot?  (I personally believe in a flat place like Houston and with
Houston's construction and maintenance crews what they are, the best way
to get water away from your property is a ditch.)  


If I can get a copy of the engineer's letter, I'd like to get it to Mr.
Leal.

gutters, which are missing in many if not most innercity neighborhoods.
