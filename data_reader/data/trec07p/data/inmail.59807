PETREAUS: "A LOT OF HEAVY LIFTING TO DO" IN IRAQ: Conditions in Iraq will not improve sufficiently by September to
justify a drawdown of U.S. military forces, the top commander in Iraq said yesterday. Asked whether he thought the job
assigned to an additional 30,000 troops deployed as the centerpiece of President Bush's new war strategy would be
completed by then, Gen. David H. Petraeus replied: "I do not, no. I think that we have a lot of heavy lifting to do."
Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, his diplomatic counterpart in Baghdad, said a key report they will deliver to
Washington in September will include what Crocker called "an assessment of what the consequences might be if we pursue
other directions." Noting the "unhelpful roles" being played by Iran and Syria in Iraq, Crocker said: "We've got to
consider what could happen." Washington Post: Petraeus: Iraq 'Challenges' to Last for Years

McCONNELL ON IMMIGRATION: "HARD TO KNOW IF THE VOTES WILL BE THERE": The Senate's top Republican yesterday said the
fate of the immigration bill is still in doubt as he and the Senate's top Democrat revive it and force it back on the
schedule this week. "It's hard to know if the votes will be there to pass it or not," said Minority Leader Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky. Last week, Mr. McConnell agreed to buck many of his party's conservatives and force a limit to
the number of amendments they want to offer to the immigration bill. In exchange, Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada
Democrat, agreed to put the bill back on the schedule. The bill had foundered a week earlier when members of both
parties demanded more time to offer amendments. Washington Times: McConnell unsure of immigration bill

PELOSI OPTIMISTIC PACKAGE COULD PASS IN HOUSE: Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed optimism the House would approve a plan
to overhaul U.S. immigration law if it gets through the Senate first. "We want it to be bipartisan and comprehensive,"
Pelosi said in an interview on Bloomberg Television's "Political Capital with Al Hunt." Asked if the House would pass
the measure currently before the Senate, she said, "with some modification. But we'll work together in a bipartisan
way." Pelosi, a California Democrat, said the legislation must get the support of 50 to 70 Republicans in the House.
That doesn't mean an equal number of Democrats would withhold support, she added. "It just means we'd like to see a
show of bipartisanship." Bloomberg: Pelosi Expresses Optimism for House Action on Immigration Law

ATTORNEY FALLOUT "COMPLICATING LIFE" FOR PROSECUTORS ACROSS U.S.: For months, the Justice Department and Atty. Gen.
Alberto R. Gonzales have taken political heat for the purge of eight U.S. attorneys last year. Now the fallout is
starting to hit the department in federal courtrooms around the country. Defense lawyers in a growing number of cases
are raising questions about the motives of government lawyers who have brought charges against their clients. In court
papers, they are citing the furor over the U.S. attorney dismissals as evidence that their cases may have been infected
by politics. Los Angeles Times: U.S. attorneys fallout seeps into courts

WILL BUSH PARDON LIBBY TO "REASSERT HIMSELF"?: White House loyalists have begun arguing that clemency for I. Lewis
"Scooter" Libby -- either a pardon or a commuted sentence -- would be a way for an embattled President Bush to reassert
himself, particularly among conservatives. The White House has not ruled out a pardon for Libby, sources say. But
several Republicans, who sense a movement in Libby's favor, said a more likely possibility might be a presidential
commutation -- a reduction or elimination of Libby's 2½-year federal prison sentence. Such a move, they said, would be
less divisive for the country. The Politico: Pressure mounts for Libby clemency

DEMS LOOKING FOR "MAJOR REVERSAL" ON ENERGY: Senate Democrats are seeking a major reversal of energy tax policies that
would take billions of dollars in tax breaks and other benefits from the oil industry to underwrite renewable fuels.
The tax increases would reverse incentives passed as recently as three years ago to increase domestic exploration and
production of oil and gas. The change reflects a shift from the Republican focus on expanding oil production to the
Democratic concern about reducing global warming. On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee will take up a bill that
would raise about $14 billion from oil companies over 10 years and would give about the same amount of money on new
incentives for solar power, wind power, cellulosic ethanol and numerous other renewable energy sources. The bill is one
of the signature issues this year for Democrats, along with immigration and the war in Iraq, and one in which they hope
to clearly distinguish themselves from the Republicans. New York Times: Democrats Press Plan to Channel Billions in Oil
Subsidies to Renewable Fuels http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/18/washington/18oil.html

GOP'S '08 CONGRESSIONAL PROSPECTS HAVE "MARKEDLY IMPROVED": Republican campaign strategists and independent election
analysts say that after five months of contentious House Democratic rule, the Republican Party's once-bleak
congressional prospects for 2008 have markedly improved. The Democratic Congress' job approval score is now worse than
President Bush's, plummeting to 23 percent, a drop of eight points since April. House Democrats have been forced to
retreat in the face of a furious assault by Republicans on pork-barrel spending, an issue that hurt the Republican
Party in November. And Republican recruiting has produced plenty of candidates eyeing weak Democratic freshmen in
Republican-leaning districts that swept them into office last year. Washington Times: Democratic Congress shows cracks

WEBB ACKNOWLEDGES IT WAS HIS GUN AIDE BROUGHT INTO SENATE BUILDING: Sen. Jim Webb has dispelled any lingering mystery
about it: The pistol involved in the arrest of a top Webb aide was the senator's. "It's my gun," Webb, D-Va.,
acknowledged in an interview last week. Webb declined again to talk about whether he complies with the District of
Columbia handgun ban. Almost six months into his first term, the writer, lawyer and Marine Corps veteran of Vietnam War
combat agreed to an interview that touched an array of topics. They ranged from the gun episode, Iraq and presidential
politics... Webb aide Phillip Thompson was arrested on an illegal-handgun charge when he carried a loaded pistol in a
briefcase into a Senate office building. Webb hinted afterward at an innocent mix-up and refused to say who owned the
gun, though Thompson had told police it was Webb's. A U.S. prosecutor later dropped the charge. Richmond

IOWA'S INFLUENTIAL ROLE SLIPPING? In the course of a week, the Ames straw poll went from a closely watched early test
of the Republican presidential campaigns in the leadoff caucus state to a face-off between mostly lesser-known
candidates. Decisions by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani to skip the high-profile Iowa Republican Party
fundraising event and by Arizona Sen. John McCain to abandon his plans to compete in the straw poll could signal the
end of the mid-August event's relevance. And that could reduce the amount of money the state GOP will have for its
campaigns next year. The decisions by Giuliani and McCain, who rank among the leaders in national and Iowa polls, have
also prompted questions about whether Iowa's influential role setting the tone for the presidential nominating campaign
is slipping. Des Moines Register: Straw poll no-shows zap Iowa's relevance, some fear

CLINTON HAS DOUBLE-DIGIT LEAD; THOMPSON SLIDES INTO SECOND PLACE: New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton has regained a
double-digit lead over Illinois Sen. Barack Obama in the USA TODAY/Gallup Poll two weeks after the survey found the
Democratic presidential rivals essentially tied. Among Republicans, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani remains
ahead, but former Tennessee senator Fred Thompson, who hasn't formally entered the race, for the first time edges into
second place over Arizona Sen. John McCain. The results show a Republican race that could be roiled by Thompson, who is
targeting conservatives unsatisfied with their choices in the field so far. He is costing Giuliani most: A third of
Thompson's supporters say they would otherwise back the former mayor. USA Today: Poll: Clinton establishes sizable lead
over Obama http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2007-06-17-clinton-poll_N.htm

McCAIN PAYING A FUNDRAISING PRICE FOR ALIENATING KEY CASH SOURCES: A ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services
Committee like Senator John McCain could normally bank on a bonanza of campaign contributions from the defense
industry, especially if he was under pressure to raise money fast. But as Mr. McCain races to play catch-up with his
Republican presidential primary rivals before the end of the second quarter, he is only reminding military companies
and lobbyists why they have never liked him. "Defense contractors are more concerned with winning the next contract
than performing on the current one," he charged at a recent campaign stop. At a critical moment for him, his
presidential campaign may be paying the price for a career of positions seemingly calculated to alienate constituencies
that according to Washington custom should be prime sources of campaign cash. Mr. McCain's campaign filings show just
$61,000 from the military industry in the first quarter — less than half as much as the long-shot campaign of
Democratic Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. New
York Times: Taking On Biggest Donors, McCain Takes a Big Risk

ROMNEY HAS "SEIZED THE ADVANTAGE" IN "STATES THAT COUNT": Forget the national polls for Mitt Romney. Slowly,
methodically, the Republican presidential contender has seized the advantage in the early states that count, relying on
a solid organization, $4 million in advertising and an aggressive approach. It's propelled him to the top of polls in
the caucus and primary sites of Iowa and New Hampshire, and laid the foundation for what some analysts argue is greater
success. "Mitt Romney is now positioned as the front-runner for the nomination," said Scott Reed, who managed Bob
Dole's 1996 presidential campaign. "There's a long way to go, but to date he's running the most logical, thought-out,
structured campaign. He's marching in the right cadence, he's raising the money, he's spending it wiser and he seems to
be on track." AP via Yahoo! News: Romney builds support in early states

"A REPUBLICAN ROCK STAR": Long-haired rocker Ted Nugent prepared to take center stage at the Burlington Steamboat Days
on Sunday night, but first it was short-haired fellow conservative Mitt Romney's turn to play to this riverfront town.
Romney has become a Republican rock star, leading some polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, key states in a race that still
is more than a year away from decision day. The former Massachusetts governor wrapped up a three-day swing through Iowa
that focused mainly on his family values platform. He seemed content at this point in the race to ride the early
momentum he has from a well-organized Iowa campaign and his frequent appearances in the leadoff caucus state. Des
Moines Register: On S.E. Iowa trek, Romney keeps the focus on family
http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070618/NEWS09/706180335/1056

IA IS THE PLACE WHERE EDWARDS BID WILL "RISE OR FALL": Four years ago — facing what seemed to be a certain defeat in
the Iowa Democratic caucuses — John Edwards recast his presidential campaign with weeks to go before the vote,
unveiling an emotionally powerful speech about poverty that he delivered relentlessly across the state. Mr. Edwards
came within a few thousand votes of victory. To this day, he tells associates he would have won with another week. This
year, Mr. Edwards has picked up where he left off in 2004. He visited 14 places in Iowa in the course of three days
this weekend, an itinerary reflecting just how much he has settled on this state as the place where his bid for the
Democratic presidential nomination will rise or fall. New York Times: Staking His Campaign on Iowa, Edwards Makes a
Populist Pitch to the Left http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/18/us/politics/18campaign.html

NEVADA IS "CRITICAL" TO RICHARDSON: Gov. Bill Richardson has found a second home in Nevada. The two-hour flight is not
a short hop from the New Mexico governor's mansion in Santa Fe, but Richardson hopes Nevada will become a critical
aspect of his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. "You're now important," he told a group of Las Vegas
Democrats last week. "You used to not be that important." The decision by Nevada Democrats to move their caucuses to
Jan. 19, 2008, making them second after Iowa's on the party's nominating calendar, was supposed to make the state --
better known for gamblers and showgirls -- a prime destination for presidential candidates. But so far, the gregarious
New Mexico governor has been the only one to make it a priority. Washington Post: Richardson Is Counting on Nevada, a
State He Has to Himself http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/17/AR2007061700935.html

20 YEARS AFTER FIRST RUN, BIDEN HIGHLIGHTS EXPERIENCE: Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., in a dark suit whose jacket he will
soon shed, steps out of a dark SUV about an hour and a half late for a house party at Jack and Kay Kibbie's place. Jack
Kibbie is a corn and soybean farmer, but more to the point, president of the Iowa state Senate — and for any Democrat
aspiring to the White House, a valuable endorsement. He would have been here sooner, Biden explains to Kibbie, but
there was a little, ah, problem as his plane came in from Des Moines. "You're not gonna believe this," Biden says,
plainly enjoying the moment. "We got about to the treetops, and the pilot says, 'Oops. Can't land here. Too windy.'" So
Biden's plane made a detour, and he arrived to make his pitch for the Democratic presidential nomination a bit later
than he'd planned. About 20 years later than he'd planned, if you want to get metaphorical about it. Los Angeles Times:
Lessons learned on Joe Biden's second run http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-biden18jun18,0,6035111.story

COOL CODE NAME: Sen. Barack Obama has a new tag: "Renegade." That's what Secret Service agents are calling the Illinois
Democrat, in the time-honored tradition of giving "secret" code names to presidential candidates and other protected
dignitaries. As is custom, the Obama moniker reflects something of the man himself (though he might prefer
"progressive" or "independent"). Is the same true for a woman? Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) may hope so. Her
code name is "Evergreen," given to her when her husband (former president Bill Clinton, a.k.a. "Eagle") first became a
protectee. President Bush, a protectee dating back to the days when his father was president (and with a reputation for
rowdiness before he became a teetotaler) is "Tumbler." Former president Jimmy Carter, who taught Sunday school, is
"Deacon." George H.W. Bush is "Timberwolf," and Ronald Reagan was "Rawhide." Washington Post: 'Renegade' Joins Race For
White House http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/16/AR2007061601079.html

NOT MUCH LAWMAKER SUPPORT FOR "QUIXOTIC" KUCINICH BID: Last week when Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) held a news
conference to tout the growing momentum for his resolution calling for the impeachment of Vice President Cheney, Rep.
Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) stood by his side. But when it comes to Congressional support for his quixotic presidential
campaign — the centerpiece of which he has made ending the Iraq War — the leftist Congressman stands alone. Kucinich is
active in both the Congressional Progressive Caucus as well as the Out of Iraq Caucus. But none of the 72 Progressive
Caucus members — and no Member of Congress for that matter — has endorsed Kucinich's 2008 bid. For his part, the
six-term lawmaker says he wouldn't have it any other way. Roll Call: Kucinich Stands Alone: Progressive Members Have
Yet to Support His White House Bid http://www.rollcall.com/issues/52_141/news/18993-1.html
