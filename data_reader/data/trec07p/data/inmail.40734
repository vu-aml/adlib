ROUND II WITH ISG? After an initially tepid reception from policymakers, the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group
are getting a second look from the White House and Congress, as officials continue to scour for bipartisan solutions to
salvage the American engagement in Iraq. With negotiations continuing this week on a new war funding bill, the
administration is strongly signaling that it would accept the idea of requiring the Iraqi government to meet political
benchmarks or else risk losing some assistance from the United States. That was one of the key proposals from the group
headed by former secretary of state James A. Baker III and former Indiana congressman Lee H. Hamilton, but it was
initially dismissed by the White House when first proposed last December. Washington Post: Second Life for Study Group
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/20/AR2007052001406.html

"SPECIAL TREAT" FOR NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: President Bush is banking on NATO support to help quell the violence in
Afghanistan as he meets with the alliance's leader to review strategy on a flurry of issues. Secretary-General Jaap de
Hoop Scheffer has met privately with Bush a handful of times, but never before at the president's getaway in central
Texas. The invitation was meant to be a special treat, an offer of extended personal time with Bush. Afghanistan's
surging violence, NATO's role in Kosovo and U.S. plans for a missile defense system in Europe all were likely to be on
Monday's agenda. On Sunday, a relaxed Bush and first lady Laura Bush greeted de Hoop Scheffer and his wife, Jeannine,
who arrived by helicopter. The president, in blue jeans and cowboy boots, then climbed into his extended-cab pickup
truck and drove the couples down the road - men in the front seat, women in the back seat. AP via Yahoo! News: Bush
meets NATO leader at Texas ranch http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070521/ap_on_go_pr_wh/bush

HOUSE IMMIGRATION CAUCUS SAYS DEAL "VIOLATES THE RULE OF LAW": Members of the Congressional Immigration Caucus say a
compromise reached between members of the Senate and the Bush administration over immigration reform violates the rule
of law, giving amnesty to millions of illegal aliens in the United States. "The compromise... will reward 12 million
illegal immigrants with a path to citizenship -- what part of 'illegal' does the Senate not understand?" asked Rep.
Brian P. Bilbray, California Republican and caucus chairman. "Any plan that rewards illegal behavior is amnesty. "You
would think the Senate would have learned their lesson after the 1986 amnesty debacle, but it looks like their idea of
a compromise is to repeat the failed policies of the past," he said. Rep. Lamar Smith, Texas Republican and ranking
member of the House Judiciary Committee, said the proposed compromise would "do lasting damage to the country, American
workers and the rule of law." He said amnesty puts lawbreakers ahead of those legally seeking citizenship, puts foreign
workers ahead of U.S. workers and encourages more illegal immigration. Washington Times: Caucus criticizes plan for
'amnesty' http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20070521-121929-9507r.htm

EMPLOYERS "UNHAPPY" WITH IMMIGRATION PACKAGE: Employers, who helped shape a major immigration bill over the last three
months, said on Sunday that they were unhappy with the result because it would not cure the severe labor shortages they
foresee in the coming decade. In addition, employers expressed alarm as they learned that the Senate bill would require
them to check a government database to verify that all current and former employees - aliens and citizens alike - were
eligible to work in the United States. The Senate begins debating the bill on Monday. Supporters, including the White
House, had hoped that senators would finish work on it this week, before the Memorial Day recess. But leading members
of Congress said Sunday that the bill would take more time and could face significant hurdles. New York Times: After
Aiding Bill on Immigration, Employers Balk http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/21/washington/21immig.html

IMMIGRATION ISSUE HIGHLIGHTS DIFFERENCES AMONG GOP TOP TIER: As Congress begins debate on a complex immigration bill,
the leading Republican candidates for president have finally found a policy issue to squabble over. The chief
differences have emerged between Senator McCain of Arizona, who helped forge a fragile agreement with Senator Kennedy
in the Senate, and Mitt Romney, who quickly came out against the bill and derided it as a form of "amnesty" for illegal
immigrants. In the middle is Mayor Giuliani, who has joined many politicians on both sides of the aisle in taking a
wait-and-see approach to the bill, which may face a slew of amendments in the Senate. Such a clear distinction on a
policy matter has been rare among the top three Republican hopefuls, with the exception of social issues such as
abortion, on which Mr. Giuliani has parted ways with his rivals. New York Sun: GOP Presidential Hopefuls Square Off
Over Immigration http://www.nysun.com/article/54862

ROGERS WILL TRIGGER VOTE ON MURTHA REPRIMAND: The House floor will be the stage for a partisan fight over earmarks and
ethics today, as Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) is scheduled to drop a privileged motion to trigger a House vote on whether
to reprimand senior Rep. John Murtha (D-Pa.) for allegedly threatening to deny Rogers' earmarks for "now and forever."
The Michigan lawmaker said last week that Murtha had vowed to cut his earmarks in retaliation for Rogers' attempt to
strip a Murtha project from the intelligence authorization bill the week before. Murtha has declined to offer his
version of events. Once Rogers offers the resolution, Democrats have four procedural options. The most likely, aides
said, is a motion to table the resolution that effectively kills the bill. They also can debate the resolution and then
vote to table it, refer it to the ethics committee or allow an up-or-down vote. Roll Call: Rogers, Murtha to Battle
Over Alleged Earmarks Threat http://www.rollcall.com/issues/52_128/news/18584-1.html

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY'S "NO. 1 CRITIC": "Are you kidding me?" says Senator Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican, when
asked why he's so critical of insurance companies. Lott, 65, launches into a critique of the industry, peppering it
with words such as "arrogant" and "mean- spirited," statistics about company profits and executive pay and angry
questions about why its lobbyists are fighting a clutch of bills he is pushing -- including one that would strip
companies such as State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. and Allstate Corp. of their 62-year-old exemption from
federal antitrust laws. The Senate's No. 2 Republican has become the industry's No. 1 critic in Congress ever since he
lost a house to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. While Lott recently settled with his insurer, State Farm, after a year-long
court battle, he is continuing the fight in the Senate. His experience, the senator says, has convinced him that an
industry he defended his entire career is in need of reform. Bloomberg: Lott, 'Scorned' After Katrina, Targets State
Farm, Allstate http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&sid=aYjjIGyPeitA

BRAUN ATTACKER CHARGED: A South Side man was charged Sunday with attacking former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun in
April after she identified him in a lineup, Chicago police said. Joseph A. Dixon, 38, of the 6100 block of South Drexel
Avenue, was charged with aggravated battery and attempted armed robbery Sunday evening, police said. Dixon was arrested
Friday after money was taken from a tip jar in a Subway restaurant at 1449 E. 57th St. in Hyde Park, Sgt. Nancy Higgins
said. Once he was in police custody, he became a person of interest in Braun's attempted robbery. Braun, the first
African-American woman elected to the U.S. Senate, was attacked and injured around midnight on April 27 outside her
Hyde Park home in the 1200 block of East 56th Street, police said. Braun fell to the ground in the struggle and broke
her wrist. Chicago Tribune: Man charged in Braun case

ONLINE POPULARITY GAP: No Republican comes close to matching the popularity of another Democratic candidate, Sen.
Barack Obama of Illinois, on YouTube, MySpace and Facebook, the social-networking triumvirate. The Democrats are ahead
in the online money race. The top three Democrats, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, Obama and Edwards, amassed more than
$14 million over the Internet in the first three months of 2007; in contrast, the top three Republicans, Giuliani,
McCain and Romney, collected less than half of that, $6 million. Furthermore, ABC PAC, the conservative fundraising
site, has raised $385 so far for Republican presidential hopefuls; Act Blue, its liberal counterpart, has collected
about $3 million for Edwards alone. One reason for the disparity between the parties, political insiders say, is that
the top Republican candidates are not exciting voters the way the Democratic front-runners are. Washington Post:
Online, GOP Is Playing Catch-Up http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/20/AR2007052001408.html

RICHARDSON CALLS ATTENTION TO MEXICAN ROOTS: A couple of months ago a reporter in Washington asked Democratic
presidential candidate Bill Richardson why he thought he could do well next year in the California primary. Richardson,
the governor of New Mexico, paused for a moment, stared at his questioner, and then ran through a comprehensive,
policy-oriented list: Western governor, strong on environment, solid on immigration, pro-growth to please the Silicon
Valley folks, and so on. He paused. Leaned forward. "Plus I'm Hispanic," he said. "Did you know that?" He was teasing,
but it's a real strategic issue for a candidate with a vanilla name. Washington Post: The Pro-Familia Candidate
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/20/AR2007052001407.html

MOTHER OF KILLED MARINE CHALLENGES STORY IN RICHARDSON'S STUMP SPEECH: On the campaign trail, presidential hopeful Bill
Richardson tells a moving story about a New Mexico Marine killed in Iraq and his mom. But is it true? Three years ago,
Richardson attended a memorial service for Lance Cpl. Aaron Austin, 21, who died in April 2004. As he campaigns for the
Democratic nomination, the New Mexico governor often recounts an emotional conversation with Austin's mother, saying
she thanked him for the federal death benefits she had received and even showed him the government check. In speeches
in New Hampshire, Richardson has gotten Austin's name wrong at least once and age wrong at least twice. He also has
called Austin the first New Mexico soldier killed in Iraq - instead of the third. But that's not what bothers the
Marine's mother, De'on Miller, of Lovington, N.M., who says the conversation about money never took place. AP via
Yahoo! News: Marine's mom disputes Richardson story http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070520/ap_on_el_pr/richardson_marine

ROMNEY LEADS IN DES MOINES REGISTER POLL: Mitt Romney has sprinted ahead of presidential competitors John McCain and
Rudy Giuliani in a new Iowa Poll of likely Republican caucus participants. The Des Moines Register poll shows Romney, a
former Massachusetts governor, is the top choice of 30 percent of those who say they definitely or probably will attend
the leadoff Iowa caucuses in January. McCain, a U.S. senator from Arizona, nips former New York Mayor Giuliani for
second place — 18 percent to 17 percent. Other polls taken in Iowa this month, presenting a different lineup of
candidates that included Newt Gingrich and Fred Thompson, have shown Giuliani, McCain and Romney bunched together. The
former U.S. House speaker and former Tennessee senator have said they are considering presidential bids but have not
taken steps toward running. Des Moines Register: Mitt Romney leads Republicans

CLINTON TO ROLL OUT UNIVERSAL PRE-K PROPOSAL: Two presidential candidates plan to unveil significant domestic policy
proposals today, with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton calling for a $5 billion plan for universal prekindergarten
classes and Senator John McCain urging more efficiency and ethics in government. Mrs. Clinton, Democrat of New York,
will visit an elementary school in Miami today to propose her first major education initiative of the campaign: a
federal fund to help states create or expand universal pre-K programs. The program would be voluntary for states, which
would be required to provide a dollar-for-dollar match and would not be allowed to reduce their current spending on
pre-K, according to a summary of the plan provided yesterday by the Clinton campaign. New York Times: 2 Candidates to
Roll Out Domestic Proposals http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/21/us/politics/21candidate.html

McCAIN TO TALK GOVERNMENT REFORM IN OK: Republican presidential hopeful John McCain is promising to hold Cabinet chiefs
accountable for ensuring the integrity of their agencies and proposing to withhold money from government programs that
don't meet performance expectations. "It is essential to our party's success, and to the nation's honor that we claim
sincerely the mantle of reform," the Arizona Republican says in a speech he plans to give Monday at the Oklahoma
statehouse in Oklahoma City. "We were elected the majority in Congress thirteen years ago for that reason more than any
other: to reform the way government is funded and structured, and to hold it accountable for its ability or inability
to address the serious challenges of our time," McCain says, six months after Republicans lost power of the House and
Senate. AP via Yahoo! News: McCain to push GOP on government reform
http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070521/ap_on_el_pr/mccain_government

GIULIANI TESTING CLOUT OF CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVE LEADERS: Bill Carswell has voted for numerous Republican presidential
candidates who oppose abortion, even though he supports legal abortion... "It's a personal decision. It's up to the
individual." Carswell says he votes "for leadership" and that's why he overlooked the anti-abortion views of Ronald
Reagan, George W. Bush and others. The big question now is whether social conservatives are willing to make the same
calculation as they weigh who would be their party's strongest nominee. At least two prominent figures — Focus on the
Family President James Dobson and Republican strategist Richard Viguerie — already have supplied an answer. They won't
vote for Giuliani. "I will personally work to defeat the GOP ticket in 2008" if he is the nominee, Viguerie said. For
decades, Christian conservatives have turned out in Republican primudles and had great influence. Giuliani's candidacy
is testing their clout, and some analysts predict it will be a turning point. USA Today: GOP's commitment on social
issues tested http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20070521/a_religiousright21.art.htm
