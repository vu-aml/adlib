ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

PREVIEW for October 21, 2001

======================================

Dear Folks -

   There is a story told in Buddhism of a monk who was fleeing a tiger. 
He ran to the edge of a cliff and, being unable to stop himself, went 
over the edge. He caught the branch of a tree on his way down. He 
looked down and way below on the ground was another tiger. He glanced 
aside and saw a strawberry on a bush growing from the edge of the cliff 
beside him. He let go of the limb with one hand, picked the strawberry 
and savored it.

   This story is told as an example of the ability to enjoy a true 
present.

   But how can we do that when our experience is that our lives are 
falling apart?

   Our lives are really no different than they were prior to 9/11. What 
is different is that we see the reality of "what is" a bit better. 
True, these are difficult times. I'm inviting you to come to the 
Ordinary Life Gathering this Sunday. What I want to offer is comfort 
and suggestions on not just how to survive our present circumstances 
but how to thrive in the midst of the places that scare us.

   I look forward to seeing you then.

Much love,

Bill Kerley
