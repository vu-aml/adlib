MRS HELEN OTI,

22 NELSON MANDELA ROAD,

JONNESBOUGH,

SOUTH AFRICA.

DEAR BElOVED,

PRAISE GOD, THE MOST BENEVOLENT.
       

I am the above named person from South Africa. I am married to Late Johnson
Oti of blessed memory  who worked with Cyprus embassy in Nigeria for nine
years before he died in the year 2004.

We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness
that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both very devoted
Christian. Since his death I too have been battling with both cancer and
fibroid problems. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$7.5
Million (seven Million five hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with an oversea
security company. Presently, this money is still with the Security  Company
in Europe.

Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months
due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness.
Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a Christian
organization or devoted Christian individual that will utilize this money
the way I am going to instruct here- in. I want this Christian organization
or individual to use this money in all sincerity to fund churches, orphanages,
widows and also propagating the word of GOD and to ensure  that the society
upholds the views and beliefs of the holy Bible. The holy bible  emphasized
so much on GOD?S benevolence and this has encouraged me to take this bold
step. 

I took this decision because I don?t have any child that will  inherit this
money and my husband relatives are new Muslim converts and I don?t want my
husband?s hard earned money to be misused by people I call unbelievers. I
don?t want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy manner.
Hence the reasons for taking this bold decision. I know that after death
I will be with GOD the most beneficent and the most merciful. I don?t need
any telephone communication in this regard because of my health and because
of the presence of my husband?s relatives around me always. I don?t want
them to know about this development. 

With GOD all things are possible.  As soon as I receive your reply I shall
give you the contact of the Security Company. I will also issue you a letter
of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of this fund.
I want you and the Christian community where you reside to always pray for
me.

My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted Christian worthy of
emulation. Whoever that wants to serve the God must serve him in truth and
in fairness. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay
in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a Christian organization
or a devoted Christian for this same purpose. Until I hear from you, my dreams
will rest squarely on your shoulders .Get back to me via this email address:
halima_oti@sify.com

May the almighty God continue to guide and protect you.

Regards,

MRS HELEN OTI.
