Rick and Lynn,

Raetta and I heard from the mailroom early this afternoon that UPS was suspending service with Enron.  We discussed other options and decided to inquire with UPS or Fed Ex about opening an account thru NNG.

When I contacted UPS, I discovered that UPS is resuming service with Enron today.  The mailroom is aware of the situation.
