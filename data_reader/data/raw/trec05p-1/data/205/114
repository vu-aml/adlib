Subject: report from Keith


Forwarding Kieth's report from last weekend of doe season.

Had to call him to get information on what made his heart race.

He saw Mertz's rib cage buck at boneyard, other side of the fence, said it
was 14 inches wide with tines that were incredibly long almost touching at
the top. he said 140plus, no problem.

saw brian's deer's younger brother at lonestar and said it will be a great
bucknext year.

While spotlighting bunnys saw a buck at the protien feeder at launching pad
that was unbelivable. He said he counted 12 scorable points, not including
several kickers he did not count. the deer was wide with aobut 8 to 9 inch
tines. walked with a limp on front right leg. Must be a nocturnal old
warrior, never seen before.

other than that he saw a smattering of does and yong bucks. feeders still
running.  e.
