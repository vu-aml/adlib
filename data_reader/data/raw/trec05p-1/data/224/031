Dear Shelly:

Ernie approved the VBS curriculum today...I knew he would but since it was 
not
UMC I needed to have his approval. He got excited about it jus tlike we did. 
I also need to give him some of the "Kids Own Church" stuff to approve as 
well.  Do you have a few copies I could show him?  Ange Grout and Bobbie 
Oldfield are on tap for the third Sundays for Children's Church.  I will call 
the Ackermans tomorrow, did not wish to leave a message so I said I would 
call them tomorrow on the message machine.  I know the call will go well.  
Did you all decide on a date for the meeting for Children's Church leaders?  
I did not catch the date and time.  
Thanks so much,
Patty
