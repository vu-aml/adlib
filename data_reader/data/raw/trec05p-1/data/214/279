SWERZ, 
Congratulations go out to the New England Patriots and the St. Louis Rams for earning a trip Super Bowl XXXVI (36). It should be a good game despite what the odds makers are saying, which is St. Louis to win by 14 points. New England keeps surprising and I expect them to make it a closer game than people think. 

I'm writing to tell you about the Super Bowl Square Pools on OFP. Square pools are the 10x10 grid pools that you often see for the Super Bowl. I always run a square pool on OFP during our Super Bowl party. I set up the pool and then people who are OFP members can log in and enter their own picks (even if they aren't at the party) and for everyone else, I create an Alias for them and enter their picks that way. It's super easy and it makes for a fun time and an exciting game, even if your team isn't winning. 

You can start your Square Pool now and see how it works and get things set up. Then if you like the format and want to proceed with the pool, Square Pools cost only $6.95, less than 7 cents per square. Start your square pool now! <http://www.officefootballpool.com/jumpto.cfm?id=155>

I also wanted to tell you about our NCAA Basketball Tournament Pool site called www.tournamentpools.com. I've been working hard to get Tournament Pools up and running for the 2002 season. There's a slick new javascript picksheet and other great improvements. If you liked Tournament Pools last year, you'll love it this year. Look for my announcement next week saying that Tournament Pools is open. 

I hope you have a great Super Bowl and if you don't run a Square Pool I hope to see you for basketball at TournamentPools.com. 

Good luck!

John
