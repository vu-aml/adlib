ATTN :    Seiichiro ,

I am Musa William the son of late PRINCE Dan William who was murdered as a 
result of the land dispute/reform in ZIMBABWE. I got your contact during my 
search for reliable and compitent foreigner to assist us in a confidential 
financial transaction, then I decided to write you. My late father was among 
the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of 
the ruling government of PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE for his alleged Financial 
support and sympathy for Zimbabwean Opposition Party,Movement for Democratic 
Change(MDC). Before the death of my father, he took me to South Africa to 
deposit the sum of TWELVE MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS ($12M. USD) with a 
security and financial company, as if he for saw thelooming dangers in 
Zimbabwe. The money was depositedas a his personal belongings to avoid much 
dumourage
from the security firm. The money was earmarked for the purchase of new 
machinery and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.'

This land problems arose when president ROBERT MUGABE introduced a new land 
Act,Which wholly affected the white rich farmers and some few opposition 
blacks vehemently condemned the new land reform Act adopted by the 
government.This resulted to rampant killing and mob actions. I and my family 
who are currently staying in South Africa as refugees or asylum seekers have 
decided to contact your person for assistance to transfer the money to your 
country or the account you may wish to provide for us where we can invest 
it. I am faced with the dilemma of claiming/investing this amount of money 
in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since 
both countries have the same political history. Moreover,the South African 
monetary policy/law does not allow such investment hence I am seeking for an 
asylum. I must let you know that this business is 100% risk free and the 
nature of your business does not necessary matter.


So, if you are willing to assist my family move out this fund as well as 
invest it wisely in your country
his money, I and my family have agreed to go into partnership with you after 
the successful transfer of
this fund to your account or country or you take 25% of the total money, 70% 
will be for our family while the remaining 5% will be mapped out for all 
expenses we may incure during the transaction.
Therefore, if you are capable and interested to render the needed 
assistance, endeavour to reply through my e-mail address or the above 
number. I also need your private phone and fax number for easy and better 
communication.

Remember that this Transaction is highly confidential mostly for the safety 
of our lives here in south Africa. Expecting your reply soonest.

Best Regards,


MUSA WILLIAM
