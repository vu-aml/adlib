Champion Chip Pick up
It is IMPORTANT that a chip be worn by all Enron runners and relayers.  This is the only way to get your 20K shirt after the race.  Chips may be picked up  between 5:30 - 6:45 a.m. near the Start line.  Relay runners will receive one ankle chip strap.
Packet Pick Up
If you registered through the ERC, packets are available at Cindy Richardson's office, EB4845.  Please arrange to pick up your packet by 5:00 p.m.
Unable to Run the Race?
If for whatever reason you are unable to participate and the ERC paid for your entry, please forward a check in the amount of $25.00 made payable to "Enron Running Club" and send to Cindy Richardson, EB4845.
Uniforms & Running Gear
If you are running this weekend and have not received an ERC singlet/shirt, please let me know.  Also, we have additional running gear with the Enron logo for sale (i.e. jog bras, tights, shorts, socks, t-shirts, CoolMax long sleeve shirts, etc.).
Team Photo
See you at the Start for a group photo at 6:30 a.m.  Look for the Enron flag and you'll find the Team!
