Laura, let me visit with Darrell to see what would be the best date to schedule the hot tap. The 20th is the week of Thanksgiving, maybe the week after would be better. Like the 26th or 27th. I'll get back to you soon and let you.

WE need to do a 12" hot tap on the West Texas Loop line for the Agave
Interconnect.  This will be just north of the Atoka II junction.  I think we
can be ready for the hot tap by 11-20-01 based on when we should be
receiving materials.  The tap is to be in service by 12-1-01.  The pressure
at the time of the tap needs to be reduced to a maximum of 712 psig.  Is
there a good time to do the tap or a good time not to?  Attached is the
outage report.
