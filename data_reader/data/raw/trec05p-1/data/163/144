<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11px; COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: monospace, courier">Greetings,<BR>I can't imagine how you will feel receiving a sudden business letter from a country in far away Hong Kong and probably from some one you have not closely related with. But all the same, I believe we do not need to be of blood relatives before we can establish cordial/business relationship. Having said this, I think it is very important at this juncture to introduce myself to you and also disclose to you, how I came in contact with your email address/profile. My name is Mr PETER WONG I am the district (Foreign operations) manager of Standard chartered bank h.k ltd . I got your email address from the Internet. It is my pleasure to solicit your assistance in this business proposal. I am contacting you because I do not want to transact the business with anybody who is known to any staff of this bank or anybody around here to avoid any possible blackmail or leakage at the end of the transaction.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;THE PROPOSAL:-</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11px; COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: monospace, courier">There is an account in this bank, Standard chartered Bank h.k ltd, which was opened in 1982 by Mr.Morris Thompson,who was the formal president and chief executive officer of Doyon Ltd. and since 2000 nobody has operated on this account. I had a very careful study of the account files through which I carried an extensive investigation about the holder of the said account and Found out that Mr.Morris Thompson was involved in the Alaska plane crash of january 31,2000 along with his wife and daugther. you can see the website that tells more of his untimely death, <A href="http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/">http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/</A><BR>thereby abandoning the account, having been fictitious regards the information he submitted to this bank at the time of establishment of the account. The account at this moment has no inheritance since the name Mr.Morris Thompson filled in as his relations was his wife Thelma thompson,who unfortunately was involved in the plane crash.<BR>I have secretly removed all the relevant files to the account from the dormant section so that bank auditors will not verify the abandoned money and refer it to Federal Treasury. The Credit balance of the said account is US$25.5m.<BR>My Dear Friend, the deal here is that the money in this account will be approved and remitted to any foreigner who shows up as relation to Mr. Morris Thompson, provided such person has correct information to the account,I have such needed information and will hand it over to you as soon as we commence the transaction. I will source all necessary documents and forward them to you for direct submission to the bank.<BR>With my position as the foreign Operations manager we will quietly remove this money from the bank without hitches. I dont have any problem in regularizing all necessary documents and transferring the credit ballance of the said account to your nominated bank account <BR>in overseas, but the problem is trust. I have spent months in trying to get an overseas reliable contact. It is worthy to note that people are unreliable these days and even derive joy in telling lies.<BR>On this ground I request your unreserved but sincere cooperation devoid of greed in carrying out this transaction so that no one amongst both&nbsp; of us shall defraud each other at the end. I am prepared to split at 60%---40% for you, provided that mine (60%)will be intact at the end. Please get back to me soonest.<BR>Your soonest response is anticipated.<BR>Best regards,</SPAN></P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11px; COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: monospace, courier">
