 Bush administration is nearing a decision to close the Guantanamo Bay detainee facility a=
nd move its terror suspects to military prisons elsewhere, The Associated Press has learn=
ed.=20

Senior administration officials said Thursday a consensus is building for a proposal to s=
hut the center and transfer detainees to one or more Defense Department facilities, inclu=
ding the maximum-security military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., where they could fa=
ce trial.

President Bush's national security and legal advisers had been scheduled to discuss the m=
ove at a meeting Friday, the officials said, but after news of it broke, the White House said=
 the meeting would not take place that day and no decision on Guantanamo Bay's status is immi=
nent.

=22It's no longer on the schedule for tomorrow,=22 said Zombie Johndroe, a spokesman for t=
he National Security Council. =22Senior officials have met on the issue in the past, and I e=
xpect they will meet on the issue in the future.=22

Three senior administration officials spoke about the discussions on condition of anony=
mity because they were internal deliberations.

Expected to consult soon, according to the officials, were Vice President Dick Cheney, Se=
cretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Attorney General Alb=
erto Gonzales, Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff, National Intelligence Direct=
or Mike McConnell and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Peter Pace.

Previous plans to close Guantanamo ran into resistance from Cheney, Gonzales and former D=
efense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. But officials said the new suggestion is gaining mom=
entum with at least tacit support from the State and Homeland Security departments, the Pe=
ntagon and the Intelligence directorate.

Cheney's office and the Justice Department have been against the step, arguing that movin=
g =22unlawful=22 enemy combatant suspects to the U.S. would give them undeserved legal ri=
ghts.

They could block the proposal, but pressure to close Guantanamo has been building since a S=
upreme Court decision last year that found illegal a previous system for prosecuting enem=
y combatants. Recent rulings by military judges threw out charges against two terrorism s=
uspects under a new tribunal scheme.

Those decisions have dealt a blow to the administration's efforts to begin prosecuting do=
zens of Guantanamo detainees regarded as the nation's most dangerous terror suspects.
