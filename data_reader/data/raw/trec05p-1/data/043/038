TIPS & TRICKS

So Much To Do...
You don't need to tap the New button to create a new To Do 
item.  With nothing selected, start writing in the Graffiti(R) 
area. A new record will be created automatically.  This tip 
also works in Memo Pad and the other built-in apps on your 
handheld.  For other tips, check out Palm Organizers: Visual 
QuickStart Guide.

Full Apps Ahead:  
To load third-party applications faster, try this tip from
