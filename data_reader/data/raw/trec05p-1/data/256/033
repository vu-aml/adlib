Subject: *EMCA* Linoleum for sale

I have a 6 1/2' x 8 1/2' sheet of genuine Linoleum, just like they used to
use in the '30's and '50's in homes and office buildings.  It is a
buff/yellow color, with grey swirls.  It's brand new and left over from when
they did my new kitchen floor (they mis-measured and ordered too much).

Linoleum is a all-natural product, made with linseed oil and cork, and
that's about it.  It wears like iron, is easy on the feet, and has a cool
retro look.

I believe Linoleum installs just like conventional vinyl flooring.  The only
trick is if you have to seam two pieces together, in which case you need a
special "heat seal" tool, and lots of expertise.  But, if you have a small
bathroom or very small kitchen, this one sheet should do nicely.

I paid nearly $2,000 to have my small kitchen re-floored in this linoleum.
You can have this piece for a mere $75.
