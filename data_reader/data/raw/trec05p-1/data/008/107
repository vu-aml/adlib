HOUSE HEARING EXAMINES BENEFITS, RISKS OF EMPLOYER
INVESTMENT ADVICE

The potential benefits and risks of legislation that would
allow employers more leeway in providing investment advice
to employees participating in self-directed retirement
savings plans are debated in a hearing before the House
Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on
Employer-Employee Relations.

The risks inherent in enacting legislation (H.R. 2269) that
would allow employers to give employees access to investment
advice are outweighed by the need for increased access and
offset by safeguards to protect employees, says John Boehner
(R-Ohio), chairman of the House Education and the Workforce
Committee and sponsor of the Retirement Security Advice Act.

Ann Combs, assistant labor secretary for pension and welfare
benefits, calls providing increased access to investment
advice a critical issue and says the Labor Department
supports the proposed amendments to ERISA. Committee
Democrats argue for expansion of safeguards to protect
employees and prevent abuses, while the AFL-CIO says the
bill would expose employees to the risk of being steered
toward high-fee investment products and could exacerbate
Section 401(k) losses. . . . Page AA-1

COURT REJECTS TRUCK DRIVERS' SUIT  ALLEGING WAGE SKIMMING BY
EMPLOYER

A group of Illinois truck drivers failed to show that their
employer breached its collective bargaining contract with
their union by skimming funds from their wages, the Seventh
Circuit rules, affirming a lower court's series of judgments
for the employer ("McLeod v. Arrow Marine Transport, "7th
Cir.,  No. 01-1060,  7/12/01).

The drivers could not prevail on their hybrid breach of
contract and duty of fair representation claim under Section
301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act against Arrow
Marine Transport Inc. unless they first could establish that
their union was not representing them fairly, Judge Bauer
explains. Finding that the drivers did not show that the
Chauffeurs, Teamsters and Helpers Union Local No. 301
breached its duty of fair representation by failing to
uncover the alleged wage-skimming scheme, the court affirms
the trial court's decision to grant the company summary
judgment as to claims brought by three of the plaintiffs and
to dismiss the claims of five other drivers. . . . Page A-8

NINTH CIRCUIT REVIVES 'EFFEMINATE' RESTAURANT WORKER'S
HARASSMENT CLAIM

A restaurant employee who allegedly was sexually harassed
because he was too effeminate should be able to take his
claim to trial under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act,
the Ninth Circuit rules ("Nichols v. Azteca Restaurant
Enter. Inc., "9th Cir., No. 99-35579, 7/16/01). Reversing
summary judgment granted by the  U.S. District Court for the
Western District of Washington to Azteca Restaurant
Enterprises, the appeals court rules that Antonio Sanchez's
sexual harassment claims under Title VII and the Washington
Law Against Discrimination should survive because he was
singled out for harassment by male co-workers and a
supervisor who considered him feminine and believed he did
not meet their views of a male stereotype.

 Judges Gould and Reinhardt find that while Azteca did have
a sexual harassment policy in place and exercised reasonable
care to prevent sexual harassment, its response to Sanchez's
complaints was not sufficiently prompt to avoid liability.
Dissenting on the issue of vicarious liability, Judge
Wardlaw argues that Azteca's response was appropriate, and
Sanchez's failure to report further harassment to management
made him partly responsible for the company's inaction. . .

KMART VIOLATED ERISA IN USING WRONG INTEREST RATE, SAYS
COURT

Kmart Corp. violated the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act when it computed lump-sum pension plan distributions
using the wrong interest rate, the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of Illinois rules ("Tullock v. Kmart
Corp. Employee Pension Plan, "S.D. Ill., No. 99-CV-0289-DRH,
6/29/01). Judge Herndon finds that the retailer used the
incorrect "GATT rate" in computing the lump-sum
distributions by using the January 1997 rate of 6.83 percent
rather than the 1998 rate of 5.81 percent.

Kmart alleged that the January 1997 rate was the appropriate
one because, although the lump-sum distribution checks were
dated Feb. 1, 1998, the checks were sent out on Jan. 31,
1998.  Kmart cannot "alter the fact that the checks were
dated and thus distributed on February 1, 1998 by claiming
that it has discretion to determine what the word
'distribution' means," Herndon writes. . . . Page A-6

 WILHELM SAYS HERE NEEDS UNIFIED STANCE IN FACE OF HOTEL
CONSOLIDATIONS

As the hotel industry in North America continues to
consolidate under fewer and fewer major corporate owners,
the union that represents hotel workers must present a more
unified stance in negotiations, perhaps even coordinating
contracts so that individual locals can negotiate jointly
with the major hotel chains, John Wilhelm, president of the
Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees says.

HERE should set minimum goals for all contracts, make card
check neutrality a demand in all negotiations, and
coordinate campaigns against the major chains, the number of
which has dwindled steadily from about 18 as recently as
1995 to only eight today--with still more consolidation
likely in the next few years--Wilhelm tells union members
attending HERE's convention in Los Angeles.  To counter that
trend, HERE must "knit together" a unified union, while not
losing the vitality of its various locals, Wilhelm says in
his keynote address. . . . Page C-1

SMOKE-SENSITIVE EMPLOYEE  CAN PROCEED IN ADA RETALIATION
CLAIM

A smoke-sensitive employee who was discharged after she
failed to report to work in a newly smoke-free office
building can proceed with a retaliation claim under the
Americans with Disabilities Act, the Fourth Circuit holds
("Rhoads v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., "4th Cir., No.
98-2374, 7/12/01).

Reversing a district court in Baltimore, the appeals court
says Lori Rhoads, a former financial analyst at a failed
Maryland bank, had provided enough evidence that her
discharge--for excessive unexcused absenteeism--was illegal
retaliation under the ADA. The Fourth Circuit reinstates the
claim against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., in its
capacity as a receiver for Standard Federal Savings Bank and
its successor institution, Standard Federal Savings
Association.

 However, the court affirms summary judgment for the
employer on Rhoads's claim that the bank failed to
reasonably accommodate her disability under the ADA and on
her claim that the bank violated the Family and Medical
Leave Act. . . . Page A-1
