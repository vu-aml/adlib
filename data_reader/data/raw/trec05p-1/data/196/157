Sara,

I had mentioned that I thought West LB was missing a few trades, but everything now appears to be o.k.  I double checked the spreadsheet they sent, and the extra trades we have actually cancel one another out.  

What we now need from West LB is their settlement amount and valuation methodology.  

Thanks!
