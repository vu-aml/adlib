The Three Envelopes Of Success

  A giant corporation was struggling and hired a new
  CEO. The former CEO was kind enough to leave the
  new chief with three envelopes. "If and only if you
  run into problems and cant find a solution, use one
  on the three envelopes." The cocky young man
  thought nothing of it and threw the envelopes in
  his desk. About a year later the corporation began
  to lose profits and the new CEO had no clue how to
  turn it around. Seeking some kind of help, he
  remembered the envelopes. He noticed they were
  numbered 1 to 3 so he opened the first one.
  Inside it read "Blame it on your Predecessor". So
  he had a press conference and blamed the
  downfall on the former CEO. It dramatically turned
  around and profits boomed. Then about a quarter
  later they ran into some more trouble. Quick to
  find an answer, the young man opened the second
  envelope. It read "REORGANIZE". So he called yet
  another press conference and thought up a entire
  newly organized plan. Again everything was fine
  until about six months later when the bottom fell
  out again. The CEO didn't sweat it because he
  remembered he had another envelope. He hurried
  to the office and opened the last one. It said
  "PREPARE THREE ENVELOPES".
