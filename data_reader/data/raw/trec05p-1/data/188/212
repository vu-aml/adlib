Hey Eric:

Good to hear from you.  The holidays went very well.  I spent Christmas in
New Orleans with my family. I hadn't seen my parents and brother in a year,
so it was great. I have not found a job yet, but keeping my spirits up.

How were your holidays?  How is it going at Enron?  I understand the trading
group is close to being purchased.  Is that about right?

Please send the check to:

3000 Greendridge, Apt. 1818
Houston, TX  77057

Take care
Harry

Hey Harry,

How are things?  Have you found a job yet?  I trust the holidays went well
for you.

Anyways,  I have a check for $74 for FFL - where can I send it?

-Eric
