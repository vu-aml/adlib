Subject: Invitation to a web seminar on TCRs


ERCOT will be conducting a web seminar on the Transmission Congestion Right (TCR) program which will be implemented in conjunction with the direct assignments of congestion costs beginning February 15th, 2002. TCRs function as financial hedges against marginal costs associated with Zonal Congestion. TCRs are a financial right on a specified directional Commercially Significant Constraint (CSC) for a particular date and hour that entitles the TCR holder to receive remuneration from ERCOT for congestion costs. The TCR Program is open to any entity that qualifies as a TCR Account Holder, except for Transmission and Distribution Service Providers. Bidding on the first TCR auction is scheduled to start on January 30, 2002. The first auction for the TCR Program will be for 100% of the TCRs from February 15 - 28, 2002. The notice for the February auction will be posted on ERCOT's website by January 25, 2002. 
 
Training on TCRs was conducted at the ERCOT facilities in Austin during the week of January 7th. This web seminar was arranged to meet requests from participants to make the same material available to for those who were not able to come to Austin.  Please follow the instructions below to attend the web seminar at the specified date and time. There are a limited number of lines available for the conference call. Your cooperation in sharing one phone line with a speakerphone for multiple attendees from the same entity is greatly appreciated. 
 
The web seminar will begin with an introduction to TCRs and their use in the ERCOT market. The presentation will be followed by overview of the process to register and participate in the ERCOT TCR auction process, financial security requirements and settlement implications of TCRs. A follow up demonstration of the website and software that will be used to administer the auction is scheduled for Wednesday, January 23, 2002 from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. You will receive a separate e-mail notification on this web seminar.
