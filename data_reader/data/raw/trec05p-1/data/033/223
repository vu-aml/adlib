Michelle,

Welcome back from you vacation.  Attached is the contract between Enron and Indeliq, the attorney on this project is Ed Steakley out of Fulbright.  We need your comments on Indemnity to make sure that Enron is fine with it or if there is a need for changes.
Do you have the time to come back with review by Friday or do you want some one else to look at it? 
this is one of the outstanding issues that we need Enron Legal to review as soon as possible, but I understand you are trying to cutch up, so by Friday would work for me if it is ok with you.

Regards,

Yevgeny

It appears complex. I suggest finding someone at Enron who has no experience
with the deal and see if they can use the formulae. Point to the section,
but don't give them any background.

Give them the following:

22500  BBA Licenses Used
10100  Title 1 Used
550	 Title 2 Used
7000   Title 3 Used

Take a look at this draft,  tell me if this is simple enough.
