We are planning on a full remediation to the exposed A-line near Englewood Ks. this Friday October 26th.  Because this exposed line is in a flowing creek we are applying for a permit to the KDHE to permanately repair the area using a weir to maintain cover for the pipeline.  

The permit takes about 60 days to process but we have asked for a temporary repair because of the operational impact to our system.  The KDHE has agreed to allow the temporary repair until we have received our permit.  After the permit is received we will install our final weir using steel sheet piling and should not have any disruption to service when we do this. 

Sorry for the delay in getting the A-line back in full service but we wanted to ensure that we met all regulatory requirements and were prudent in our repair cost.  If all goes well we should be able to remove the operating restriction from the A-line this Friday.  If you have any questions please let me know.  later dn
