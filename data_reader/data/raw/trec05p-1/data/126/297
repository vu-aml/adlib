Michelle,
 
Thank you for your reply. I have been in training all day and will be there for half a day tomorrow. 
 
I did not list it on the compliance cert., because after reading the 62 page code of ethics, I felt the book was outside the parameters articulated in the book. After you came and talked to our class, I felt it was still outside the parameters but would be best to notify you so there would be no question later. (Yes, I did read the entire code of ethics!)
 
Hope you are doing well. Last week was a rough first week.
 
Best Regards, 
Bill

Bill,
 
Thanks for your note.  I have forwarded it to our compliance officer, who usually handles these types of issues.  
 
Did you disclose this on your certificate of compliance?  If not, that is ok, because you haven't written the book yet -- I was just asking.
 
I expect to hear back from our compliance officer shortly.  She usually is quite prompt.
 
Michelle

Hello, Michelle!
 
You came and spoke to my new hire class last Monday. I have a pending book deal with Zondervan publishing and wanted to make sure that there was no problem re the confidentiality agreement. 
 
I am certain there will be no problem. I have been a minister for 22 years and have a proposal being pitched by the senior editor at Zondervan to their editorial review board. The book will draw on my leadership/team-building experiences in the church and will be written from the perspective of a minister / mba. It will have nothing to do with Enron.
 
Please let me know when would be a good time to come by.
 
All The Best,
Bill
