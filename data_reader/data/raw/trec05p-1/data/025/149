#45 RICHARD AVE.
INDEPENDENCE LAYOUT,
Jorg.South Africa.

Dear Friend,

I m FRANCIS GODDAY, A Liberian, personal Assistant to A Minister who
mysteriously disappeared but now confirmed killed. I have personally
discovered some huge amount of money, totaling 36mUSD, which I want to
remove away from my Country.
The money is in the bank account opened here in South Africa by the
late
Minister for an Iranian oil merchant, who died a year before the
Minister
was adopted and murdered. This was for the purpose of running of oil
business in South Africa.
As the personal assistant to the Minister and also kindred, I was
directly
involved in the opening of the account. The Minister opened the account
with a foreign name and the account was without heir or next of kin for
security reasons. The local bank here can only release the fund to a
foreigner with correct documents and information, which I will provide
all
to you.
The late minister was dubious. I must confess. He made his money from
mismanagement of Government fund, kickbacks and over invoicing of
contract
sums awarded in Liberia during his tenure. I have all the correct
Information. Cooperation, confidentiality and abiding with instructions
are what are needed from you. You are not necessary required to travel
to
South Africa.
I need your assistance, which must include providing safe bank account
information in your country to lodge the fund and also your assistance
on
acquisition of residential building in your country and investing into
profitable ventures.
More so investing some percentage into any Foundation that caters for
upbringing of less privileged children all over the world.
At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 25% of the total
amount, 5% to Foundation that caters for upbringing of less privileged
children, 65%will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties
might have incurred during the process of transferring.
I m right now I am in South Africa. But the people here and the system
of
financial institutions in place is the scum of the earth. I need decent
person of transparent contents of character, to transact with.
Contact me immediate through my e-mail address for more
details...
Best Regards,
FRANCIS GODDAY.
