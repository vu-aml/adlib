Dear Sir,

I am Vladimir Balakov and I represent Mr. Mikhail
Khordokovsky the former C.E.O of Yukos Oil Company in
Russia. I have a very sensitive and confidential brief from
this top (oligarch) to ask for your partnership in
re-profiling funds over US$45 million. I will give the
details, but in summary, the funds are coming via Capital
 Bank . This is a legitimate transaction. You will be paid
4% for your "management fees".

If you are interested, please write back by email
vbalakov@mail2world.com and provide me with your
confidential telephone number, fax number and email address
and I will provide further details and instructions. Please
keep this confidential; we can't afford more
political problems. Finally, please note that this must be
concluded within two weeks. Please write back promptly.I
will also suggest you visit these news sites on the
internet to be better informed about this project.
