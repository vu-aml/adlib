...more than a third of workers plan to leave their current job within the next two years, despite the many layoffs in 2001. That lack of loyalty is almost unchanged from the economic boom days of 1999.(according to an article in the Houston Chronicle on Tuesday, September 4, 2001). 

There is a principle that endurance athletes must adhere to if they are ever to finish a long distance event - drink before you are thirsty. I think you will agree this principle applies to many areas of life and business. If we wait until the symptoms are easily observable, whether it is lack of employee retention or thirst, we have waited too late. 

We can be reasonably certain that the one-third who are considering a future elsewhere are not advertising their thoughts, which makes it even harder for leaders to recognize the symptoms. You can be sure of this though - the undercurrent of their attitude affects the whole organization!

Developing loyalty among employees is the same as satisfying a body's need for fluid - do it now if you are in it for the long term.  Here are some things to think about if you want to increase loyalty:

        Given a lack of inspired mission, employees will remain in it for themselves.

        Relationships deepen loyalty.

        When leaders relate - employees give extra credit. Visiting them in their workplace, talking about family concerns, acknowledgement of tough times,  and a sense of humor all make employees feel like the leader is relating to them.

        Take it personally. One act of concern lasts a lifetime.

        Make employee loyalty a metric you measure yourself by. The higher up a person is in the organization the more this becomes a necessity.
