URGENT ASSISTANCE REQUIRED.
Calvary greetings in the name of God, I am Mr. MUSA KABILA NASSER, I 
am 45years old; a native of Dubai.
My late father was killed by his business associate in 2003, and 
during the period i married we had a son which both of them was also 
killed in a cold blood a year later, I am now afraid of showing myself 
out to them (Business Associate Including members of my Family) as all 
are wanting to deny or kill me too, All because after the death of my 
father, I inherited all his business and wealth.

Currently, I am suffering from long time cancer of the brain. From all 
indications, my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious 
that I may not live more than six months, because the cancer stage has 
gotten to a very Severe stage.

Infact, my personal physician told me that I may not live for more 
than six months and I am so scared about this. So, I now decided to 
divide part of this wealth, by contributing to the well being of less 
privileged people and handicapped in the society of Asian, which is in 
my place, America Europe and African Countries.

This mission, which will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently 
relocate from my family house to new place where I live presently due 
to the pressure my family members are giving me as they want to share 
the fund within themselves which I don't want.
I selected you for this Purpose and prayed over it, I am willing to 
donate the sum of $11,300,000.00 Million US Dollars to you for the 
development of the well being of handicapped in the society and also 
as aids for the less privileged around your country, and I have mapped 
out $1,300,000.00 for your own personal use to help me for this work.
Please note that, this fund is currently lying in a Security Company 
in Europe and, therefore my ATTORNEY will file an immediate 
application for the transfer of the money in your name or your home. 
Please, do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund 
for personal use, than enhancement of the comfort of the Handicapped.

Lastly, I want you/your home to be praying for me as regards my entire 
life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual 
rebirth lately that wealth acquisition without God in one's life is 
vanity upon vanity.

I await your urgent reply.

Musa Kabila Nasser.
