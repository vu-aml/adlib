Louise,

Three questions/issues which I'd appreciate your feedback on:

1) I am planning to arrange for a meeting with gas and power originators/traders tomorrow to let them know what we are planning with the top 50 customers (sending draft PA's) and enlist their support for calls where we can leverage their relationships with the customers.

2) After some more thought, I'm on the fence about sending out the PA's without names. The following occurs to me:
	- Sending them out on Tuesday is only three days before we know what the final name will be
	- Sending them out with the final name probably helps our credibility
	- The PA/ETA is a very simple form; customers probably don't require the extra three days to review them.
	- Following the public release of our new Buyers' identity with the first release of the PA helps build a bit more excitement than otherwise.

3) I understand you are objecting to the provision which would allow us to release a customers' name to another company. I don't think most customers would object to this and getting the provisions in up front gives us more flexibility later. Can we keep this in?

Thanks,

Dave
