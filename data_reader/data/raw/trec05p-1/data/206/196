To those of us who have children in our lives, 
whether they are our own, grandchildren, nieces and nephews,
or students ... here is something to  make you chuckle. 

Whenever your children are out of control, you can take 
comfort from the thought that even God's omnipotence did not 
extend to His own children. After creating heaven and earth, 
God created Adam and Eve. 
And the first  thing he said was, "Don't." 
"Don't what ?" Adam replied. 
"Don't eat the forbidden fruit." God said. 
"Forbidden fruit? We have forbidden fruit? 
Hey, Eve ... we have forbidden fruit !" 
"No way !" 
"Yes, way !" 
"Do NOT eat the fruit !" said God. 
"Why ?" 
"Because I am your Father and I said so !" God replied, (wondering why 
he hadn't stopped creation after making the elephants). 
A few minutes later, God saw His children having an apple break and was 
He ticked! 
"Didn't I tell you not to eat the fruit ?" 
God, as our first parent, asked. 
"Uh huh," Adam replied. 
"Then why did you?" said the Father. 
"I don't know," said Eve. 
"She started it !" Adam said, 
"Did not !" 
"Did too !" 
"DID NOT !" 
Having had it with the two of them, God's punishment was that Adam and 
Eve should have children of their own. Thus, the pattern was set and it has 
never changed! 
But there is reassurance in this story. If you have persistently and 
lovingly tried to give children wisdom and they haven't taken it, don't 
be hard on yourself. If God had trouble raising children, what makes you 
think it would be a piece of cake for you? 

Advice for the day: 
If you have a lot of tension and you get a headache, do what it says on 
the aspirin bottle: "Take two Aspirin" and "Keep away from children." 

A FEW ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS ! ... 
CHILDREN: You spend the first 2 years of their life teaching 
them to  walk and talk. Then you spend the next 16 telling 
them to sit down and  shut-up. 

-Grandchildren are God's reward for not killing your children. 
-Mothers of teens know why some animals eat their young. 
-Children seldom misquote you. In fact, they usually repeat word for word 
what you shouldn't have said. 
-The main purpose of holding children's parties is to remind yourself 
that there are children more awful than your own. 
-We child proofed our home 3 years ago and they're still getting in!
