TORONTO, Nov. 26, 2001(Business Wire/press release) -- Hollinger Canadian
Newspapers, L.P. (TSE:HCN.UN.) announces net income including special
items for the quarter ending September 30, 2001 of $51,415,000 or
$0.28 per unit compared to $22,567,000 or $0.14 per unit for the
quarter ended September 30, 2000. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the nine months ended September 30, 2001 the net income was
$167,603,000 or $0.92 per unit compared to $75,550,000 or $0.47 per
unit for the nine months ended September 30, 2000.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income before special items and income taxes in both the third
quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2001 was significantly
lower than in 2000, primarily as a result of the disposition of
properties to CanWest Global Communications Corp. ("CanWest") in
November 2000, the sale of UniMedia Company in January 2001, the sale
of the majority of the Ontario properties in July 2001 as well as
lower operating results at the Partnership's remaining operations,
offset in part, by lower interest expense as a result of the
conversion of the acquisition notes to units in November of 2000 and
interest income primarily related to the CanWest debentures received
in November of 2000.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first nine months of 2001 special items totalled
$117,777,000 and included gains arising mainly from the sale of
UniMedia Company in January 2001 and the sale of the majority of the
remaining Ontario community newspapers in July 2001. In the first nine
months of 2000, special items totalled a loss of $1,672,000 and
principally represented severance charges. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Same Store Analysis<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a same store basis, including only those newspapers which were
owned for the nine-month period in each year, total revenue was
$77,421,000 in 2001 compared to $81,982,000 in 2000, a decrease of
$4,561,000 or 5.6%. EBITDA for 2001 was $8,581,000 compared to
$10,756,000 for 2000, a decrease of $2,175,000 or 20.2%.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment and Other Income<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the nine months ending September 30, 2001, investment and
other income includes a cash dividend of $1,225,000 on 8,164,000
CanWest non-voting shares, interest on cash balances of approximately
$3,300,000, interest income of $23,958,000 accrued on the subordinated
debentures the Partnership received as partial consideration from the
sale of newspapers to CanWest in November 2000 and other interest
income of $2,272,000. This debenture interest is payable at the option
of CanWest either in cash, by the issue of additional debentures or by
the issue of CanWest shares. The total principal amount of debentures
(as adjusted, if required) is due on November 15, 2010. The principal
amount of these debentures was $239,861,000 as at December 31, 2000.
On February 28, 2001 and July 31, 2001, a CanWest subsidiary issued
additional debentures with a total principal amount of $20,983,000 to
the Partnership. These debentures represent the arrears interest owing
from November 16, 2000 to July 31, 2001 calculated at 12.125% per
annum, of which $17,473,000 relates to the current year. As a result,
the principal amount of all CanWest debentures held at September 30,
2001 is $260,844,000.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial Condition and Liquidity<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working capital consists of current assets less current
liabilities. At September 30, 2001, working capital was $28,398,000
compared to $43,473,000 at December 31, 2000. The $15,075,000
reduction in working capital results from lower cash balances on hand
at September 30, 2001 primarily due to cash distributions in excess of
cash inflows during the period.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-term debt, including the current portion was $100,000 at
September 30, 2001 compared with $1,237,000 at December 31, 2000.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flows provided by operating activities were $22,783,000 in
the nine months ended September 30, 2001 compared with cash flows
provided by operating activities of $98,981,000 in 2000. The reduction
in cash flows provided by operating activities compared to 2000
results primarily from the sales of the Unimedia and Ontario newspaper
properties and lower operating results at the Partnership's remaining
operations.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flows used in financing activities were $375,062,000 for the
nine months ended September 2001 as compared to $107,953,000 for 2000.
The cash flows used in financing activities included cash
distributions of $374,968,000 in 2001 as compared to $107,424,000 in
2000.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flows provided by investing activities were $340,143,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2001 as compared to cash flow used
in investing activities of $7,963,000 in 2000. The increase in cash
flows provided by investing activities results primarily from the
proceeds on sale of the Unimedia and Ontario papers in January and
July of 2001. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distributions<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year, the Partnership has paid two special
distributions of $0.70 in March of 2001 and $1.18 in August of 2001
using the proceeds from the sale of properties during the year.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2001, the Partnership, Hollinger International Inc.
and Hollinger Inc. announced that the Partnership had constituted a
committee of independent directors to explore with Hollinger the
possibility of an offer to purchase the units of the Partnership not
held by Hollinger, being approximately 24 million units. The structure
and terms of any such offer (including the form of consideration to be
offered) have not been proposed and there can be no assurance that any
offer will be made.<BR>
