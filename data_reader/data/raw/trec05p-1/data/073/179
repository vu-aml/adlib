Kim:  Sounds like you're confused.  ENA is requiring two opinions:  one from Glendale (inhouse) and another which we are paying for (Glendale's outside counsel)  Call me.  Please do not forward my messages to Glendale because we are now at cross purposes.  There is no need to alarm Glendale about our existing arrangements.  Sara

our attorney, Sara Shackleton?

Thanks,
