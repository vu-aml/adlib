Elizabeth, 
May I put your name in my resume as a reference person?  You know my intentions:  to do everything possible to keep working for newco,  but, I have told you that I am also getting myself out there into the very limited Portland energy network "just in case."   I promise you I will always keep you advised very specifically of what I am doing.  ----cgy
