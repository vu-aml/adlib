Alex is dead cool. Bobby, Kent and I are really bummed he moved to NYC. Glad 
you met him, and Roger, who is one of my best friends. I hope you and 
Prentice told him about Rockygrass.

We will have four cars if I get this used Volvo. But then we'll donate the 
SAAB and take the tax write-off, and Cameron can use my Jeep in the Valley 
to commute, where it will survive better, not getting rained on all the 
time. And I'll finally have a car in which to go surfing, drive up to the 
Dome, and go out in the Mission without getting egged. It is a 2001 S60 that 
some golf pro bought and then six months later he got a hole in one, won a 
sweeter car, and so sold it back to the dealership. It has 8000 miles and 
costs about the same as a Jetta, which is sort of a steal. Again, I'll have 
to finance it up the ying-yang, but that's cool, mostly because those cars 
last forever and I can't begin to afford a new one. Anyway, I really don't 
want another Yuppie mobile, so just thought I'd seek your advise on this 
very sensitive matter.

I'm down here through the weekend, and then I'll finally be back in SF. It's 
good writing down here, though, what with the Mediteranean vibe and all.

Hope all's well,

Scott
