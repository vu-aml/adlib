Cara,

Data is cleared and should be ready to go.

Is there anything else you are waiting on?

Thanks,

Good Morning Fellas,

In anticipation of the next testing opportunity,  I am going to use June 20th as my target date.  Can you please clear out the routes for that date at all West Points, I am going to evaluate more complicated routing and pathing next.

I will wait to test until given the go-ahead by you.

C
