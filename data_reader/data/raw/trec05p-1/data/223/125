The Oi| and Gas Advisory

Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bull market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oil Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi|lions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

April 29- Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc., today is pleased to announce that 
the Company has advanced the final payment of drilling funds to the 
operator for the Acadia Project, a multi-objective oil and gas exploration 
play.

The Acadia Project consists of 15 sections in Alberta in an area that 
produces natural gas from the Viking formation, has oil potential in the 
Bakken zone and gas potential in the Colony and Second White Specks 
zones. The Viking contains natural gas in wells around the Acadia project 
and has the potential for 13 Bcf gas in the reservoir under the leases. 

Gas wells in the area have calculated AOF rates up to 14 Mmcf per day. 
The Project is located in eastern Alberta with year round access and an 
established production and equipment infrastructure. Well costs are 
expected to be $600,000 drilled, cased and completed and the advanced 
funds will go towards the drilling of the first well. Each well drilled by 
Emerson on the licenses earns a 49% Working Interest in 4 sections. 
Each well on a lease earns Emerson a 49% Working Interest in one section.

April 22- Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to explore 
the development of drilling programs in Wyoming (USA), as well as Alberta 
(CANADA), where several more very intriguing prospects, that include 
existing production, are developing rapidly. Emerson will announce 
further details as lease opportunities and contract negotiations come to 
fruition.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for drilling 
programs involves existing production of oil and or gas opportunities, as 
well as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very 
optimistic that with its current deal flow it will be able to build a solid 
foundation to grow.

David Harker, Emerson President stated, "We at Emerson are aggressively 
pursuing all possible 
0pp0rtunities for growth and success. We believe that in many 
situations we will have the 
0pp0rtunity to include existing production in a drilling program, which 
will always encourage the participation of financial partners."

The value of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu|| 
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves worth mu|ti-millions, EOGI is selling for |ess than 1/4 the 
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn 
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. A|ready 
shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the overa|l market. 
In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors for the 
past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized explorers and 
deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are being made. In 
the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and even quadruple 
returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particular|y close attention to underva|ued 
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l company 
with a comparably smal| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oi| 
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia|ly with 
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But all that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move 
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to 
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally exp|osive effect on 
the share price.

What wi|l the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson 
Oil and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about 
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases in 
the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or decline
slightly, you wi|l stil| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy 
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year 
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wil| soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be 
staggering.

Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy 
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized, 
EOGI shares wi|| surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have 
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are we|| established and are going into massive 
production. Early investors will secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this area will really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our 
targets upward in next week's bu|letin.
