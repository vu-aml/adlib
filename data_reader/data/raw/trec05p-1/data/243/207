We've been talking on our Computer & Video Games Discussion Board <http://forums.prosperotechnologies.com/n/mb/listsf.asp?webtag=am-compgames> about the most overlooked game of 2001. The ground rule for judging is simple: the title has to have missed out on its fair share of attention or critical praise (games like Pikmin <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005Q8LY/ref=mk_del_267765_21>, Golden Sun <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005OARM/ref=mk_del_267765_22>, and Super Smash Bros. Melee <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005Q8M0/ref=mk_del_267765_23> don't meet this criteria for obvious reasons). Two games for Nintendo systems kept popping up in our discussion: Paper Mario <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004U1R3/ref=mk_del_267765_24>, which was released last spring for the retiring Nintendo 64, and Super Monkey Ball <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005QDQ1/ref=mk_del_267765_25>, which came out for the GameCube late last December. One could say that both games suffered from poor timing. What do you think of these two games, or, better yet, what do you think is the most overlooked game of 2001?
