Aaron,



Since late last week PG&E web site started to posted with non data for some of the points.  Our solution currently is refering to previous day's data on the same point and using same values for days overlap and giving same value for new day.  Example:  on 11/01/01's captured file on California Production Injection poin twe have --


			11/03/01	11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01
California Pro Injection	     172		      172		       172	       172   	      172


and on 11/02/01's captured file on California Production Injection point we have --

			11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01	11/08/01
California Pro Injection	     


when this happens, out transform code will fail and also potentially cause future loading jobs to fail because some future data is based on past data so we have to manually edited the file as follwing --

			11/03/01	11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01
California Pro Injection	     172		      172		       172	       172   	      172





Until web site data is back to normal or we find better solution, this will be the solution we implement for now.  Please let me or Chris Hyde know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
