Steve is good.  It's his shoulder that  he has problems with.  I saw Cara
at the OATI 1.7 training class in Las Vegas.  She wanted to know who was
doing our scheduling.  I told her you were for now.  Do you guys still
talk.  She said Stacy had left also.

treating you good or else?  I miss working with you guys.  we need to be
sure we keep in touch.  How's Steve?  I heard he was having problems with
