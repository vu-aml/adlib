Rice University realizes that these are difficult times for those alumni who
are employed at Enron.  We therefore invite you to attend a meeting on
Friday, December 7th at 3:00 p.m. in the Grand Hall of the Rice Memorial
Center to discuss how we might be of assistance.  We have email addresses
for many but not all of you, so please pass the word to your fellow Owls.
We have also created a website on which we will post information about
available services - http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~opa/enronowls.  Take care.
