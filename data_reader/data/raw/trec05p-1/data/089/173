SUMMARY.  Thailand Committee will meet at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday, October
25, in the Council's Conference Room, 1101 17th St., NW, Suite 411,
Washington, DC to begin the planning for the November 30 visit of Prime
Minister Thaksin Shinawatra to Washington.  PM Thaksin will be in
Washington for official visits, including one with President Bush, on
November 30, and Washington will be his only US stop.

The Council will be the lead on hosting the dinner for the Prime
Minister the evening of November 30 and we will submit suggestions for
the private sector section of the US Thailand Economic Framework which
should be signed during the visit.
========================================================================
===========================

I.  Agenda for Thursday, October 25 meeting at 3:00 PM in Council's
Washington conference room

	A.  Bill Ichord and Ernie Bower debrief on their Friday, October
19 meeting with Thai Foreign
	Minister Surakiart in Shanghai during which they discussed the
PM's trip at length
	B.  Discussion of PM Thaksin schedule in Washington on Nov. 30
and the US and Thai objectives
	for the visit
	C.  Discussion of the Council dinner and opportunities for
interaction with the Thai delegation
	and sponsorship (see #2 below)
	D.  Development of Private Sector input for the US Thailand
Economic Framework which should
	be signed as part of the visit  (see # 3 below)

2.  We are planning a major dinner for PM Thaksin and his delegation to
be proceeded by a pre-dinner CEO meeting on Friday evening, November 30,
2001.
Please let me know if you are interested in a host sponsorship for the
dinner at $10,000.  

3.  We will be asked to develop the Private Sector element of the US
Thailand Economic Framework which will definitely follow the lines of
much of what we pursued during our just-completed Mission to Thailand,
October 9-10.  In addition, we will be gathering infomation on any deals
and/or training/community support programs that could be signed or
announced during the visit.  We hope to develop a better snapshot of
current US investment in Thailand, investment $'s, number of employees,
education/training/human resource development, etc.  We found during our
recent visit that no one, the US Embassy, AmCham, seems to have this
information.  Thoughts about how best to do this will be appreciated.

Please let me know if you have any questions and please respond on the
form below if you would like to attend the 10/25 meeting.  Thank you.

____    YES, I WILL ATTEND THE 10/25 MEETING AT THE COUNCIL AT 3:00 PM.
(1101 17TH ST., NW, SUITE 411, DC).
