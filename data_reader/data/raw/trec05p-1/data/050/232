Route 66: Legal Kicks and Conflicts
Texas Lawyer
It started with a talk show comment about beef, but it turned into
one of the biggest legal beefs in Route 66 country -- a circus
atmosphere prevailed when Oprah Winfrey came to trial under the
so-called "veggie libel law." This week Texas Lawyer's Route 66
series continues with the Oprah trial in Amarillo, as well as a
look back at a high-profile murder trial that was moved to Potter
County. Harris County DA Chuck Rosenthal recounts the prosecution's
underdog victory.

OTHER - ELECTION LAW
Perry v. Del Rio
Dominant jurisdiction cannot be conferred on a court by the filing
of a claim, either by an original or amended pleading, unless the
claim was ripe when the filing was made; a claim's lack of ripeness
when filed is not a jurisdictional infirmity requiring dismissal if
the case has matured. Supreme Court of Texas, No. 01-0728; Posted

required by Rule 34.6(f)(3). Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, No.
1193-00; Posted September 12, 2001.

CRIMINAL - TEXAS PENAL CODE §12.42(C)(2)
Scott v. State
When a statute explicitly restricts the collateral consequences of
an offense, the defendant is entitled to rely on that restriction;
punishment for the offense is increased by the removal of the
statutory restriction, and such an increase in punishment
constitutes an ex post facto law. Texas Court of Criminal Appeals,
No. 1220-00; Posted September 12, 2001.

INSURANCE - TEXAS INSURANCE CODE ARTICLE 21.21-8
Cortez v. Progressive County Mutual Insurance Co.
The plain language of article 21.21-8 provides a definition of
unfair discrimination; looking exclusively to article 21.21-6 to
define such term would ignore the plain language of article
21.21-8. Austin Court of Appeals, No. 03-99-00846-CV; Posted

CRIMINAL - DWI
Castillo v. State
Absent a jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant had
been convicted of an intoxication offense committed within 10 years

offense. Austin Court of Appeals, No. 03-00-00185-CR; Posted
