RE: PERMIAN BASIN 3rd QUARTER PRODUCTION 2001REPORT

Lippman Consulting, Inc. has just completed the Permian Basin Production 
report that contains historical volumes for the basin through the 3rd quarter 
of 2001.  The report separates the Permian Basin into the following four 
regions: Southeast New Mexico and the Texas districts of 7C, 8 and 8A.  The 
report contains text and graphs depicting various historical statistics for 
each of the four regions as well as for the total basin.  Statistics on the 
number of new wells first delivered, rig activity and the operators that are 
most active in the region are included in the study.  

The cost for the report is $300 on a quarterly subscription basis or the 
report can be purchased on a one time basis for $450.  If you would like 
additional information or to order the report, please feel free to contact me 
by e-mail at Lippmanc@AOL.com or phone at 915-581-1668.
