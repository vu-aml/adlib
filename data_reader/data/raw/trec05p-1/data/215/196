Dear World Investor Link User:

Recently we contacted you about casting your vote for the 7th Annual
Investor Relations Magazine U.S. Awards, held in association with
Barron's.

We want to know what sophisticated individual investors think about
the current financial market environment.  Important developments have
taken place to make the marketplace more individual-investor friendly.
 U.S. corporations, now recognizing the importance of individual
investors, have made information that was formerly available only to
the "professional institutional investor," available to you.

But some corporations do a better job in making their corporate
information accessible and useable for the individual investor.  We
want to know which U.S. corporations, in your opinion, are the best at
communicating with the individual investor.  The companies that
receive the most votes will be recognized at the Investor Relations
U.S. 2002 Awards.

If you've already responded, we'd like to thank you for your help with
this important project.  If you haven't had a chance, we'd like you to
please take a few minutes to participate in this survey.  Just click
on the following URL, or copy and paste the URL into your web browser
to participate:

http://betasurvey.com/b/barrons/relations/ix.asp?PIN=WX4NB

Your personal password (PIN): WX4NB

Your votes will make U.S. companies understand the information and
data you need from them to make informed investment decisions.  Please
be assured that your identity will be kept completely confidential. 
The results will only be used in combination with other World Investor
Link users to determine the Investor Relations U.S. 2002 Awards winners.

If this isn't a convenient time for you to participate, you can
participate any time before February 6th by using the above URL and
password.

Thanks you for your time and cooperation in this project.

Sincerely,

Nancy S. Christman
Vice President, Marketing
World Investor Link
