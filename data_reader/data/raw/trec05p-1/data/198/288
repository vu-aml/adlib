Hi Eric 

I told your Mom we would decide on my visit after all the wedding festivities are overwith.  I'm sorry I can't make it to the wedding but I have a few loose ends to clear up since my last day of work here is January 31.  I'll spend time with all of you when I visit.  I'm looking forward to it. 

The weather here is cold and blustery.  We had 14" of snow on January 6 but most of that is gone now.  We are to get snow showers over night but they only predict around an inch for the morning. 

Hi to Shanna and keep in touch. 

Love  Aunt Bonnie

Hi Aunt Bonnie,
 
It is great to hear from you.  We really missed the fact that your trip was delayed because of 9/11.  Things will be pretty hectic this weekend with Jason's bachelor party and my birthday.  We are going to dinner tomorrow night for my birthday to a restaurant that I have never tried. It should be good.
 
On Saturday, we will be celebrating Jason's bachelor party.  We are going on a casino cruise out of Galveston.  I am looking forward to it.  
 
When do you think that you are going to make it down for a visit?  How is the weather treating you up there?
 
It was nice to hear from you.
 
Love,

Eric
