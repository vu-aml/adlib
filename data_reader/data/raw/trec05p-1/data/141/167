no - parents were going to come to houston but changed their minds last weekend due to car issues and my mom's intuition.  Anyway, thought about going there but have decided to go to Dallas until friday and then come back to houston.  My life is in such a spiral right now, I hate to be around my parents when things aren't as they should be.  They have enough to worry about and don't need to worry about me!
 
Pocatello sounds fun as does Sun Valley - you will have a blast!  Have an awesome Thanksgiving - and don't forget to give Thanks!  Although times are tough - they could be worse!
