I just talked to Allison and Strawnie is out of ICU and in his own room. 
 He is still heavily sedated, but doing much better.  They are doing 
surgery on his arm and hand (left) tomorrow to close it up.  He will have 
to have more surgery when he gets home.  They are hoping to come home 
Monday evening if all continues to go well.  I asked her about phone calls 
to Strawnie and she said as soon as he is able to talk on the phone, he 
will call me.  So I will let you all know as soon as I hear from him.
Sally

Just wanted to give you all Strawnie's hotel address in case you wanted to 
send a card or something.  He is still in ICU at this point, so he cannot 
have flowers or plants in his room.   If flowers or plants are sent, they 
will keep them at the nurses' station until he goes into his own room.   He 
can receive balloons though.

Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center
1719 E. 19th Ave.
Denver, CO  80218

He is in ICU, Pod D

The hospital phone number is 303/839-6891.
