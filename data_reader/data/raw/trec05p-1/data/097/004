Have you ever had the urge to just take off at the last minute? If you
call the airlines, they want you to refinance your home for the cost of

you can't return on Sunday? Have you ever had a family emergency and the
airlines want $2,000 for you to fly? If these kinds of offers have just
turned you off, let us turn you back on to our new Bestfares.com
Last-Minute Weekend Deals. Now you can plan up to two weeks in advance or
leave in only three hours. You can depart on any Thursday, Friday or
Saturday and return on the following Sunday, Monday or Tuesday. Savings
can be up to 70 percent off. Check out our new section and you can book
these goodies online. For example, this week from Dallas there are 335

Angeles, 276 deals; from New York City, 327 deals; from San Diego, 258
