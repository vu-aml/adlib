So here's how it works.  The attached spreadsheet has three MASTER worksheets:

(i)  Energy  Operations 
(ii) IT
(iii) Support Services

All the rest of the worksheets are back up documentation for the rankings.

Please identify the people on the Masters who actually have contracts.

Thanks
