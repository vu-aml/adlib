Have all of the customers accepted for sure? What about someone from Texaco or Calpine? If we have extras how about Audrey, Tracy and Jan? Another person from Amoco(Penny?). Dynegy?

We are scheduled to attend Cirque Du Soleil's Dralion next Thursday, the 24th, at 5:00.  I'll pick up the tickets and meet everyone at the Will Call office.  There is no late seating.  The show lasts approximately 2 1/2 hours and then we will head over to Farrago's.  Farrago is at 318 Gray,  at the corner of Bagby.  We have 25 tickets and below is a list of attendees.
