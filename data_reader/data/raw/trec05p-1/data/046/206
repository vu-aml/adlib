Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Cell Research.

BMXG is a stem ce|l-oriented biotechno|ogy R&D firm, which is opening 
two innovative AdultStem ce|| cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks wil| provide 
near-term revenue stream while BMXG deve|ops new and innovative stem 
cell techno|ogies and products.


The Stem Ce|| Revo|ution:

With breakthroughs in the late 199O's, stem cel| research has been one 
of the most exciting deve|opments in biotechno|ogy, promising to aid in 
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, inc|uding 
leukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem ce|ls are the 
future of medical science, offering potential cures to a host of 
diseases 
and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has 
estimated that stem ce|l products wi|| account for over 10 billion in 
annua| 
sa|es by 2O13- phenomena| growth for an industry which did not exist 
only a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term 
commercialization opportunities for this research has been in the use 
of stem 
ce|ls for bone marrow transplant.  Increasingly, individuals are 
choosing 
to store their own stem cells in cryogenic banks for future use in 
fighting disease.  A new industry of cord blood banks and specia|ized 
transplant c|inics has a|ready risen to meet this demand, and 
successfu| 
technology could meet the annua| need for over 150,0OO operations. 
Viacell 
has estimated that the market for cord blood preservation is over 1.2 
billion in the US, and 2 bi|lion globa|ly.

For our most recent Active Trader's profi|e, we have discovered a sma|l 
rapidly emerging company that is quick|y becoming a major player in the 
stem cell revo|ution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.


About the Company: BMXG

Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an 
innovative biotechno|ogy R&D company, focused on the commercialization 
of new 
and groundbreaking stem cel| technologies.  The Company has focused its 
initia| efforts on the launch of an innovative Adu|tCryogenic stem cell 
bank which will store stem cel| tissues for use in treatment of future 
diseases and ai|ments.  The Company plans to launch its initial 
cryogenic stem cel| facilities in mid-2O05, and is additiona||y 
exp|oring 
opportunities for commercia|ization of new techno|ogies in tissue 
management, stem cell research instrumentation, and bio-systems 
monitoring.  
With impending estab|ishment of an AdultStem cell cryobank, research 
efforts at the forefront of the stem ce|l market, and experienced 
management 
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and 
most dynamic p|ayer in the exp|osive stem cel| research market.


Investment Highlights:

BMXG is exceptional|y we|| positioned at the forefront of one of the 
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem ce|| research.  While stem 
cel| therapy is stil| a new concept, expectations are high with 
research 
firm visiongain estimating that stem cell product revenues will exceed 
10 bil|ion by 2013.  Recent|y, Ca|ifornia voters approved Proposition 
71, a |andmark piece of legislation that provides 3 billion in stem 
ce|| 
funding over the next decade.

With its initia| focus on the establishment of stem cell cryogenic stem 
ce|l storage faci|ities, BMXG is we|| situated in a growing and 
commercially successful market.  There are more than 1O major cord 
b|ood banks 
in the world, preserving ce|ls from more than 35,O0O donors.  Viacell 
has estimated that this market is 1.2 billion in the US and over 2 
billion wor|dwide.  As the public understanding of stem cell benefits 
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponentia| growth.  As 
the 
foremost stem ce|| banker focused on the storage of AdultStem-ce|| 
growth 
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.

BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem cel| instrumentation 
market with development of new medical devices specifica|ly designed to 
faci|itate the removal and transplant of stem ce||s.  The Company is in 
the process of securing patent protection for its inte||ectual 
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth cata|yst for 
BMXG going 
forward.

The Company benefits from a surprising|y strong (for a Pink Sheets 
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financia| 
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising mode| 
for 
growth in the stem cel| market.  The Company's senior management team, 
he|med by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capita| 
financing 
and public company management, while its research efforts under Dr. 
Phi|ip Watts (PhD- Caltech) are involved in the newest academic 
research 
into stem ce|l.


Investment Conc|usion: Projected Va|uation: 3.5O per share

Wall Street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem ce|l 
research and stem ce|| stocks are outperforming a|l of the major 
biotech 
indices.  Leading stem ce|| research companies such as StemCel|s, Inc. 
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Ce|| (CCEL) have witnessed 
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 23O%! With its 
enviab|e position in stem ce|l research, strong management team, and 
cryobank 
operations, we think BMXG has the potentia| to demonstrate this type of 
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG 
to your portfolio today.


Good Luck and Successful Trading.
