RE: CALIFORNIA 3rd QUARTER PRODUCTION REPORT

Lippman Consulting, Inc. is pleased to announce that it has just completed 
the 3rd quarterly of 2001 gas production report for the state of California. 
This report contains text and graphs depicting various historical statistics. 
The total California production volumes are separated by associated and 
non-associated volumes. The report also separates production by state and 
federal areas as well as onshore and offshore volumes. For the onshore 
volumes, we detail the production down to the district level while for the 
offshore volumes, we detail those down to the field level. In addition to 
showing historical production volumes in various categories, the report also 
provides the reader with monthly net gas storage injection and withdrawal 
volumes along with the total gas volumes in storage for the state. Working 
gas as well as cushion gas levels are also reported.  California is a major 
consuming district and the level of production contained within the state has 
a direct bearing on the amount of gas imports that will be needed to satisfy 
demand.

The cost for this report is $300 on a quarterly subscription basis or the 
report can be purchased on a one time basis for $450.  If you would like 
additional information or to order the report, please feel free to contact me 
by e-mail at Lippmanc@AOL.com or phone at 915-581-1668.

George Lippman,
