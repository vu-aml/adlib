IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.
