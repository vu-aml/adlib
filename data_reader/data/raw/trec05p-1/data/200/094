Rob, 

As requested, attached below is a summary of current CPUC proceedings which are important to Transwestern.  Our focus has been on these five proceedings as in each instance the outcome potentially impacts take-away capacity at the border and end-user rates and terms and conditions of service in our market area.  The proceedings included are:

I99-07-003	GIR/SoCal Unbundling

I00-11-02	Adequacy of SoCal System

A01-09-024	SoCalGas BCAP
A01-10-005	SDG&E BCAP  (consolidated w/SoCal)

A01-10-011	PG&E Gas Accord

I have included the purpose of each proceeding, Transwestern's participation and position when taken, status of each proceeding and key dates for upcoming events.  Please feel free to call me to discuss any of the proceedings or to answer any questions.  On my next trip to Houston, I'll schedule some time to review these proceedings with anyone interested in further discussion.  

Glen
