Subject: Notification of forthcoming fastmail.fm account closure
Message-Id: <20070506152527.186AF1CF@db1.messagingengine.com>

This message is to let you know that your fastmail.fm account
"asvcasfd@fastmail.fm" is scheduled to be closed in 7 days, because you
have not used it for some time. Non-paying accounts are closed after 45
days of inactivity, whilst one-time fee accounts are closed after 120
days of inactivity. If you wish for us to close your account, just do
nothing and we will delete it in 14 days.

If you wish to maintain your account, just login. To login, click here:

Your user name is "asvcasfd@fastmail.fm". If you have lost your
password, click "Lost Password" after clicking the link above,
then type "dasfa@speedy.uwaterloo.ca" (without the quotes) when asked for your

Since you have not used FastMail.FM for a while, you may not be aware
of all the recent improvements and changes. To learn more, see:

To avoid having your account closed due to inactivity in the future, you

"Upgrade Account". If you upgrade to a one-time payment level, you only
have to login every 120 days to maintain your account. On subscription
plans, your account will never be closed due to inactivity.  In
addition, by upgrading you will get more storage, transfer quota, and
many additional features.

Sincerely,
