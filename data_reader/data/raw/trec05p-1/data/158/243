Dear Ken,

I just want to let you know that I as an employee, really appreciate all what you have done to try and get Enron back on the road again. It must be very painful for you to see a company go down especially since you have been there right from its inception. 

I just wanted to ask you if it would be possible for you to give me about 10 minutes of your time sometime this week or probably next week. I would be really happy if I could meet you.

Thank you.

Yours Sincerely,

Vridhay
