Gerald,

Do we have a format for producer gas that is not committed and not pool gas? (i.e. Linder cannot "commit" their gas to us because of credit reasons but the gas is still 100% ours for the month)

Thanks,
Judy

Attached is the form of pooling point purchase GTC for ENA Upstream.  This form still needs further refinements, but for August business I am comfortable to use.  However, John please specifically review the nomination variance language in the confirm.  Upon your approval, Ellen can move forward with August use.  Let me know if you have any questions.
