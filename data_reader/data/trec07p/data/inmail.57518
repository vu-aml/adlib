I should mention the idea I worked on yesterday was cat()ing together
the appropriate condition strings and then ideally printing that entire
concatenated string into the subset argument.  However, as far as I
know, cat() only prints directly on the console and cannot be used to
substitute input text into a function, so I scrapped that idea.

Just figured I'd mention that in case there does happen to be a way to
do such a thing, and someone knows of a way offhand.

Thanks for the quick response, Duncan.

The given code doesn't seem to work, and possibly due to this reason I
found in the online help for missing() (if I understand it correctly):

"Currently missing() can only be used in the immediate body of the
function that defines the argument, not in the body of a nested function
or a local call. This may change in the future."

So as I understand it, missing() cannot refer to the arguments of
function1 if it is used in an argument of subset()?  It seems to remain
a promising function for this situation regardless, but I'm not sure how
I could implement it into the subset() arguments offhand.

Code it like this:

subset(master.frame, (missing(arg1) | a == arg1) &
                      (missing(arg2) | b == arg2) &
                      (missing(arg3) | c == arg3))

I haven't tried this, and I forget what happens in subset() if you pass
it a subset of the wrong length, so it might fail if all args are
missing, but otherwise I think it should work.  It does depend on
defaults for the args existing and not causing errors in the equality
tests (it's not using shortcut evaluation).
