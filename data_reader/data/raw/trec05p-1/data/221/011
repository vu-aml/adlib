 	  	 Dear Andrew,

Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay will not testify at either Congressional hearing this week. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says because of Lay's decision not to appear, the Senate Commerce Committee is expected to authorize the issuance of a subpoena to Lay as early as Tuesday morning. Two House subcommittees could soon issue their own subpoenas as well. A subpoena would compel Lay to appear, but it does not guarantee he will testify - he could invoke his constitutional right not to speak. 

Other hearings involving Enron will proceed as planned, with three hearings scheduled for Tuesday morning. One of the hearings involves Enron board member William Powers, who will testify in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight Subcommittee. Powers led the internal investigation at Enron, resulting in a report released this weekend that was highly critical of the company's management team. We'll have highlights from Powers' testimony on Tuesday from Washington. 

Unsecured creditors can help ensure a better rate of return on what they're owed by Enron through claims trading. That's according to Haynes and Boone LLP Attorney Lenny Parkins. He'll join us during the noon ET newscast from the Houston bureau to discuss the process of claims trading and how creditors can assure they will receive some sort of payment. 

Also from Houston on Tuesday, Williams Gas Pipeline CEO Doug Whisenant talks about pipeline safety following September 11. He'll also discuss the future of Williams Gas Pipelines. 

We'll have more from the one-on-one interview between West Coast Bureau Correspondent Kym McNicholas and California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch. Kym says Lynch will discuss the ongoing negotiations with generators to rework the state's long-term power contracts.
