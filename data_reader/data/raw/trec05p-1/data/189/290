Louise,

About 1 month ago, the process was initiated to disconnect the direct connections.

Experience showed that we were spending money on something which provided little benefit to the customer.

There is a chance that this process was not completed for every company (I am checking).

I intend to ensure that the direct connections are all converted to regular internet connections.

If you want the direct connections maintained, please let me know.

Dave
