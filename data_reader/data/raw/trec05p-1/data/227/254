Hey guys here is some more information for you to digest. If everyone would like to stay at the same hotel we can get a block of rooms for a cheaper rate (about $150), I just need the names of those people, or you can make you own plans. Hotels further away from the downtown area are a little cheaper, but it might be worth the price not to fight the traffic on Thursday morning. All three of these hotels are within walking distance to the office. (One to two blocks)

Downtown Hotels
Hyatt  713-654-1234
Rate - $220 per night
Doubletree  713 -759-0202
Rate - $245
Crown Plaza  713-739-8800
Rate - $194
