NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Mi|lennium 
Nationa| Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has 
entered 
into negotiations to acquire all or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Mil|ennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.

 
Mil|ennium earlier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering 
into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both loca| De|ray Beach-based companies could integrate the two 
entities. "Basica||y we're both from the same industry, and together I 
be|ieve 
we could be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-alone companies," 
said Robert McA||ister, CEO & President of Millennium Nationa| Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Millennium's offers and be|ieve that there cou|d be 
a possible f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McA||ister a|so feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Mi|lennium shareho|ders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overal| business plan. It has always been our 
intent to 
target and acquire successfu|, high-profi|e events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. Conso|idation 
is the key, not only to our bottom line, but also to the success of 
each individual event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mi|lennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition u|timately being ab|e to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom line.

MNEI sees both the international te|evision audience and the ability to 
attract a Fortune 50O as a potential source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McA||ister expects the dea| to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Mi||ennium ITC inc|udes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michael Gambill and James B|ake. Also entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), currently at No. 25, 
two-time 
Mi||ennium ITC finalist Xavier Ma|isse (Belgium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Mel|o (Brazi|). The tournament stil| holds two wildcards that 
can 
be offered to other top players in the weeks leading up to the event.
