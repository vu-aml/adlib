I made a few changes.  Please use this version.  Janie, if you are satisfied as it is, please run it by Mike, Barry and Stephanie.  I didn't realize it was due tomorrow until this afternoon (I was operating under the assumption that it was due 10/25 - don't know why!).  I'm not sure we can file it electronically, so it may have to be e-mailed to the D.C. office.  If so, we would need the final copy by 2:00.

Thanks.
