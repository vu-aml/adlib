Gary,

Henry did fax me some of the literature, but the quality of the fax is such that it is hard to read.  I am meeting with Jack tomorrow at 10:30, how about I stop by and see you.

Thanks, Kim.

Gary,

We just received this information regarding our new corporate expense card.  I'm not sure I see any benefits by getting one of the new Wright Travel Cards vs. using the EFCU.  Would you please look this over and let me know your thoughts.  If I choose to stay with the EFCU, I would probably like to get  a different card from the current EFCU Master Card so that I can keep my business and personal charges separate.  

Can you provide me your thoughts?

Thanks, Kim.

I am pleased to announce completion of negotiations with Wright Express to provide a travel and entertainment program for Enron Operations Services Company.   Travel and entertainment cards will be provided to any individual employed by the pipeline companies, who is required to travel on company business.   Each employee will be required to complete the attached application and agreement form, secure management approval and fax to Mary Ann Johnson at (713) 345-3479.   The T&E card will be mailed directly to the applicant. 

Implementation
Employees may use the T&E cards for domestic and international business travel.  Monthly, each employee will be required to complete an expense report utilizing the XMS system, if expenses are incurred.  https://expensexms.enron.com/ewp/ .    Approved business travel expenses will be reimbursed to the employee via direct deposit or check, depending on how your payroll is currently processed.  Personal use of the card is discouraged.

The Wright Express travel and entertainment card has contingent liability, whereas, the employee's personal credit may be evaluated if:
*	Outstanding balances exceeding $3,500 or delinquent payments beyond 25 days past the due date.
*	A monthly line of credit for business travel exceeding $3,500.

Employees who are required to travel on Company business and expect to exceed the monthly $3,500 spending limit, may request a higher limit.  If you routinely require a spending limit exceeding $3,500 per month, please check the box under "Company Information" on the attached application form.  Your request will be submitted to Enron Operations Service Management and Wright Express for approval.  You will be notified of approval or denial concerning your request.
	
All travel and entertainment MasterCard accounts are due each month to Wright Express.  Failure, by the employee to pay Wright Express each month, submit expense reports or submit receipts may trigger card cancellation.

Procedure
The travel and entertainment procedure can be found on the ETS website at http://www.ets.enron.com/pandSM/Employees will be responsible to review this procedure and comply with all requirements.  Following receipt of the signed, approved application and employee agreement form, employees should expect to receive a T&E credit card within ten to fifteen working days, but no later than March 15, 2002.

Card Activation:
Upon receipt of the travel and entertainment card, you will be required to follow the instructions on the sticker using the activation call-in number.  Following activation, you may immediately begin to use your T&E card.

Rewards Program
Wright Express travel card holders may participate in a rewards program, which is outlined in an attached document.  All fees charged by Wright Express for the rewards program is the employee's personal responsibility. 

Please address all questions concerning the travel and entertainment program to Bruce Martin 713-345-1833, Cheri Sublet 713-345-3475, Mary Ann Johnson 713-345-3479 or Morris Brassfield 713-646-7006.
