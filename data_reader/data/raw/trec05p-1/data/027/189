SOLICITOR GENERAL SAYS DBE PROGRAM DISPUTED BY ADARAND IS
CONSTITUTIONAL

In a long-running federal contracting dispute with
implications for workplace affirmative action programs,
Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson files a brief with the
U.S. Supreme Court arguing that the Department of
Transportation's "disadvantaged business enterprise" program
is constitutional ("Adarand Constructors Inc. v. Mineta,
"U.S., No. 00-730, "DOJ brief filed" 8/10/01). Olson,
appointed by President Bush, continues on the path taken by
former Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman, a Clinton
appointee, in a brief filed this past January opposing
Adarand Constructors Inc.'s petition for Supreme Court
review.

Adarand, a white-owned installer of highway guardrails
located in Colorado Springs, Colo., initially filed suit in
1989 after losing a subcontract to install guardrails for
DOT's Federal Highway Administration to a small,
minority-owned, disadvantaged business. In a landmark 1995
ruling, the Supreme Court held federal race-based measures
must meet strict scrutiny. The Tenth Circuit in September
2000 ruled the revised DBE program passed constitutional
muster even under strict scrutiny. Oral argument is
scheduled for Oct. 31. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-1

HONEST BELIEF OF JOB ABANDONMENT DEFENSE TO FMLA SUIT, COURT
RULES

A Denver employer can argue that it did not violate the
Family and Medical Leave Act by firing an employee who took
leave after her father had a heart attack because it had a
good faith belief that she abandoned her job, the Tenth
Circuit rules ("Medley v. Polk Co.,  "10th Cir.,  No.
00-1199,  8/9/01 ).

Reversing a $273,194 judgment for Vickie R. Medley and
remanding for a new trial, Judge Owen finds that the lower
court erred in declining Polk Company's requested jury
charge that an employer who honestly believes it is
discharging an employee for misusing FMLA leave is not
liable even if the employer is mistaken. Federal appellate
and district courts unanimously have held "that an employer
who discharges an employee honestly believing that the
employee has abandoned her job and is otherwise not using
FMLA leave ... would not be in violation of FMLA, even if
its conclusion is mistaken, since this would not be a
discriminatory firing," Owen concludes. . . . Page A-1

OPERATING ENGINEERS IN CALIFORNIA, NEVADA APPROVE NEW
CONTRACTS

Members of International Union of Operating Engineers Local
12 approve new labor agreements with several contractor
associations that provide wage and benefit increases
totaling $4.65 per hour for approximately 10,000 equipment
operators in the Los Angeles, San Diego, and Las Vegas
metropolitan areas. New in the IUOE agreements is expanded
jurisdiction for union members in a broad range of
construction inspection tasks.

Meanwhile, Laborers' International Union Local 89 in San
Diego approves a three-year, $3.40 per hour contract for
about 600 tradesmen on highway and utility projects. . . .

SEIU MEMBERS RATIFY CONTRACT WITH AMERICAN MEDICAL RESPONSE
WEST

American Medical Response West and Service Employees
International Union Local 250 agree they have a "totally
ratified" labor contract and the union withdraws a 10-day
strike notice. The five-year master agreement covers 18
different bargaining units of some 2,200 paramedics,
emergency medical technicians, dispatchers, and other
workers who provide emergency and nonemergency ambulance
service in 20 Northern California counties.

Workers voted last month on a tentative agreement that was
reached June 30. When the ballots were tallied Aug. 1,
employees in three bargaining units had rejected the pact
and the union issued a strike notice for facilities in three
counties. The company took the position that there could not
be a strike because a majority of the employees had accepted
the master agreement. The union's attorney also later took
that position. . . . Page A-2

AIDS IN THE WORKPLACE: SOME OLD PROBLEMS PERSIST, NEW ISSUES
ARISE

Recent medical advances in the treatment of AIDS and HIV
mean individuals with the disease can lead much longer,
healthier lives, and be at work and productive for a longer
time. "We're at a very dangerous stage in the epidemic, and
that's the stage of complacency,"  warns Peter Petesch,
co-chair of the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention's Business Responds to AIDS program.
Workplace training and education about HIV/AIDS has slipped
down the employer priority list as the disease has gotten
less and less publicity, says Petesch. People have come to
view AIDS as an illness that can be ignored, he adds.

Nancy Breuer, an HIV/AIDS workplace training specialist,
says employers make a mistake with regard to HIV-positive
employees when they "focus on their diagnosis instead of
focusing on their productivity." Victor Barnes, director of
the CDC's Business Responds to AIDS and Labor Responds to
AIDS programs, asserts that workplace HIV/AIDS policies are
crucial in addressing the main issues surrounding the
disease, including workplace accommodations,
confidentiality, benefits, discrimination and the Americans
with Disabilities Act, and co-worker concerns. "It's
critical that workplace policies are in place," he says. . .
