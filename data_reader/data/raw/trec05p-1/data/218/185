 	  	 Dear Andrew,

Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay breaks his silence - Lay is expected to testify in front of a Congressional hearing on Monday. We are planning to provide live coverage of the entire hearing in addition to our regular newscasts. Our Washington bureau will also be reporting live from the hearing every hour with updates. The hearing is one of 12 scheduled in Congress next week related to the Enron collapse. 

In addition to appearances by Lay, former CEO Jeff Skilling and former CFO Andrew Fastow will testify Thursday in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The Washington bureau will track this hearing, and any others that may have an impact on the energy sector. 

Our Houston bureau will also have reaction to former Enron CEO Ken Lay's testimony in Washington. 

In the first legal showdown over electricity deregulation in Texas, two state agencies are entangled in a lawsuit over rates set under the state's deregulation program. The Office of the Public Utility Council is suing the Public Utility Commission over the rates a default provider can charge in the western service territory for TXU Corporation. We'll have all the details from the Houston bureau on Monday. 

West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas talks with California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch about the proposed Rate Agreement with the California Department of Water Resources. Lynch says the PUC, DWR and Wall Street made a number of compromises in order for an acceptable deal to materialize. 

Director of the California Department of Finance Timothy Gage also talks with Kym about the proposed Rate Agreement between the CPUC and the CDWR. He'll discuss the bridge loans that will hold the state over until $12.5 billion in consumer-backed energy bonds are issued. Gage will also discuss the state's budget crisis and how to secure California's energy future on Monday. 

E Source Energy Industry Analyst Matthew Joyce comes to us from Boulder on Monday during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast. Joyce has the latest on what former Enron customers are doing since the fall of the energy giant.
