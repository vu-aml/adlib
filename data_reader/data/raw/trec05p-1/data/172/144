I've located the Gas Nomination information that was prepared for Dec. 01 and updated to include Jan. 02 business.
The Dec.01 numbers differ slightly from the initial numbers generated by James Centilli at TW as well as the numbers
that Stephanie Miller conveyed in her Dec. 18th memo.  

These values are based on the nomination worksheets & actual power bills from he respective utilities. 

Thanks
