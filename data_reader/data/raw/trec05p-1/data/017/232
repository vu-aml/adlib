Hey!  Good to hear from you.  Yes, it is sad about Randa but we are all
thinking about her and praying for her.  I hope she found a job by now - I
think she was laid off during 1Q lay offs!  Her husband is still working
her, so that is good at least one of them still has a job at least.

Meghan - I forgot her name already!  I bet she is a cutie.  I just saw my
niece in Colorado Springs - it was her 3rd birthday this past Sunday so I
got to celebrate it with her.  We had a party for her and I don't think I
saw so many 2 and 3 year olds in my life!  They kept wanting to eat
something - anything.   Are kids always that hungry?  It was hilarious.  I
can't believe she is talking in complete sentences either.  I'm shocked at
how time really flies by.  Yes, it seems just like yesterday she was born.
I think that is neat that Kellyn (my niece) and Meghan are close in age.
I'll have to be sure to remember that!

No huge vacations for us..my husband and I bought a house in Magnolia May
2000 - 1 month before I got laid off - so all our money has been going into
the house for the past year.  I bet you didn't know about it because I don't
think they gave me a chance to say goodbye to anyone when they let us go.
I'm wondering, did you even know I got laid off?  I can't remember anymore.
Its been such a long time.  Besides the Colorado trip I just took, we are
going to Connecticut next week for my husband's family reunion, so it will
be nice to be in cool weather again.  How about you guys?  Are you still the
jetsetters of Houston?

I know we probably won't see each other but Marilyn and I talk about you
once in a while and how much fun and interesting you were.  If ever you are
in the neighborhood, please give us a call and we would love to see you,
okay?  Take care.

Hi,
I am doing terrific!  I would have written sooner, but I just got back
from a business trip.

I do miss the old lunch gang...how are things going?  Which group are
you guys in now?  Randa told me she had received a severance package and
is currently looking for a job.  Sounds like a lot of people have
left...

Thanks for asking about Meghan (that's so sweet).  Can you believe she
is about to turn 3 in a couple of weeks?!?!  How's your niece, the one
that is the same age?  Doesn't it seem like just yesterday that she was
born?

Have you guys been on more terrific vacations?  Email me details...talk
soon!

Remember me?  Marilyn Rice and I were talking about our old group and
your
name came up.  We are both wondering how you are so I decided to shoot
you
an email.  We would love to hear how you are and how you little girl is
doing, etc.

We miss seeing you!  Take care - ps
