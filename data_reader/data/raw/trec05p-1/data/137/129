Sorry for the late reply, but I've been on the road and am now down with a nasty case of the flu.

From Enron and Dynegy's standpoint, there is a binding contract between NWN and Enron for the sale of PGE.  To borrow your analogy:  (1)there is only one suitor--NWN; (2)there's no reason to be envious, NWN is a wonderful bride/groom.

Re:  Dynegy.  Dynegy remains committed to the transaction.  At this juncture, Dynegy is
analyzing Oregon law to determine how it applies to them ... so it's
premature to discuss 511.

We hope that everyone can stay focused on the NWN transaction--at this
point it is the only proposal for the acquisition of PGE pending before
the OPUC.

Hope you are well.  Give me a call if you have any questions.  I hope to back in the office tomorrow--although another day of saltine crackers, soap operas, and chicken soup is appealing.

On the other hand, does anyone doubt that Dynegy's acquisition of Enron with
PGE would necessitate a 511 filing to exercise influence?  The NW Natural
acquisition is not a done deal (the application hasn't even been filed).  So
does Dynegy assume that approval or does it prepare an application of its
own?  That would be a first: two simultaneous 511 applications over the same
company.  I would be real envious of PGE (not one, but two suitors) if I
wasn't married (and unable to buy stock in the company).
Jason
