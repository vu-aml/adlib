Lynn,

Wisconsin Electric needs to stay with whoever is assigned Wisconsin Gas, the payments for both are sent in under the same wire.

WP&L and Interstate Power are listed under both Jean and Karen.

All else looks good.

Thanks,

Renee

	Team, I would like for you to review the attached Shipper assignment list.  With Renee leaving and
	Pat still on a learning curve, I wanted to throw out some possibilities and get your input.  I did not
	spend a lot of time on interconnects, so you may want to look at those closely.  I did talk with John,
	Terry, Raetta and Larry for input.  Please review, discuss and set up some time to visit with me about
	your comments.  Thanks. Lynn
