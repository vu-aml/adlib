Tracy -- 
What exactly am I supposed to be providing for this request?  There hasn't been a lot of guidance provided to me for this and I'm not really sure what "savings" we're talking about.  Any clarification you can provide me would be appreciated.  

Thanks,
Phil

	In order to measure the savings on a monthly as well as legal entity basis, we have added two tabs to the file sent earlier this week and modified the original tabs.  Please complete the tabs with the monthly spend of your original 2002 Plan (can be total yr. divided by 12) for gross and net for each of your functions.  The totals should feed to the tabs containing your new numbers.  You can send all the data in one file on Monday, or you can send the first file for Monday and this new version on Tuesday.  Please contact me, should you have any questions.
