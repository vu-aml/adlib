Rob covered his face at the flash, but finding himself unhurt he took away
his hands and with blinking eyes attempted to look at a wonderful radiance
which seemed to fill the room, making it many times brighter than the
brightest day. Although at first completely dazzled, he peered before him
until he discovered that the light was concentrated near one spot, from
which all the glorious rays seemed to scintillate
He closed his eyes a moment to rest them; then re-opening them and shading
them somewhat with his hands, he made out the form of a curious Being
standing with majesty and composure in the center of the magnificent
radiance and looking down upon him! 2
