I'm just faxing it to you right now, so keep an eye out for it!

Just to let you know, I'm taking Monday off, so if you're looking for anything, you can e-mail Linda Sietzema, or if you can wait until Tuesday, I'll be happy to deal with anything then.

Thanks,
Sharon

Hi, Sharon!

Bet you thought you had heard the last from me.  Can you get me a copy of a physical gas master between ECC and Producers Marketing Ltd.?  Our Credit group gave me the document no. 96013847.

By the way, I received the BP Amoco documents.

Thanks!

Marie
