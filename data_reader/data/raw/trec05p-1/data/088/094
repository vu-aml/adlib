If, at it now appears is the case, that Rosman, Choi and Malowney shift over to report to Calger, we are soon going to have legal resource allocation political risk.  We need to talk to Elizabeth about hedging this risk soon.----cgy

Christian, 

This reminds me of the custom where two warring tribes would make peace by each sending a group of children to live with the other tribe.  Concern for the safety of the children encouraged each side to keep the peace.
