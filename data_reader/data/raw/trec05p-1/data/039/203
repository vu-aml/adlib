I was concerned about having to have the Washington DC and Houston people travel on Sunday. When I checked schedules, I found that Delta 443/759 (Dp 6:45 am -- Connect Cincinnati -- Ar 11:07) might work on Monday for the Washington people.  From Houston, 1647/1063 (Dp 8:05 am -- Connect Salt Lake -- Ar 11:59am) would work to avoid Sunday travel.  United probably has similar offerings through Denver.  If people prefer non-stop Continental flights, Sunday flights are probably needed.

Dear Western Government Affairs folk,

This message is to request you check your calendars and your availability for a western region meeting in Portland to be held on Monday October 1, starting at 12:00 PM through 6PM and Tuesday October 2 from 8:00 AM through 12:00 PM.  Please let me know whether or not you can make the proposed dates.  (Lysa and Debra, can you please check Paul and Tim's calendars for their availability?)

For those of you who had planned on attending in September, I am sorry to again cause you this inconvenience.   Hopefully for everyone who wanted to attend, but couldn't, this will offer you the opportunity to participate on October 1 and 2.

Due to the volume of new policy related issues in our region since the meeting was originally scheduled, I would expect there will be some modifications to our previously distributed agenda below.  When  you have an opportunity, please review the agenda below and send any updates to me asap so I can formalize the agenda and distribute it to the group.


Dear All,

As a result of the recent volume of activity in Washington DC, with mediation proceedings, refund discussions and the need for key members of our team that need to attend these meetings, it has been decided to re-schedule the meeting of the Western Government Affairs group to Wednesday, September 12, in Portland, 10AM-5PM.

For those of you who had planned on attending, I am sorry to cause you this inconvenience.  Hopefully for those of you who wanted to attend, but couldn't, this will offer you the opportunity to participate on September 12.

Due to the volatility of policy related issues in our region, I would expect there may be some modifications to our current agenda below.  As these changes occur I will communicate this information to you.

Any questions or concerns, please contact me.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Subject:	Draft Agenda for - Western Government Affairs Meeting

Below is a draft agenda for our planned meeting on Wednesday August 1 in Portland Oregon from 10-5.  Tim Belden will be joining us from11:30-1PM (thanks Debra) and the agenda is taking Tim's time into account.  We will be meeting in the Mt. Hood Room, a working lunch will be provided (thanks Lysa).  

If you would like to modify the agenda, please send your edits to me.

10:00  	Meeting called to order - Brief Introductions - All
10:10  	Overview of Western Government Affairs Priorities (Jim or designee?)
11:00  	What are the short-term needs of our Western Commerical Staff? (Alan?)
11:30  	Brief Overview of July 12 Rulings and discussion of the potential impacts on the West (Ray/Christi/Sarah? and Group)
12:30  	RTO/ISO Status Update (in alphabetical order)
		CAISO			(Sue)
		DSTAR			(Dave)
		RTO West		(Steve)
2:00	RTO Strategy discussion "How we move forward and how we should leverage the recent FERC July 12 rulings"  			(Group/Jim?)
3:30	Meetings, RTO's and WSCC	-	Ranking and Coverage coordination (Group)
4:30	Northwest OASIS "Enhancements" - Solicitation of Trader Comments (Dave)  (Note, Alan, can you please ask Diana, 		Sean and Bill Williams III to see if they can schedule time to attend?)

While developing this agenda from everyone's input I was thinking that NERC is beginning to assert more and more influence (good or bad) on the entire industry.  I would like to know if our group feels it would be useful to invite either Charles Yeung or Andy Rodriquez to our meeting to overview NERC activities and or Electronic Scheduling?

Also, if Steve Hall has any legal or contract issues he'd like to discuss during our meeting I'll be happy to add time for that.

Again, as noted above this is a draft and as you can see I have un-democratically nominated (suggested) folks for leading various discussions.  Any comments or confirmations of commitment to lead an agenda item would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for everyone's input.

Kind Regards,

Dave
