Murray,
 
Don't know if Evan got with you are nit, but the CSC responsibilities transferred to my group.  Bob Gresch can answer all questions for you.  Additionally, I'd be happy to chat with you on any suggestions or any insights you have.  Beth, Evan and I will be there next week, so we have a great opportunity.

Even,

Who do I need to contact to see a copy of the current Enron to CSC project request log.

Do we have a listing which contains the following information:

Request description

Requestor

Date of request

Quantifiable justification for request

Cost to Enron for CSC to do the request

Enron's priority of request

Enron's preferred date of completion

CSC targeted date of completion.

CSC current status (% complete)

Is there a formal reporting process of these requests and is there a group who manages the priorities to make sure they are in-line with the current business needs.

Can you also tell me if CSC is off on their cost estimate for doing a project does Enron get billed actual project cost or just estimated costs?

Any information you can provide related to this request would be appreciated.

Thanks - MO
