Please also include Glencore AG on this list as we are holding a $459,375 LC that expires 12/30.  Do we have any right to draw?

EGLI is holding a $420,000 LC that expires 12/21/01 covering a deal with Energy Service Providers LLC.  According to our records, this deal has terminated.  Have we been paid?  Are we owed anything?  Would we have any grounds for drawing prior to the expiry date?


ERAC is also holding a $3,922,500 LC that expires on 12/21.  What is the status of this deal?
