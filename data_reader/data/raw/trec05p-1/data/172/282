I am forwarding a message from Rod Adair. It is my understanding that Rod
drew ALL the plans and does not back any of them, as he can't, considering
his role in this process. That makes sense. Rod drew plan G which is the
plan Frank Sanchez (a Democrat) directed him to draw. I am still in favor of
Plan C, which puts the districts up for grabs to either Democrat or
Republican. That is the way these districts should be drawn. It should not
be a safe seat for either side.

The Commission will also vote for the Chairman. Some are indicating that
they will vote for Eloy Ortega, who is a Democrat. We have 4 County
Commissioners who are Republican and 1 who is a Democrat. Why should any of
our commissioners vote for a Democrat to be Chairman?
The executive board of the Republican Party passed a resolution last Friday
that we resolve, as officers of the Republican Party, to encourage
Republicans who are elected to serve in public office to promte fellow
Republicans to positions of leadership and authority at each and every
opportunity.

As fellow Republicans in Chaves County we need to call and let our
Republican County Commissioners know they should elect a REPUBLICAN to serve
as chairman and leader of that board.

> >I'm forwarding this in regards to the County Commission meeting on
Friday...I have talked to Rod Adair in the past about how he draws a
district. The way he draws districts is fair for both sides. It makes a
district available to a Democrat, as well as, a Republican and may the
hardest worker win. This whole notion of "majority minority" districts is
offensive because it indicates that minoirities don't think for themselves
and vote for the candidate or the party of their choice, they instead vote
in a block. That means Democrats want minorities in a block because in their
mind they do now and will always vote Democrat. If that is true, they are
drawing lines in favor of themselves and don't forget, Frank Sanchez is a
Democrat. Rod's plan is fair for both sides. I'm backing HIS plan. I'm
planning on being there.

Frank Sanchez's proposal which is outrageous in many ways....  Not only does
it change district 4 by leaps and bounds to the democrats advantage, but why
would they vote for this Sanchez Plan G over Rod's plan C??????   This is
just opening the gate for them and Rod is the professional here, not this
guy.
