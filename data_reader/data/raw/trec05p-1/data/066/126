After discussions with Elizabeth Sager and Leslie Hansen, we have developed a few additions to the EOL Paperless Confirm Amendment form to clarify that (1) neither party shall (not just that neither party is required to) send paper confirms, and (2) the transaction's records on EOL control over any conflicting terms in the underlying Governing Agreement. I have attached a draft below of a Consent and Agreement for Idacorp with the proposed changes in italics (see Para. 1(a)(i) and 3). We made this last change in anticipation of revised EOL power product definitions, which new definitions will conflict with important terms (such as the force majeure clause) in the Power Master.  If you don't want any of these proposed changes to be made to the form as a whole, and would prefer that they be handled in the Power Annex so as to apply only to Power, please let me know.
