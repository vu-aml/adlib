What's up bro? Sorry I didn't respond on Friday - I was out and I never 
bothered to check my email. Enron is a good reason to move back to Houston - 
great company. I'm not heading to Homecoming and I don't think anyone our 
age or older is going back. Plus I don't think we are allowed back after 5 
year reunion. Which reminds me, where were you? You were missed.

Anyway, here's my numbers:

Work - 201-413-3584
Home - 201-792-4220
Cell - 917-603-7033
