SATCON ANNOUNCES CERTIFICATION OF ITS PHOTOVOLTAIC POWERGATE(R)
INVERTERS FOR COMMERCIAL PHOTOVOLTAIC APPLICATIONS 

Alternative Energy Subsidiary's Backlog Exceeds $21 Million 

SatCon Technology Corporation(R) (Nasdaq CM: SATC), a developer of power
management and system architecture solutions for the alternative energy
and distributed power markets today announced that it has obtained
certification of its PowerGate(R) Inverter product-line for commercial
photovoltaic applications to the new UL standard coming into effect May
7, 2007. In January of 2006, SatCon announced certification under the
new UL1741 of its innovative ground fault detection interrupter (patent
pending) resulting in significant savings for installers of photovoltaic
systems. This new certification for the entire product-line is a follow
on to that approval. 

With SatCon's continued industry leadership, its wholly owned
subsidiary, SatCon Power Systems Canada is pleased to report that as of
the date of this press release its backlog has grown from the $16
million reported in December of 2006 to over $21 million today. This
backlog has grown while revenues have increased over 200% to $8.6
million in the last six months of 2006 as compared to the same period of
2005. 

"Our strategy to focus our alternative energy business and complementary
power distribution products continues to drive our backlog and revenue
growth", said Clemens van Zeyl, President of SatCon's Power Systems
subsidiary. "With approval of our existing product-line to the new UL
standard in hand, our focus will now be on the introduction of our next
generation PowerGate(R) Inverter designed for increased capacity while
offering additional value added features to our customers".
