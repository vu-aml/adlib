IN THE NEWS...
Diabetes Increase Means More General Practitioner Involvement
Due to its alarming increase in prevalence in the last twenty years,
diabetes has gone from a "secondary care" or specialty issue to being a
condition in which every primary care physician must be competent to
diagnose and manage.  This article from Pulse recognizes the need for
general practice physicians to expand their diabetes resources and
become more aggressive in diagnosis and treatment.

Lifestyle Remains Key Diabetes Risk
A recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine reevaluated the
landmark 1980-1996 Nurses Health Study, in which nearly 85,000 female
nurses aged 30 to 55 were regularly monitored for dietary intake,
smoking status, alcohol intake and physical activity.  Diabetes was
newly identified in 3,300 subjects in the study.  Lack of exercise, a
poor diet and current smoking were all associated with a significantly
increased risk of diabetes.

Childhood Obesity Becoming Global Problem
Childhood obesity in the United States has grown to epidemic levels, say
public health officials.  Now, a recent study led by researchers at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill finds that growing numbers
of young people in China and Russia are also overweight and obese.

Native American Conference Suggests Traditional Lifestyles
According to the U.S. Indian Health Service, there were very few, if
any, known cases of diabetes among Native Americans before 1936.
However, today Native Americans have the highest incidence of any ethnic
group for type 2 diabetes. Earlier this week in Tulsa, OK delegates from
40 Native American tribes, representatives from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, and various
health professionals attended the "Return to Your Roots" conference to
examine ways to combat this troubling public health program.  Much of
the conference focused on adopting traditional Native American lifestyle
habits as a means to improve their health.
