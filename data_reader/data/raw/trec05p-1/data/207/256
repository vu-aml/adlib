Hi baby,
 
I sure did miss you last night. I can't wait to see you tonight and give you a great big kiss on the lips. I love our picture together, we are such a cute couple. I'm sure we are going to have tons of fun together.
How did you sleep? 
I'm worried about you on your trip tomorrow. We should go get you some chains tonight for the truck.
Work is going pretty good so far, hopefully it will stay that way. 
I love you and I can't wait to see you.
Have a great day honey.
 
I LOVE YOU!
 
Craig.
