Every Friday in October and November, Jim Studebaker and/or I will facilitate an EDI discussion for customer service reps working the weekend.  Please attend this EDI training on Friday, October 26 from 2:30-3:00 in EB42C2. The discussion will include a review of the TMS quick response and diagnostic tool screens and the Team EDI web page.  Questions related to EDI and problem resolution will also be discussed. 

If you have already attended, you do not need to attend again.  However, if you have any EDI questions, please feel free to attend again.

We look forward to seeing you at the meeting.

Jim and Mary
