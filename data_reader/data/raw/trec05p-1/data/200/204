Subject: Columbia Gas Invoices

Columbia Gas sent me the December invoices via federal express.  The cover
letter states that Columbia Gas is aware that ENA will not be paying the
pre-petition amounts but that they expect full payment for the
post-petition amounts.

I'm sending you a copy of the letter.  I assume that we will not be paying
any of the invoice.

Any news on the Columbia Gas park & loans?

Thanks
chris
