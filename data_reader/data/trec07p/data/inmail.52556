CNN Tonight: TB Traveler and Family Speak Out!

In their first primetime interview, the TB traveler and
his family give their side of the story on the global
health scare that set off alarms over homeland security.

Plus, the CDC director responds to their account of
the incident just hours after she and the TB traveler
testified in today’s dramatic congressional hearings.
How could this have happened?
