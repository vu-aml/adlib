NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=235249&>, RB SD - Hunter Updated 12/06/01
Tomlinson will face the usually tough Philadelphia defense in Week 13. Still, he is a must-start player because of his regular touches and TD production, 

Dwayne Carswell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1328&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/06/01
Carswell has become a top target for the injury-riddled Broncos. He is definitely worth starting as Denver plays an important AFC West game against Seattle. 

Koren Robinson <http://football299.fant! as! y.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=235239&>, WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/06/01
Robinson has done little to impress Fantasy players in his rookie year. Don't use him unless your team is ultra-thin at wide receiver.

Darrell Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 12/06/01
Jackson is a solid start this week. The Seahawks are playing in a pivotal game at Denver, and Matt Hasselbeck will give his top receiver a lot of important looks.

Jerry Rice <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1291&>, WR OAK - Neal/McKay Updated 12/06/01
Rice may be good for at least one TD catch this week. The Kansas City secondary may have trouble with the veteran receiver on slant and crossing patterns. 

Charlie Garner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 12/06/01
Garner should easily approach the 100-yard mark against the Chiefs. Kansas City's inconsistent front seven will have trouble with the slashing, speedy back. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 12/06/01
Gonzalez hasn't performed up to expectations this year. St! il! l, he may be motivated to play well in AFC West game with the archrival Raiders.

Derrick Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 12/06/01
Alexander has been nearly useless as a Fantasy player this season. Don't expect him to do much at Oakland this week.

Priest Holmes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1645&>, RB KC - Russell Updated 12/06/01
Holmes is a must-start player, and the Raiders have been vulnerable to the run in recent weeks. Expect another 100-yard game from Holmes this week.

Trent Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 12/06/01
Don't start Green this week unless your Fantasy team is thin at QB. He may have a very forgettable day at Oakland. The Raiders will have something to prove after being upset by Arizona. 

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/06/01
Even against the weak Colts defense, Gadsden is a risky start. He has been a big disappointment this year, and he doesn't seem to fit in well with a Miami offense that now seems to stretch the field more often.

Jay Fiedler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.! co! m/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=12363&>, QB MIA - Tori Updated 12/06/01
The erratic Fiedler should be a good start this week. He should do reasonably well in a Monday Night game against an AFC East team with a weak defense (Indianapolis). 

Trevor Insley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=188095&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/06/01
Insley (head) is listed as probable for Monday Night's game. He is not worth adding to a roster unless injuries continue to be a factor at the WR spot for Indianapolis.

Reggie Wayne <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=235256&> , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/06/01
Wayne missed last week's game with a knee injury, but he is not listed on this week's injury report. He is still a risky start because of his inexperience.

Marvin Harrison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1231&>, WR IND - Russell Updated 12/06/01
Expect another big game from Harrison this week. He will definitely do well in the Monday Night spotlight against an AFC East foe.

Peyton Manning <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=12531&>, QB IND - Neal/McKay Updated 12/06/01
Manning's performance at Miami may include h! er! oics and mistakes. He should be able to burn the Dolphins' defense for more than one TD, yet he may also make more than one turnover.

Antowain Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 12/06/01
Smith is a must-start player at this point of the season. He is a regular TD threat no matter who he faces.

Tom Brady <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=187741&>, QB NE - Martin Updated 12/06/01
Brady could find TDs hard to come by in Week 13. The Browns' defense may be fired up to perform well after getting embarrassed by Tennessee last week.

Peerless Price <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/06/01
Price's production has slowed a bit recently, but he should be a good start in Week 13. Carolina may have trouble handling the Buffalo passing game.

Stephen Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/06/01
Alexander continues to insist that he has a chance to play against the season, according to the Washington Post. He suffered a fractured bone in his lower leg against Dallas, and is out indefinitely at this point. Walter Rasby and Zeron Flemister will split time at tight end in his absence. 

Eric Moulds <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1196&>, WR BUF - Bass/Hull Updated 12/06/01
Moulds is definitely a solid start this week. The Bills should have a good offensive game against Carolina.

Travis Henry <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=235216&>, RB BUF - Martin Updated 12/06/01
Henry may be good for a TD run this week. Buffalo should be able to get him some goal-line opportunities against Carolina.

Terry Hardy <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=12423&>, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 12! /0! 6/01
Hardy (knee) was placed on injured reserve Thursday by the Arizona Cardinals. The Arizona Republic reports that Tywan Mitchell will be the starting tight end in his absence. 

Alex Van Pelt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1011&>, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/06/01
Van Pelt should rebound from an off week against the 49ers. Expect him to throw at least two TD passes against the Panthers.

Anthony Becht <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=187740&>, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/06/01
If you have another tight end available, sit Becht this week. He won't be open often ! ag! ainst the Pittsburgh defense.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 12/06/01
This will be another disappointing week for Chrebet. The Steelers will definitely limit his statistical output.

Joe Jurevicius <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=12484&>, WR NYG - Giggles Updated 12/06/01
Jurevicius was forced to leave Wednesday's practice due to a hamstring injury. Despite the injury, Jurevicius is expected to play on Sunday against Dallas. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=13! 21! &>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/06/01
Walls is now listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Buffalo. Walls, who injured his ankle during last week's game vs. New Orleans, is a risky Fantasy player in Week 13 unless his status is upgraded. 

Curtis Martin <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1132&>, RB NYJ - Tori Updated 12/06/01
Martin will face a tough Pittsburgh defense this week, but there is no way you should reserve him. He has arguably been the most reliable RB in Fantasy Football this year.

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/0! 6/! 01
According to the Charlotte Observer, Muhammad is expected to start on Sunday against Buffalo. Muhammad, who has missed two games due to a shoulder injury, has returned to practice and looked as though he could return. "There's always a possibility (he won't play), but the way he practiced I'd say so," coach George Seifert said. "I guess I'd say cautiously optimistic." Barring any setbacks with his health, starting Muhammad in deeper leagues is worth considering.
