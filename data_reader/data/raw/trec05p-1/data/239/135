I was just curious.............. I don't want to see you go.  I too, haven't spoke to Stan for a week or so.  He's looked awful stressed lately.  I'm just trying to stay low and out of his way.  I'll talk to you later.

I haven't visited with Stan lately.  Why do you ask?  I know he has a lot going and doesn't have the crystal ball that I and others are looking for.  I'll try to sit Down with him next week.  I'm not planning on doing anything this week.
