Hi

Trying to finish a simple xyplot, but the key colors don't match  
those specified on the plot. I have only been able to change the  
color of the key text, but not the points.


Hours <- c 
(25.88,32.31,24.04,23.27,16.64,19.75,27.25,17.9,20.45,29.65,20.83,27.17, 
28.42,28,18.85,17.4,19.75,25.34,23.23,29.85,28.96,25.6,14.67,20.55,25.77 
, 
23.18,30.37,25.68,24.74,23.57,20.12,15.47,27.63,35,21.88,23.17,26.65,26. 
5,19.64,19.57,26.67,23.03,21.85,28.43,27.11,17.43,24.36,23.88,24.13,31.2 
7,28.82)

DistanceMeters <- c 
(244.77,101.49,188.54,94.76,4.31,34.83,91.76,8.5,1,475.71,337.13,737.32, 
272.06,173.71,5.39,45.39,92.69,304.39,487.79,342.87,396.17,382.04,1,0,26 
9.4,441.37,303.39,330.39,169.89,462.5,84.62,41.24,1,574.75,5.65,61.52,16 
0.99,94.14,103.93,24.38,575.64,4.15,251.73,347.13,5.8,69.92,477.86,465.7 
3,152.09,390.05,205.81)

Surveyor <- as.factor(c 
("K9","Human","K9","Human","Human","Human","K9","Human","Human","K9","K9 
","K9","K9","Human","Human","Human","Human","Human","K9","Human","Human" 
,"K9","Human","Human","K9","Human","Human","Human","Human","Human","K9", 
"K9","K9","Human","Human","K9","K9","K9","Human","Human","Human","Human" 
,"Human","K9","Human","Human","K9","Human","Human","Human","Human"))

library(lattice)


xyplot(DistanceMeters~Hours, groups=Surveyor, xlab="Time (h)",  
ylab="Distace Moved (m)", pch = c(1, 16), col=c("black","black"),  
auto.key=T)

Produces dots correctly, but not the points in the key. Switching to  
simpleKey I have only been able to change the color of the key text,  
but not the points.

xyplot(DistanceMeters~Hours, groups=Surveyor, xlab="Time (h)",  
ylab="Distace Moved (m)", pch = c(1, 16), col=c("black","black"),  
key=simpleKey( points = TRUE, text=c("Human", "Dog"), pch=c(1,16),  
col=c("black","black"), space = "right"))

Can anyone help?


Thanks

Ken
