Latest NFL Player News

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/30/01
Gadsden (hamstring) started Sunday's game against Atlanta. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/30/01
Muhammad (toe) has been deactivated for Sunday's game. Isaac Byrd will start in his place. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/30/01
Walls (knee) has been declared inactive for Sunday's game. Kris Mangum will start in his place. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/30/01
Bouman has been deactivated for Sunday's game. Spergon Wynn will start in his place. 

Dez White <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/30/01
White has been declared inactive for Sunday's game. David Terrell is expected to start in his place. 

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 12/30/01
Stewart has been deactivated for Sunday's game. Lamont Warren will start in his place. 

Mike McMahon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/30/01
McMahon will not play on Sunday. Ty Detmer will start in his place. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/30/01
Bettis has been declared inactive for Sunday's game against the Bengals. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will start in his place. 

Jay Fiedler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=12363&>, QB MIA - Tori Updated 12/29/01
Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore throwing elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is expected to start. If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's matchup vs. the Falcons is a good one. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family illness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Cleveland, but he's expected to start. 

Larry Foster <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Chicago. However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy season. 

Bert Emanuel <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1186&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Emanuel (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy Football season. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/29/01
Muhammad (turf toe) will not play this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his place again. 

Seahawks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=27&>, DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time will likely be limited. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury. Spergon Wynn will start in his place. 

Spergon Wynn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=187690&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season. 

Drew Bledsoe <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1041&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring. 

Martin Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=133297&>, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 12/28/01
Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. 

MarTay Jenkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=133322&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 12/28/01
Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.

Brian Finneran <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=12366&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Tyrone Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1499&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone. 

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/28/01
Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Frank Updated 12/28/01
Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play. 

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 12/28/01
Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week. 

Aaron Shea <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=187642&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out. 

Jason Brookins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/28/01
Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17.

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/28/01
Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload.
