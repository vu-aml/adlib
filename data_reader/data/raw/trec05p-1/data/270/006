How can you sell this software as OEM ?It seems too good to be true - is there a catch?

There is no catch - the software versions that we sell are OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) 
which means you will receive the installation CDs only (they do not come in their original retail
packing and do not include the manual). We do guarantee that all programs are the 100% full working
retail versions - no demos or academic versions! When you order, you will receive all materials
required for a complete installation - or your money back! Why pay hundreds of dollars more when you
can get exactly the same but OEM-CD? You don't have to pay that much for the fancy box and manuals.


Why is your software so inexpensive compared to the other retailers?

We minimize our overhead by stocking mostly top selling software only and try to get the
best deals for them. We also sell what are called OEM versions, the same software as the 
box version without the box and the manual. By foregoing the fancy box and typically slim
manuals you end up saving a considerable amount.

thank you
