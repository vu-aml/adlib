Last week was the hardest week that our office has ever experienced.  When I look down the list of people who were laid off I see the names of some very talented people.  Things have unfolded so quickly -- the reality of the situation is settling in for me, and probably many of us, today.  

Again, I wanted to express my thanks and gratitude to everyone on our floor -- both current and former employees.  In the interest of keeping people informed about who is here and who is gone, below is a complete list of layoffs done last week within the west power team.
