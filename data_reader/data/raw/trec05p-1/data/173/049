Latest NFL Player News

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Watters has placed on injured reserve. He will not play again this season. Shaun Alexander will be the starter for Seattle's final three games. 

Brian Griese <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Matty Updated 12/19/01
Griese should be able to return from a concussion after the bye week. Jarious Jackson will be Denver's No. 2 QB. 

Joe Jurevicius <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=12484&>, WR NYG - Giggles Updated 12/19/01
Jurevicius (hamstring) is expected to return to action on Sunday. He may be able to catch a deep ball or two against the erratic Seattle secondary. 

Travis Henry <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=235216&>, RB BUF - Martin Updated 12/19/01
Henry will miss Sunday's game with a sprained right knee. Shawn Bryson will start in his place. 

Tim Dwight <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=12340&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Dwight (fluid in lung) is not expected to play this week. He has not produced very much this year when healthy.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 12/19/01
Wheatley, who was not used last week, is expected to see some playing time in Week 15. He will probably not be used enough, however, to help most Fantasy teams. 

Derrick Mason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1816&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Mason missed Tuesday's practice with a hip flexor injury. His current status is day to day.

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
McNair (back stiffness) missed practice on Tuesday. His current status is day to day. 

Chris Sanders <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Sanders has returned to practice from a back injury. He is not expected to play this week. 

Tony Richardson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1471&>, RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 12/19/01
Richardson is day to day with a shoulder injury. He is expected to play on Sunday. 

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/19/01
Gadsden missed Tuesday's practice with a strained hamstring. He is expected to play on Saturday.

Bill Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=235069&>, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Gramatica (knee) was placed on injured reserve. Rookie Cedric Oglesby will be Arizona's placekicker for the final three games of the season. 

Amos Zereoue <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Zereoue is listed as questionable this week because of a sore shoulder. He might start at RB if healthy. He replaced Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala and gained 73 yards Sunday. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/19/01
The Pittsburgh Steelers may be without Bettis for at least one more week. Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to play Sunday against Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as doubtful with a groin injury. "But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis) will come back and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's playing in the right games." Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His health status makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will likely start for Bettis.

Skip Hicks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=12436&>, RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Titans Head Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that he plans to give Hicks more work over the final three games of the season, according to the Nashville Tennessean . "We're going to play Skip more," Fisher said. "We're going to play Skip, if at all possible, as much as he played [Sunday] night … But I also want to get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This development will limit George's production over the final three weeks, making him a risky start.

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
McNair will miss Tuesday's practice due to tightness in his lower back which hampered him during Sunday's game against Green Bay. The injury is unrelated to his 1999 surgery to repair a disc in his lower back, and he should return to practice on Wednesday. Provided McNair heals over the next couple of days, he's a safe start for Week 15.

Amos Zereoue <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Zereoue re-injured his sprained shoulder late in Sunday's game against Baltimore. His status for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear, but he's only a marginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.

Gus Frerotte <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1070&>, QB DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on injured reserve due to a separated shoulder which might require surgery. Brian Griese will probably start for the remainder of the season, with Jarious Jackson serving as his backup.

James Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Hunter Updated 12/18/01
According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Jackson could miss the remainder of the season due to a sprained ankle. He wasn't a reliable weekly starter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay and Jamel White, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time the rest of the way if Jackson is out.

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Frank Updated 12/18/01
Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Don't reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based on the Ravens' strong rush defense.

Scott Mitchell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1025&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Mitchell could get the start Sunday against Baltimore due to Jon Kitna's strained ligament in the middle finger of his throwing hand. Whether Mitchell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect either QB to be worth starting in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season.

Akili Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=133415&> , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
The Bengals placed Smith on injured reserve with a hamstring injury Tuesday, officially ending his season. He will likely need surgery to reattach the muscle group in his hamstring to the bone. Jon Kitna will probably start in his place the rest of the season if he's healthy, but we don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the rest of the year anyway.

Terry Allen <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/18/01
The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnati after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10 carries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three after he recovered from a hand injury. N! on! e of the three is a worthy starter in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts. 

Doug Flutie <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 12/18/01
Chargers Head Coach Mike Riley said Monday that he plans to start Flutie Sunday against Kansas City instead of rookie Drew Brees. While Brees is not expected to play, he may see some playing time in the Week 16 finale against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player during the Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility he could sit in favor of Brees at any time.

Priest Holmes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1645&>, RB KC - Russell Updated 12/18/01
Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibly Thursday due to a sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable for Sunday's game against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his status before you consider using him this week.

Bill Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=235069&>, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
According to the Arizona Republic, Gramatica will miss nine months after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament and medial meniscus cartilage in his right knee while celebrating a 42-yard field goal on Saturday against the New York Giants. The Cardinals will audition both Cedrick Oglesby and Vitaly Pisetsky on Tuesday to take Gramatica's place as the team's placekicker. 

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Watters' season has ended with a broken bone in his right ankle. Seattle coach Mike Holmgren said that an MRI test revealed the injury. Holmgren said he will probably put Watters on injured reserve. Watters will decide whether to have an operation on his ankle or let it heal, Holmgren said. The injury puts Shaun Alexander back into the forefront at a crucial time of the year for most Fantasy players. 

Bubba Franks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Franks suffered ankle and tailbone injuries on Sunday. His current status is day to day. 

Curtis Conway <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 12/17/01
Conway injured his shin on Saturday against Oakland. His current status is day to day.

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 12/17/01
George was outplayed by Skip Hicks this week, but head coach Jeff Fisher has indicated there is no RB controversy. Hicks will continue to see some carries at George's expense, though.

Frank Player News

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1681&>, Active RB Updated 12/18/01
Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Don't reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based on the Ravens' strong rush defense.

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1859&>, Reserve WR Updated 12/17/01
Thrash bruised his ribs on Sunday. He is not expected to miss any playing time. 

Garrison Hearst <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1164&>, Active RB Updated 12/16/01
Hearst rushed for 103 yards on 26 carries against Miami on Sunday. He was held out of the end zone, but Hearst is still a good enough player to start during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1236&>, Active WR Updated 12/16/01
Smith had another good outing, catching five passes for 52 yards and a touchdown against Cleveland. The veteran wide receiver is a must-start every week. 

Jake Plummer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1003&>, Reserve QB Updated 12/14/01
Plummer may struggle on the road this week. The Giants may dominate a home matchup with the Cardinals. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1028&>, Active QB Updated 12/14/01
Favre should toss at least two TD passes this week. He will certainly exploit every weakness in the vulnerable Tennessee pass defense. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1593&>, Active WR Updated 12/14/01
Schroeder should post good yardage numbers at Tennessee. The Titans' cornerbacks may have trouble with his speed on post and fly routes. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=188183&>, Reserve RB Updated 12/14/01
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution says Smith's ailing knee has continued to improve, but Bob Christian may get the bulk of the team's carries on Sunday.

Isaac Bruce <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1294&>, Active WR Updated 12/09/01
Bruce caught just three passes for 44 yards against San Francisco. The St. Louis wideout has been a disappointment this year because of his inconsistency, but he is simply too explosive to not remain a starter for any Fantasy team.

Terance Mathis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1189&>, Reserve WR Updated 12/07/01
Mathis continues to do nothing this season for Fantasy owners. Unless you're in a deeper league, holding onto the veteran wide receiver isn't advisable. 

Olandis Gary <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=133291&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/26/01
The Broncos placed Gary on injured reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman to the active roster. This officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursday. Drop him from your roster.

Titans <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=29&>, Active DT Updated 11/06/01
Linebacker Randall Godfrey suffered torn cartilage in his left knee during Sunday's win over Jacksonville. He'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and will be listed as questionable for Monday's game against Baltimore. 

Dorsey Levens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1107&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

David Akers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1666&>, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.
