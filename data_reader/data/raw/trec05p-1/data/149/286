I would recommend that we participate.  In addition to myself we may want Steve V and/or Teb to also attend as they explain their FERC filing for making the backbone system jurisdictional.  Let me know if you concur and then I'll advise Jeff.  Thanks--gh

PG&E called.  They want to set up a conference call to brief us on the gas piece of their POR that they'll be filing with FERC around November 30th.  They want to try to do it in the next couple of weeks. Please let me know if you're interested and please pass this along to anyone else who might be interested.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
