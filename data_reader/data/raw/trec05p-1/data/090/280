ICE charges effective October 2nd (Savita worked this up for me):

Natural gas physical, swaps and options  $.00025 per MMBtu

No charge for one leg of spread trade and no charge for swap when traded as hedge with option.

Firm Power forwards and options  $.005 per MWHr

WTI and Brent for crude swaps $.0025 per barrel and $.0035 per barrel for options  

We are still trying to determine their profitability, etc.  They did come out with total trade counts and volumes for the last year.  We have a call with them next week to introduce Richter to Sprecher and see if there is anything we can do together related to an API or CommodityLogic.

Thanks.
