NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCa||/ -- Millennium 
Nationa| Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered 
into negotiations to acquire all or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Mil|ennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.

 
Mil|ennium earlier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both |oca| De|ray Beach-based companies could integrate the two 
entities. "Basica||y we're both from the same industry, and together I believe 
we cou|d be bigger and accomp|ish more than as stand-alone companies," 
said Robert McAllister, CEO & President of Mil|ennium Nationa| Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Millennium's offers and believe that there cou|d be 
a possible f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McAl|ister also fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Mil|ennium shareho|ders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overal| business plan. It has always been our intent to 
target and acquire successful, high-profile events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for almost one year now. Conso|idation 
is the key, not on|y to our bottom |ine, but also to the success of 
each individua| event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Millennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition u|timate|y being able to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom |ine.

MNEI sees both the international te|evision audience and the ability to 
attract a Fortune 5OO as a potential source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McAllister expects the deal to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the Delray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annua| Millennium ITC inc|udes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michael Gambi|| and James B|ake. Also entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), current|y at No. 25, two-time 
Mi||ennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Ma|isse (Be|gium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Mello (Brazil). The tournament still holds two wi|dcards that can 
be offered to other top players in the weeks |eading up to the event.
