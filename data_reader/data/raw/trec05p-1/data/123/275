Player Updates NFL Reports 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Duce Staley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 11/09/01
Staley could start on Sunday against Minnesota. According to published reports, rookie tailback Correll Buckhalter (shoulder) is still a little banged up, and Staley is the healthier back at this time. 

Edgerrin James <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=133320&>, RB IND - JWillie Updated 11/09/01
James has been downgraded to doubtful for Sunday's game against Miami and Colts Head Coach Jim Mora says he will not play. Don't use James this week, and instead consider u! si! ng Dominic Rhodes, who will start in his place.

Reuben Droughns <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=187528&>, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/09/01
Droughns started last week's game against San Francisco, but he wasn't very productive. He split carries with Lamont Warren in the game, and had ten carries for 36 yards. The same situation will likely hold true this weekend against Tampa Bay, so be sure to avoid any Detroit backs outside of deeper leagues. 

Johnnie Morton <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1223&>, WR DET - Hunter Updated 11/09/01
Morton had a down game against San Francisco last week, and could be in for another tough outing against Tampa Bay. The Bucs have the fourth-ranked defense in the league against the pass, so don't expect big numbers out of Morton this week. 

Lamont Warren <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1112&>, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/09/01
Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Tampa Bay. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues. 

Ahman Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 11/09/01
Green had a huge game against Tampa Bay last week, but don't expect the same type of output against Chicago. His numbers may in fact be down, but Green is too good to bench unless you have a a number of solid tailbacks on your roster. 

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 11/09/01
Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face a Chicago team on Sunday that is a bit vulnerable to the pass, so be sure to start Favre this week. 

Bubba Franks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/09/01
Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in seven games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis. 

Mike Alstott <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1169&>, RB TB - JWillie Updated 11/09/01
Alstott has scored four touchdowns in his last two games, and his success should continue this week against Detroit. Alstott's yardage numbers may not be very good, but he's definitely a good start in points-only leagues. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 11/09/01
Dunn has struggled in recent weeks, but he should have a good outing against Detroit this week. The Lions are ranked 30th in the league against the run, so look for Dunn to come up big for the Buccaneers. 

Brad Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1039&>, QB TB - Matty Updated 11/09/01
Johnson has been putting up decent numbers in recent weeks, and should continue that trend against Detroit. The Lions secondary is vulnerable to the pass, so look for Johnson to have a solid game. 

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 11/09/01
Johnson could be in for a big week against Detroit. The Lions secondary is ranked 25th in the league against the pass, so look for Johnson to shine. He's a must-start in any Fantasy league. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 11/09/01
Culpepper is coming off a bye and should be geared up to play against the Philadelphia Eagles and Donovan McNabb. Culpepper's numbers may not be great against a tough Eagles defense, but he's still far too valuable to ever bench. 

Cris Carter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 11/09/01
Carter has had some b! el! ow-average yardage games this season, but he's still one of the best players in the league when it comes to finding the end zone. For that reason, it's tough to ever put him on your reserve list, even against a tough Philadelphia secondary. 

Byron Chamberlain <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1496&>, TE MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/09/01
Chamberlain has had a few bad outings in recent weeks, and may struggle against Philadelphia's tough linebackers. He has been a solid tight end overall, however, so starting him is still a good move unless you have a better option. 

Randy Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/09/01
Moss is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Philadelphia due to an ankle injury. The Eagles have a solid secondary, but Moss is still worth starting because of his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers. 

Ricky Williams <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=133448&>, RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/09/01
Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face a Niners defense that has been pretty solid against the run, but Williams is still a must-start. 

Joe Horn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 11/09/01
Horn has had four straight solid performances, and is likely to have another against San Francisco. He torched the Niners for 15 catches, 285 yards and a score last season, and is a must-start for Fantasy owners this week.

Willie Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1234&>, WR NO - Martin Updated 11/09/01
Jackson's numbers aren't mind-blowing, but he has been a decent option for Fantasy owners in deeper leagues this season. Unless you have better options on your roster, Jackson is worth starting this week against San Francisco. 

Torry Holt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=133310&>, WR STL - Tori Updated 11/09/01
Holt has been a solid wideout this season, and should continue his success against Carolina on Sunday. Be sure to start him this week. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 11/09/01
Bruce had a huge game before St. Louis' bye week, and he'll likely have another big performance in Week Nine. Look for Bruce to put up 100 yards receiving and a score against the questionable Carolina secondary. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 11/09/01
Faulk (knee) has been practicing all week, and he will start on Sunday against Carolin! a.! He's a must-start against any team, so be sure to put him into your lineup. 

Ernie Conwell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1366&>, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/09/01
Conwell has become a decent option at a position lacking reliable players. Unless you have a better option, Conwell is a good start against Carolina. 

Kurt Warner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 11/09/01
Warner could have a huge game this weekend at the Trans World Dome. He'll be facing a Carolina defense ranked 29th in the league against the pass, so 300-plus yards passing and three touchdowns is a definite possi! bi! lity. 

Richard Huntley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1456&>, RB CAR - Russell Updated 11/09/01
Huntley will start this week against St. Louis, but he's not worth considering as a starter for your Fantasy team. Carolina will likely fall behing early in this game, which will force them to abandon their running game, leaving Huntley very few opportunities to produce. 

Donald Hayes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/09/01
Hayes has been hindered by a foot injury in recent weeks, but is expected to play on Sunday against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting! h! im is somewhat of a gamble. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/09/01
Muhammad has done nothing in four straight weeks, and he could be in for another down game against St. Louis. With Carolina's quarterback situation up in the air and the prospect of facing CB Aeneas Williams looming, Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad this week. 

Ron Dayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/09/01
Dayne has had three straight down weeks, but he'll have a good chance to break out of his slump this week against Arizona. Dayne has two touchdowns in his last two games verus the Cardinals, and may be worth taking a gamble on in larger leagues. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Russell Updated 11/09/01
Hilliard has scored a touchdown in two straight games, and has put up decent numbers over the last four weeks. He's a good start this week, especially against an Arizona defense ranked 22nd in the league against the pass. 

Amani Toomer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 11/09/01
Toomer was benched last week in favor of Joe Jurevicius, but he still had 69 yards receiving against Dallas. He's put up decent numbers against this week's opponent, Arizona, in the past, so starting him is a good move.
