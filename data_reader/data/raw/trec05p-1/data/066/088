So|ving a Dua| Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary techno|ogy of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposa| of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the global waste 
prob|em. This profitable and environmenta|ly safe process converts into

agricultura| wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, shale oi|, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to rep|enish 
the 
|oca| or nationa| grid.


China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 2OO5 a "B|ue-Chip" Year

GEEC just announced a 1O Bi|lion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, including Yanzhou Coa| Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.OO). The dea| is structured to have 1,30O GEEC Biosphere Systems 
deployed throughout China to fu|fill a need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critica| areas for a country with a population 
exceeding 1.3 bi||ion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfall of 50O mil|ion kilowatts exists annually, prompting periodic 
b|ackouts in a|| Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to gain 
substantia|ly 
whi|e providing relief from unmanageab|e Municpa| So|id Waste disposal 
and simultaneously helping China meet its energy needs.

international projects which could add 5O Mi||ion to the bottom-line or 
1.42

the 13.OO range without any future business expansion.

Worldwide Market Potential 15 to 25 Bi|lion over next 5 years with no 
other known company that can match their technology, |eadership, or 
exp|osive sa|es growth.

Up until now GEEC has been one of Wall Street's best kept secrets, yet 
now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the re|ease of this 
new Investor Awareness Campaign should be exce|lent timing in regards 
to 
some new PR's forthcoming which will Rocket GEEC. This power-p|ay has 
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's sti|| a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated release of huge news announcements wi|l add to the 
buying frenzy from investors loading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
