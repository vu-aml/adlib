Hi Folks,

Doing our best to get these to you early in the week as you juggle your
lineups for the stretch run.   Here's how I see the Rushing Game Matchups
this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly
where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive
emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but
listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup
may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start
the player with the best matchup.   Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup
one week but unless you're sitting on Ricky Williams or Marshall Faulk,
Green's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.  (Yes, even after
last week's performance)  The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool
in your box when it comes to deciding between players.

Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.
http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position
numbers are from ESPN.com.   Target numbers are from our Footballguy Andy
Hicks.
Let's get to it.

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Locks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.


Arizona's Michael Pittman vs Carolina Defense

After a few weeks of worrying about Thomas Jones, Michael Pittman seemed to
clearly be the prime RB here last week.   He rushed 14 times for 58 yards
(4.1 ypc) plus a TD.   Thomas Jones, on the other hand, only had 4 carries
for 18 yards.   The Panthers rank # 30 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last four weeks so you have to like his chances again this week.
For the year, Carolina ranks # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Atlanta's Maurice Smith / Rodney Thomas vs Miami Defense

Probably the strongest criticism of Smith you could offer is that he's
losing time to Rodney Thomas...   Smith was ineffective again last week but
did score the cheap TD.   He ran 14 times for 23 yards (1.6 ypc).   Thomas
had 41 yards on 13 carries (3.2 ypc) and did bring a spark.   Smith injured
his toe and even though it's not believed to be serious, it's hard to put
much faith in him with Thomas coming on.   This week, they'll face a Dolphin
defense that's been soft lately ranking # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.   Make sure to understand, I don't have much faith in
either of these guys so check the cheatsheets to see where I rank them.
It's just that the Dolphins have been very weak lately against the run.


Carolina's Richard Huntley vs Arizona Defense

Huntley ran pretty well last week against a tough St. Louis defense so it's
tough to count him out.   He posted 74 yards on 19 carries (3.9 ypc) plus a
score.   This week, he gets a much softer defense in Arizona that Emmitt
Smith ran over last week.   The Cardinals rank # 26 in Rushing Yards Allowed
per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.


Chicago's Anthony Thomas vs Detroit Defense

Thomas put in a very Bearish workmanlike effort last week with 82 yards on
24 carries (3.4 ypc)   Clearly, he's the kind of tough back this team wants
yet he has the skills and speed to be more than just a grinder.   This week,
he'll likely see lots of action against the Lions ranked # 22 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Green Bay's Ahman Green vs Minnesota Defense

Ahman Green bounced back as expected and proved why he's one of the league's
elite backs.   He rolled up 150 yards on 21 carries (7.4 ypc).   He did have
a 43 yarder thrown in there.   He did leave with some breathing problems but
he is expected to be ok this week.   Watch to make sure, though.   This
week, he'll face a Viking team that looks like they've rolled over.   The
Vikings rank # 31 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks
and # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   It doesn't always play out in
real life, but on paper, it doesn't get much better than this.


Miami's Lamar Smith vs Atlanta Defense

Again, Lamar Smith was weak.   12 rushes for 33 yards (2.8 ypc) and a big
fumble.   But the Dolphins don't seem too excited about going with anyone
else so there's always that chance for a cheap TD, sort of like with
Atlanta's Maurice Smith.   I don't have much faith in him but this week,
he'll face the soft Falcon defense that's ranked # 28 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and let the Bills run wild on them
last week.   For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs
so you have to like the matchup.   Check the cheatsheets to see exactly
where we rank him.

New York Jet's Curtis Martin vs Buffalo Defense

Martin put in his typical workhorse effort Sunday with 122 yards on 23
carries (5.3 ypc)   Look for more of the same against the Bills ranked # 23
in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


St. Louis' Marshall Faulk vs Indianapolis Defense

Yawn.   Start Faulk.   He rolled up 202 yards on 30 carries last week (6.7
ypc)   Best player in the game yada yada.   He's the man.   If it matters to
you (and it shouldn't) the Colts rank # 27 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last four weeks and # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.



/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong
lately.


Denver's Terrell Davis vs Oakland Defense

Terrell Davis jumps back in the fray after a week of rest.   Oakland's
defense has improved from awful to just bad over the last few weeks.   They
rank # 24 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For
the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Oakland allowed
Tennessee's Skip Hicks and Eddie George to run for 87 yards last week so
they are getting better.


Jacksonville's Stacey Mack vs Kansas City Defense

We caught a little flak last week for listing Stacey Mack in the lock column
against the Raiders but Mack helped us out with another 100+ yard day.   He
rushed 27 times for 111 yards (4.1 ypc) plus 2 TDs.   Of course, just to
make you Mack owners nervous, Coach Tom Coughlin said this week that Fred
Taylor could see action this week or next...
http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/122501/jag_8179728.html   I
personally don't see it this week but with this season, you never know.
Kansas City ranks # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New Orleans' Ricky Williams vs Washington Defense

Williams owners (like me) groaned when the Saints fell behind so early last
week.   Williams was effectively taken out of the game.   Although
truthfully, he's been less and less a factor lately regardless of the score.
He ran for 26 yards on 10 carries (2.6 ypc) and caught 4 passes for 15
yards.   That's pretty small.   This week, he'll face the Redskins who rank
# 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Tennessee's Eddie George vs Cleveland Defense

As weird as it sounds, Eddie George will get the carries this week by
default as Skip Hicks injured his hamstring and won't see action.   The
Browns rank # 25 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks
and for the year, they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Baltimore's Terry Allen vs Tampa Bay Defense

Allen looked solid last week with 91 yards on 22 carries (4.1 ypc) plus a
score.   He showed little ill effects of being off and actually may have
benefited from the rest.   This week, he'll face a resurging Buc defense
that's ranked # 13 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four
weeks.   That's up from # 21 last week.   For the year, they rank # 10 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Buffalo's Shawn Bryson vs New York Jets Defense

As you know, Bryson went wild last week rushing for 130 yards on 16 carries
(8.1 ypc) plus 2 scores.   He also tacked on 31 yards on 3 receptions.
Bryson did have a 68 yard run which padded the stats a little but they all
count.   Henry will likely sit again giving Bryson another start.   The Jets
rank # 18 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For
the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New York Giant's Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Philadelphia Defense

Neither RB saw much action last week with Barber rushing 12 times for 47
yards (3.9 ypc) and Dayne only rushing 7 times for 42 yards (6.0 ypc) and a
score.   Barber of course, is more active in the passing game.   This week,
they'll face an Eagle defense ranked # 15 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 9 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to RBs.


San Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson vs Seattle Defense

So much for that rookie "wall".   Tomlinson rushed 27 times for 145 yards
(5.4 ypc) last week.   Clearly, he's the primary focus of the offense.   San
Diego has a bye in week 17 (that's not really fair is it?) so this is the
last game.   Drew Brees could see some action which probably means Tomlinson
will be even more the focus if that's possible.   The Seahawks rank # 17 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


San Francisco's Garrison Hearst / Kevan Barlow vs Dallas Defense

Hearst had a solid but not great game last week with 72 yards on 17 carries
(4.2 ypc)   Kevan Barlow carried the ball 6 times for 25 yards (4.2 ypc)
Barlow also caught 3 passes.   He's creeping into Hearst's time.   This
week, they'll face a Cowboy Defense ranked # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.


Tampa Bay's Mike Alstott / Warrick Dunn vs Baltimore Defense

It's tough to predict too much with these guys but Mike Alstott was clearly
the featured RB last week rushing for 101 yards on 24 carries (4.2 ypc) with
a score.   Warrick Dunn had 10 rushes for 32 yards (3.2 ypc) and added 46
yards receiving plus a TD.   This week, they'll face a Baltimore defense
that's bark is worse than it's bite lately.   They rank # 21 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   That just means that lately, they've
given up a lot of yards.   The Tampa backs have been very up and down so be
leery.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong
lately.


Cleveland's Jamel White vs Tennessee Defense

Jamel White prompted lots of "where's he been?" comments from the Brown
faithful last week as he rolled up 131 yards on 21 carries (6.2 ypc)   With
James Jackson out and Ben Gay still too unreliable, it looks like the Browns
will continue to utilize White.   He'll face a tough Defense this week in
Tennessee that ranks # 5 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last
four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Dallas' Emmitt Smith vs San Francisco Defense

Smith is probably happy as he got a chance to pad his stats last week with
128 yards on 26 carries (4.9 ypc)   He ran pretty well after a slow start
and being totally and repeatedly shut down at the goalline.   He's clearly
just an average to below average back at this point in his career.   He does
look like he'll be able to hold off Troy Hambrick though.   The 49ers rank #
3 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Don't discount the
fact Smith is going for another 1,000 yard season.   Of course, with Quincy
Carter at QB, I'd give it to Emmitt too.


Detroit's Lamont Warren / James Stewart vs Chicago Defense

James Stewart re-injured his troublesome ankle last week and Lamont Warren
came in and played well rushing 9 times for 48 yards (5.3 ypc) against a
super tough Pittsburgh team.   (Although he did get 34 of those yards on one
run)   The going isn't much easier this week against the Bears who rank # 9
in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and # 11 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Keep an eye out this week to see whether
Stewart or Warren will play.


Indianapolis' Dominic Rhodes vs St. Louis Defense

Rhodes put together another excellent game last week against the Jets with
126 yards on 17 carries (7.4 ypc) with 1 score.   He also tacked on 26 yards
on 3 receptions.   He did have 2 fumbles though.   This week, he'll face a
tough Ram defense ranked # 8 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last
four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.
Although it should be noted they let Carolina's Richard Huntley run for 74
yards and a TD on them last week so it's not like they're invincible.


Minnesota's Michael Bennett vs Green Bay Defense

Bennett suffered last week from the same problem he's had most of the year.
He just didn't get enough carries to make a difference.   Although one could
argue that after producing just 17 yards on the 11 carries he was given (1.5
ypc), he didn't deserve any more.   Bennett's a percentage guy that'll be
shut down for a while and then eventually break one long.   It's just that
most teams can't afford to wait as long it seems to be taking Bennett to get
going.   This week, he'll face a Packer team ranked # 14 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the season, they rank # 16
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Philadelphia's Duce Staley vs New York Giants Defense

Duce Staley has apparently forgotten how to run the ball lately but it
doesn't matter as he's clearly the Eagles #1 receiver.   Last week, he
rushed 15 times for 35 yards (2.3 ypc)   But he caught 9 passes for 103
yards.   This week, he'll face the Giants who rank # 10 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   More importantly for Staley,
they rank # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
For the year, they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis / Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala vs Cincinnati Defense

Coach Cowher has upgraded Bettis to Questionable for this week and says
he'll play if he's healthy.   Tough to say who'll get the call but one has
to think that if he plays, Bettis will be used just enough to keep him
fresh.   The Steelers are winning without him, have a very beatable opponent
in Cincinnati this week, and don't want to jeopardize their playoff
situation where they know they'll need Bettis.   Plus, the Bengals rush
Defense is tougher than many think.   They rank # 12 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 7 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Seattle's Shaun Alexander vs San Diego Defense

Alexander looked to be making a statement that he should have been the guy
all along with 96 yards on 28 carries (3.4 ypc) and a score plus another 36
yards receiving with a TD.   He'll face the Chargers this week that rank #
11 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Washington's Stephen Davis vs New Orleans Defense

Davis was held pretty much in check against the Bears last week with 57
yards on 22 carries (2.6 ypc)   He did get the score though.   He's clearly
the prime weapon here.   How much would YOU depend on Tony Banks?   This
week, he faces a Saints defense that's been tough lately ranking # 4 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong
lately.


Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Pittsburgh Defense

Dillon ran well against the overhyped Raven rush defense.   As the numbers
showed in the week 15 matchup info, Baltimore's been nothing special against
the run lately.   They were ranked # 12 last week for Dillon and this week,
they rank # 21 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.
Sometimes the numbers tell you more than the reputation.   This week though,
the Steelers rep is backed up with the numbers.   Pittsburgh ranks # 2 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   This is a MUCH tougher
matchup than last week against the Ravens.


Kansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson vs Jacksonville Defense

Holmes had a on "off" day for him with "only" 80 yards on 23 carries (3.5)
and 12 yards receiving.   He'll be fine.   Tony Richardson stole another
cheap TD.   Richardson's a gamble as he won't likely get many yards even on
a good day but he's a threat for a short TD.   The Jaguars have been tough
lately ranking # 1 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I'd
still consider Holmes a must start in most leagues, but this is a tough
matchup.

Oakland's Charlie Garner / Tyrone Wheatley / Zack Crockett vs Denver Defense

Charlie Garner ran well when he ran but as has often been the case lately,
he didn't run enough.  He had 54 yards on just 10 carries (5.4 ypc)   And
most of those were between the 20's.   Zack Crockett and Tyrone Wheatley
both saw action making it nearly impossible to pick which one will do
anything.   The Broncos rank # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs so it'll be a touch matchup.
