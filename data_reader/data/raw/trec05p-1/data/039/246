Thanks for your nice note!  I'm going to miss you!  Let's keep in touch even if it's a quick visit here and there during the holidays or summers.  My mom still asks how you are doing - she's so proud of you!  Take care and don't forget me!

Thanks for the advice.  I hate to hear that you are leaving but I'm sure this is for the best.  Thank you for everything that you have done for me and my family.  I feel like I have such a long way to go but I know that if it wasn't for the favor of God and you and your moms faith in me I wouldn't be where I am today.   I wish you well and I hope you will keep in touch.  Thank you again.

If you have a job - my suggestion is to stay put.  There are hundreds of people in redeployment right now.  It is very hard to find a job.  I don't know if you've heard, but I'm leaving on September 15th.  Ken is leaving Enron and I'm going to stay home with Drake - I'm going to be poor, but that's ok!

Good Morning -

Hope your are doing well in all this rainy weather.  I wanted to ask you a question and your opinion of the odds of me being placed if I go into the redeployment program?  I got my review back and it is much better than it has been in a long time.  I guess I am just concerned that if I don't make a move now, year end might not be as favorable for me.  Rumor has it that the other clerk that I work with has found another job and will be leaving on the 14th of Sept.  I have been caught in such a vicious cycle so long that I just don't know what else to do.  If you have time call me or email me.  I just want to know what you think.
