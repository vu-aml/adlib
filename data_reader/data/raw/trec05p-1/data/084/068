Latest NFL Player News

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/16/01
Hasselbeck is scheduled to start the Seahawks' next game October 28 against
Miami due to a groin injury suffered by Trent Dilfer on Sunday. "Matt has
had a couple of weeks to watch. He's champing at the bit to prove whatever
he has to prove," Head Coach Mike Holmgren told the <I>Seattle
Post-Intelligencer</I>. We don't recommend Hasselbeck as a Fantasy starter
right now, especially against the Dolphins' defense in Week Seven.

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/16/01
Dilfer suffered a pulled groin during Sunday's game against Denver, and he
is not expected to be able to play October 28 against Miami, according to
the <I>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</I>. "There's more to it than just a
normal groin pull. We'll just leave it at that," Seahawks Head Coach Mike
Holmgren said Monday. "He's injured, and he won't practice this week."
Dilfer is probably the better Fantasy option of the two, but don't expect
him to be able to help your team for the next two weeks.

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chance Richardson
could play Sunday in Arizona, according to the <I>Kansas City Star</I>.
Richardson is battling a shoulder injury.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/16/01
Wheatley had an MRI exam on Monday to determine the extent of the damage he
sustained to his right knee Sunday in Indianapolis. The results were
expected back Tuesday.

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/16/01
Smith was in a walking boot after suffering a sprained ankle during
Sunday's game against the Jets, according to the <I>Miami Herald</I>. He
should be fine for Week Seven when the Dolphins return from the bye week.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/16/01
The Broncos are unsure whether Griese will be ready for Sunday's game in
San Diego, according to the <I>Denver Post</I>. However, An MRI Monday
morning on his right shoulder revealed no structural damage and no tie to
his previous shoulder surgeries. Griese is questionable for Wednesday's
practice as well as Sunday's game, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte to
get the start.

Rob Johnson, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville
despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all
year, and there's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't
use Johnson.

Jamal Anderson, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Anderson underwent successful surgery to repair the torn ACL in his left
knee Tuesday. Anderson has already been placed on injured reserve and is
out for the remainder of the 2001 season. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/16/01
Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday's game against the New York Jets
despite a bruised right knee. "He really could possibly play this week,"
coach Mike Martz said. "We're not going to rule the possibility of him
playing completely out." If Faulk is unable to go, however, Trung Canidate
will be the featured back in the game. At this point, it's tough to make a
decision on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the
situation throughout the week. 

Justin McCareins, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
McCareins will be sidelined six to eight weeks after breaking his ankle
Sunday on a kickoff return. He is scheduled to have surgery on the ankle
Wednesday to insert a pin in the joint. This is a major setback for the
rookie. He started Sunday's game and had two catches for 70 yards. 

Eddie Berlin, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Berlin, a rookie receiver used mostly on special teams, will be sidelined
three to four weeks. He suffered a severely separated right shoulder on a
kickoff return Sunday.

Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Browns' head coach Butch Davis told <i>The Akron Plain-Dealer</i> that
Northcutt will get a lot of playing time this week against the Ravens.
Don't expect Northcutt to be too productive, but he is a decent pickup if
you need an extra wideout this week. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Warrick is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is
recovering from a bruised left shoulder.

Marco Battaglia, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Battaglia is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is
suffering from a strained left shoulder. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
Grbac was feeling woozy and nursing a headache Monday, the result of the
most severe concussion he's received in nine years in the NFL but he will
play Sunday at Cleveland. Grbac was slammed to the ground by Santana Dotson
in the second quarter of the Baltimore Ravens' 31-23 loss to the Green Bay
Packers on Sunday. The quarterback stayed in the game, but threw
interceptions on his next two drives and was pulled eight minutes into the
fourth quarter. On Monday, Grbac declared himself fit enough to play. "I'm
still a little foggy, and my wife was waking me up every few hours to see
if I was alive," he said, "but I'm feeling OK and I'll be ready." 

 Redskins, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Washington cornerback Fred Smoot suffered a sprained left knee during
Monday's game against Dallas. He was on crutches after sustaining the
injury and is currently listed as day-to-day. 

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Alexander suffered a sprained right ankle during Monday night's loss to
Washington. He was seen using crutches on the sidelines and is listed as
day-to-day. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/16/01
According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback
on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to
split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him
Fantasy-wsie. 

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/16/01
Jurevicius suffered a rib injury during Sunday's game against St. Louis.
The injury is not considered serious, however, so expect Jurevicius to be
in the starting lineup on Monday against Philadelphia. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/16/01
Schroeder (ankle) informed Head Coach Mike Sherman that he would be
available for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Sherman stated that a
decision on Schroeder would not be made until later in the week, but we
expect him to go. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Galloway suffered a sprained left ankle during Monday night's 9-7 win over
Washington. The Cowboys have a bye this week, so Galloway should have amble
time to recover from the injury in time for the team's next game. 

Reggie Swinton, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Swinton suffered a hamstring injury during pre-game warmups on Monday
night. He left the game after the opening kickoff, and is listed as
day-to-day. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Harris (groin) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He
didn't have a reception in the game, and has no real value as a Fantasy
player at this point. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Carter underwent successful surgery to repair the tendon that attaches his
hamstring to his lower left leg on Monday. He is expected to miss six weeks
of action due to the procedure. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Ismail (knee) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He
finished with three catches for 50 yards, but didn't make much of an impact
Fantasy-wise. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring
any setbacks, Barber will be available for Sunday's game against
Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a
drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Pittman suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, and was
dealing with headaches on Monday as a result. He is expected to undergo
tests, and is status for Sunday's game against Kansas City will be
determined later in the week. If he is unable to play, Thomas Jones would
step into the No. 1 RB role once again. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Moss is dealing with a sprained right ankle, which may keep him from
playing at full capacity this weekend against Green Bay. It's tough to ever
bench Moss, but considering his recent struggles, it might not be a bad
idea if your roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Doug Chapman, RB MIN - Team Dick Updated 10/16/01
Chapman is expected to get the starting nod this weekend against Green Bay
due to Michael Bennett's ankle injury. Chapman may be worth picking up for
the week in deeper leagues, but he'll be hard-pressed to put up good
numbers against a solid Packers' defense. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
According to the <I>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</I>, Bennett (ankle) is
expected to miss this weekend's game against Green Bay. He was wearing a
protective boot on Monday and was walking with a noticeable limp. Doug
Chapman will likely get the start in Bennett's absence. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/16/01
Muhammad suffered a hip injury during Sunday's loss to the New Orleans
Saints. However, the injury won't keep him from playing in this weekend's
game against Washington. Considering the Redskins' woes, it's a good idea
to start Muhammad Fantasy-wise. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
Weinke is dealing with a slight thigh injury, but he is expected to play on
Sunday against Washington. With the state of the Redskins team, Weinke may
be worth starting Fantasy-wise. 

Herman Moore, WR DET - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/15/01
Moore suffered a hip pointed during the second quarter of Sunday's game. It
was his only play of the game, which demonstrates how little his Fantasy
value is these days. He is listed as day-to-day. 

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
The Bears plan to re-sign Matthews possibly on Monday, according to the
<I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>. He would return to his backup QB job, and isn't
worth adding to your Fantasy roster.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/15/01
Mike Holmgren has confirmed Trent Dilfer will return to the bench when
Seattle plays its next game. Hasselbeck is expected to start against Miami
on Oct. 28. "The plan is still to prepare for Miami with Matt as the guy,"
Holmgren said. Neither player has been a very useful Fantasy starter so
far, but Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment, while Dilfer has played
mistake-free football.

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 10/15/01
Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches. He is expected to play in
Week Six.

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/15/01
Smith sprained his right ankle on Sunday against the Jets. The injury is
not considered to be serious, and Smith was able to finish the game.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/15/01
Griese re-aggravated a shoulder injury on Sunday at Seattle. The <i>Denver
Post</i> says Griese's shoulder will be re-examined on Monday or Tuesday.
"I was able to come back and play this week, and I'm hoping to do the same
next week," Griese said.

Chad Johnson, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
Johnson is expected to miss six weeks with a fractured collarbone. He
injured the shoulder in the third quarter of Sunday's game.Ron Dugans might
now become Cincinanti's third receiver. 

Terry Jackson, RB SF - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
Jackson suffered a calf injury Sunday. He is listed as probable for next
week's game at Chicago. 

Rob Johnson, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
The <i>Buffalo News</i> says Johnson (neck) looked good in practice on
Sunday. He is expected to play in Week Six. ""He threw the ball extremely
well, especially in the wind today," said coach Gregg Williams. "He had a
fresh arm. It seems like there is no residual effect from it right now." 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/15/01
A hip injury prevented Muhammad from finishing Sunday's game. He is
expected to play in next week's game against the Redskins. 

Terance Mathis, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/15/01
Mathis shook off a hip injury and played in Sunday's game. However, a
sprained hand limited him to four catches for 50 yards. The hand injury
isn't considered to be serious. Mathis will be evaluated on a day-to-day
basis. 

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
Christian suffered bruised ribs in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a
day to day basis. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
Jefferson missed a lot of playing time Sunday because of a sprained left
big toe. He will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/15/01
The St. Louis Rams will be without Faulk for at least one week. The Rams
originally diagnosed the injury as a sprained right medial collateral
ligament, but an MRI revealed no severe ligament or cartilage damage. Rams
coach Mike Martz fears that Faulk may be sidelined for at least three
weeks. "They (the doctors) think he will be out somewhere between three to
four weeks," Martz said. Faulk will be re-evaluated next week and believes
it is possible he could return for a key NFC West game against the New
Orleans Saints on October 28. "We'll see," Faulk said. "It's kind of early
to say, but you never know." 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/15/01
Weinke continued to struggle Sunday, fumbling away the center exchange on
Carolina's second possession, losing another fumble when his arm was hit as
he attempted to pass and also throwing an interception. All three turnovers
led to Saints scores, putting Carolina down 17-0. He finished 21-of-39 for
196 yards and two second-half touchdowns. Use him as a reserve for now. 

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Dilfer left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with a groin injury. He was
replaced by Matt Hasselbeck.

Eddie Kennison, WR DEN - Dont Mess Updated 10/14/01
Kennison caught six passes for 84 yards and a TD at Seattle. Don't expect
Kennison to suddenly turn his career and season around with one solid
outing. He might follow his good game with many weeks of statistical
silence,

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Alexander had another great game, rushing for 142 yards and two TDs on 33
carries against Denver. Alexander has clearly established himself as a
Fantasy standout, and he has ignited the Seattle offense. If he continues
to play at his current level, he might hold onto the feature back job, even
when Ricky Watters returns.

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Fiedler threw for 213 yards and a score against the N.Y. Jets, but he was
also picked off twice. He's still not a very reliable Fantasy player, and
is no better than a reserve at this point. 

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Smith had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 77 yards of total offense and
a touchdown against the N.Y. Jets. He did fumble twice in the game, but
he's still good enough to be a No. 1 back from a Fantasy perspective. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Coles was very prodcutive for the N.Y. Jets on Sunday, posting five catches
for 77 yards and two touchdowns against Miami. He may not be worth starting
every week just yet, but Coles is slowly becoming a player worthy of a
roster spot. 

Vinny Testaverde, QB NYJ - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Testaverde had a good outing against Miami, throwing for 168 yards and two
touchdowns. He's still not worth starting ever week, but Testaverde is very
useful Fantasy-wise when the matchup is right. 

Glyn Milburn, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Milburn left Sunday's game against Arizona due to an ankle injury. He will
be re-evaluated on Monday. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Bennett did nothing yet again, posting only 46 yards rushing against
Detroit. Unless you play in a deeper league, you may want to consider
dropping Bennett altogether. 

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, catching nine passes for 125
yards and a score. He's still not consistent enough to use every week at
this point, but he's easily worth a roster spot if available. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Batch had a huge game against Minnesota, throwing for 345 yards and three
scores. He's still not worth starting on a weekly basis despite the
performance, but he might now warrant a reserve role in deeper leagues. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Franks caught only two passes for four yards against the Ravens, but both
catches resulted in TDs. Franks has clearly emerged as a primary goal-line
threat on one of the NFL's top offensive units.

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Patten had a good game against San Diego, catching seven passes for 73
yards. He'll likely be pushed out of the starting lineup now that Terry
Glenn is back, so don't be surrpised to see his numbers decrease somewhat. 

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD against Baltimore. His fine
numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clear signal that Freeman is
still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet start prior to this
week.

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Taylor caught three passes for 50 yards and a TD at Green Bay. The
second-year wideout seems to have finally found his niche in the Baltimore
passing game.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Glenn had a huge game in his return from a suspension, catching seven
passes for 110 yards and a score. He won't post numbers that good on a
weekly basis, but he is worth picking up and starting if you need help with
your receivers. 

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Brookins rushed for 33 yards and a TD against Green Bay. The young, strong
back might continue to emerge in Baltimore's offense as the season wears
on.

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Brown had a great outing against San Diego, posting 11 catches for 117
yards against San Diego. With Terry Glenn returning, Brown could become a
pretty relaible Fantasy player facing No. 2 cornerbacks on a weekly basis. 

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Scott caught only one pass for five yards against the Browns, but he scored
on his only reception. Jon Kitna seems to favor Scott in the passing game,
even though the final numbers haven't always reflected it.

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
Conway had a solid game, posting four catches for 117 yards against New
England. He is slowly becoming Doug Flutie's favorite target, and is
becoming a much more reliable Fantasy player than in years past. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Smith rushed for only 36 yards in Sunday's win over San Diego, but he did
score a touchdown. He's still not a complete Fantasy player, however, and
is no better than a reserve used only when the matchup is right. 

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Johnson caught eight passes for 153 yards and a TD against the Bengals. It
appears the Cleveland wideout is starting to re-emerge as a quality Fantasy
player.

Tom Brady, QB NE - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Brady had his first impressive outing on Sunday, throwing for 364 yards and
two touchdowns in the Patriots' 29-26 overtime win over San Diego. Despite
the great performace, Brady is still not worth anything more than a reserve
spot Fantasy-wise. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Jackson played against Cincinnati, but was limited to only 22 rushing yards
on 14 carries. The rookie running back, who played despite some rib
problems, has been inconsistent and unreliable so far.

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Tomlinson's yardage numbers (87 total) were subpar by his standards, but he
did score another touchdown for San Diego. He's one of the top tailbacks in
the league and should be a weekly starter Fantasy-wise. 

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Flutie had a solid game on Sunday, posting 270 yards passing and a
touchdown against New England. He's still not worth starting every week,
but is better of used when the matchup is right. 

Justin McCareins, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
McCareins started in place of the injured Derrick Mason on Sunday against
Tampa Bay. He did have two catches for 70 yards in the game, but still
warrants very little Fantasy consideration. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
Hayes caught seven passes for 44 yards against the Saints. If opponents
continue to pay extra attention to Muhsin Muhammad, Hayes might continue to
post some respectable numbers.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
George had his best Fantasy game of the season, posting 132 yards of total
offense and a score against Tampa Bay. The performance brings a sigh of
relief from Fantasy owners worried that George had lost a step after
offseason toe surgery. 

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Huntley rushed for only two yards on four carries against New Orleans. The
Panthers are still searching for a quality runner, but Huntley doesn't
appear capable of filling their void at RB.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
McNair finally had a productive game Fantasy-wise, compiling 284 yards of
total offense and two touchdowns against Tampa Bay. He's still not a
reliable weekly option Fantasy-wise, so use him only if the matchup is
right. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Muhammad caught only two passes for eight yards against he Saints. Don't
expect such poor numbers from Muhammad very often. He remains a quality
Fantasy wideout.

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Green was solid on Sunday, catching six passes for 72 yards and a score
against Tennessee. Despite his good performance, Green is still not a
reliable player from a Fantasy perspective. 

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
Cleeland overcame a hamstring problem to play against Carolina, and he
caught two TD passes. The injury-prone tight end finished with three
catches for 38 yards, but he remains a Fantasy risk because he simply can't
seem to stay healthy for very long.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Johnson had his best game of the season, posting eight catches for 140
yards against Tennessee. He's a top-notch wideout Fantasy-wise, and
deserves a weekly spot in your starting lineup. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/14/01
Smith rushed for 50 yards and a TD against the 49ers. Smith's yardage
numbers won't be overwhelming the rest of the year, but he should continue
to be a consistent TD threat.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Dunn (foot) was used as the Bucs' featured back on Sunday against
Tennessee. He posted 81 yards of total offense and two scores in Tampa
Bay's 31-28 overtime win. 

Tai Streets, WR SF - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Streets caught four passes for 51 yards against Atlanta. With J.J. Stokes
continuing to wallow in mediocrity, Streets has a chance to step up and
take a more prominent role in the San Francisco offense.

Brad Johnson, QB TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Johnson finally had a productive game Fantasy-wise, throwing for 287 yards
and three scores against Tennessee. He is still not worth starting on a
regular basis, however, and is better off used when the matchup is good. 

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Robinson struggled on Sunday, catching only two passes for six yards. He
had been dealing with a sore lower back, which may have had something to do
with his performance in the game. 

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Thomas had 11 carries for 58 yards in Sunday's game against Arizona. Thomas
is inching closer to taking James Allen's starting job, and is worth
stashing away on your roster if available. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 10/14/01
Owens had a super outing against Atlanta, catching nine passes for 183
yards and three TDs, including the game-winner, a 52-yarder in overtime.
Owens is definitely maintaining his place among Fantasy Football's best
receivers.

James Allen, RB CHI - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Allen had a solid game on Sunday, rushing for 75 yards and a touchdown.
However, the performance is a bit tainted Fantasy-wise since it was against
a weak Arizona defensive front. Don't expect thos type of numbers from the
Bears' tailback on a weekly basis. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Surprisingly, Miller had a tough day against a shaky Arizona defense on
Sunday. The Bears' QB threw for only 116 yards and was picked off twice in
Chicago's 21-13 victory. Miller is still worth a roster spot, but he's no
better than a backup Fantasy-wise.

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
Canidate replaced the injured Marshall Faulk late in Sunday's game against
the N.Y. Giants. If Faulk's knee injury is serious, be sure to put in a
waivers request for Canidate as soon as possible. 

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Minnis caught one pass for only 14 yards against the Steelers. The rookie
has been inconsistent so far, and is a risky start unless he faces a
below-average defense.

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
Hilliard, who was dealing with a slight oblique strain, played on Sunday
against St. Louis. He caught three passes for 49 yards and a score in New
York's 15-14 loss. 

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Alexander overcame back problems to play against the Steelers, but was held
to just one catch for 10 yards. Injuries and lack of effective complements
have rendered Alexander a disappointment so far this season.

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Jurevicius posted a solid game against St. Louis, catching six passes for
101 yards. If he continues to put up good numbers, Jurevicius could keep
Ike Hilliard from getting back his starting role. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Holmes rushed for 150 yards and two TDs against Pittsburgh. Such good
numbers against the Steelers prove Holmes has arrived as a quality Fantasy
player.

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Dayne started on Sunday against St. Louis despite a neck injury. He rushed
for 88 yards and a score in New York's 15-14 loss, and may be solidifying
his grasp on the featured back role for the G-Men. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Collins completed 18-of-32 passes for 250 yards and a touchdown on Sunday
against St. Louis. However, he's still not a reliable starter Fantasy-wise
despite his decent numbers against the Rams. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/14/01
Ward had another solid outing. While he caught four passes for only 38
yards, he did catch a five-yard TD pass, once again proving he is the only
reliable wideout on the Pittsburgh roster,
