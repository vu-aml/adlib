Thanks for reserving tickets to the October 17 Presidential speech at
the Sacramento Memorial Auditorium.  We are now in possession of the
tickets and must ask you to pick them up as soon as possible, either
Monday or Tuesday at our offices, 980 Ninth Street, Suite 2200 from 8
a.m. to 5 p.m.

In the event you wish to have the tickets delivered to you overnight by
Federal Express or other major carrier, please call Geri Royer and give
her an account number to which they may be charged, no later than 3 p.m.
Monday, for delivery Tuesday.

As a last resort, we have reserved a room at the Sacramento Convention
Center for October 17, 2001 where the last remaining unclaimed tickets
will be held from 7:30 a.m. until 9 a.m., however it is recommended that
you claim your tickets as quickly as possible to ensure your seating.

We are also attaching a sheet of instructions, which you should read
carefully and retain for the day of the event.  Also there is a map of
downtown Sacramento with parking garages marked, if you should need it.

Thanks for your interest and we look forward to seeing you all at this
historic event.
