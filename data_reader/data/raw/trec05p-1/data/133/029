Mr.Williams  Jomo
AMALGAMATED BANK OF
SOUTH AFRICA.


                                   TRANSFER OF FUND FOR INVESTMENT.

Dear Sir ,

Good day, my name is Mr.Williams Jomo,the CHIEF AUDITOR OF AMALGAMATED BANK 
OF SOUTH AFRICA, there is an account opened in this bank in 1980  and since 
1990 nobody has operated on this account again. After goingthrough some 
files in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money  out 
urgently it would be forfeited.

The owner of this account is mr.B.Andreas,a foreigner and a Miner at Kruger 
Gold Company. A geologist by profession who died in 1990.No one knows about 
this account or anything concerning it,the account has no other  beneficiary 
and the investigation proves to me as well that his company does not know 
anything about this account and the amount in this account at the moment is 
US$35.5 M(Thirty five million five hundred thousand UNITED STATES DOLLARS 
ONLY)As the money is in United states dollars I need a foreigner 
partner/Account to transfer the money overseas thus I am contacting 
you.please  kindly indicate and if so contact me on the above phone to 
enable me inform you on the next step totake.

I need your full co-operation to make this transaction work because the 
management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct 
information on this account,which I myself will give you if you indicate 
your interest. I hope you can be able to handle such amount in strict 
confidential because this opportunity will never come again in my 
life.Noted: I have decided to retire from the government services to private 
business, I need your truthful person in this business relationship because 
I don’t want to make any mistake .I Need your strong assurance and 
confidentiality.

With my position now in the office I can transfer this money to any reliable 
foreign account ,with assurance that this money will be intact pending my 
physical arrival in your country for sharing.
All documents regarding this transaction will be destroyed once I receive 
confirmation of  the money in your account thus leaving no trace to 
anything.

I wiil apply for annual leave to get visa immediately on confirmation to 
receive this funds into your designated account with appropriate clearance 
forms from the Ministries and Foreign Exchange
Department.At conclusion of this business you will be given 25%of the total 
amount,70% will be for me,while 5% will be for any expenses that we might 
incur during the course of this transaction.

Kindly reply me through my email and indicate your interest.

BEST REGARDS
Mr.Williams Jomo.
