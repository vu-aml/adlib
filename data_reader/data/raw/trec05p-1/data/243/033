Rick,

The l/c is still in effect. Based on the language of the l/c, in order to
terminate the l/c, JPMorgan Chase would have had to notify Lone Star Gas if
its intent to not renew at least 30 days prior to the maturity date. Given
that such notice was not provided, the maturity date was automatically
extended for 12 months. The l/c is currently scheduled to expire on Jan 11,
2003, and continues to be governed by the "evergreen" feature.

Rob

Hi Rob:

I'm hoping you can help with this.  Lone Star is asking to verify that the
LC required under the gas transportation agreement between Lone Star Gas
Co. and Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, Ltd. is presently in effect per the
terms of that agreement.  Jeff Smirin at TXU is looking at the document you
sent to me earlier today.  He would like verification (which I think needs
to come from you) that there has been no termination and that LC#770769 is
effective through 1/11/03.

Please confirm these facts by responding to this e-mail with a Cc: to
jeffsmirin@txu.com.

Thanks,

Rick Hill
Enron North America Corp.
