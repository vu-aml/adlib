IV. TRAVEL COLUMNS

12. THE MYTH OF LOWER--AND HIGHER--AIRFARES
    by Christopher Elliott

In the past several days, a number of would-be air travelers have
complained that airfares were on the upswing since terrorists felled
the World Trade Center towers and decimated the Pentagon. Truth is,
fares are likely to ease this month. But don't take my word for it.

13. ASK ANITA: REDEEMING MILES ON AN AIRLINE THAT MAY GO BANKRUPT?
    by Anita Dunham-Potter, Contributing Travel Editor
   
Dear Anita,

I recently redeemed 70,000 frequent flier miles for two airline
tickets to Hawaii for next April. What happens if the airline I'm
supposed to fly on goes bankrupt? 

- Donna R., Columbia, SC

14. DISASTER AFTERMATH: WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE LONGER TERM 
    by Ed Perkins

By now, you've heard the TV pundits' orotund pronouncements and read
the purple prose: Following the disasters of September 11, air travel
in the U.S. will permanently change. And they're probably right.

15. WHEN PICKING OUT SOUVENIRS, CONSIDER THE ORDINARY THINGS
    by Eoin O'Carroll

If the purpose of a souvenir is to serve as a token of remembrance of
a particular place, it's the ordinary things, not the touristy garbage,


that really count. By taking a few of these bits and pieces with you,
you might also take with you some happy memories.
