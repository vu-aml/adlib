Where’s the opportunity for your company with the evolution of
pervasive computing? Who are the leading private company
contenders in this space? How are they managing the downturn,
and which ones look to have legs? What’s unique about their
technology and how does their value proposition sit with their
market? On December the 4 & 5, I hope you can join us to have
those questions answered. As a forum for assessing potential
clients it’ll be second-to- none. If you are still planning to
join the other leading investors and key executives, please be
sure to register at
https://secure.technologicpartners.com/pcoregister.asp today. A
key fact about the strong crop of private companies presenting
this year is that they’re the sorts of companies who helped
build the Valley in the first place, from the chipsets to the
applications that are making the vision of pervasive computing
increasingly a reality. Whether you call it pervasive, proactive
or ubiquitous computing, the best private companies that are
innovating this space will be there. Some seek partnerships now,
some later. Either way, if it’s new client opportunities you’re
looking for, the San Francisco Airport Marriott on December 4 &
5 is where you’ll find the key people building pervasive
technology companies. Take a moment to review the agenda and
companies slated to present at
http://www.pervasivecomputingoutlook.com


Building contacts with the people that matter


In this environment, establishing and building contacts in
technology sectors is still vital. As a VentureWire subscriber,
you also know that the value of the private company data and
information reported daily is unique. Pervasive Computing
Outlook provides the forum to bridge the gap – allowing you to
make contact with the people that matter. VentureWire's data,
together with in-depth analysis and evaluation, have, I think,
ensured we've assembled a great list of CEOs who are building
companies which sell the technologies and services that will
deliver businesses and consumers the secure means to realize the
benefits of anytime, anywhere connectivity. They will be there
to tell us their stories and their plans for their companies.
There are some very interesting opportunities to be explored.
We've worked hard to collect the best out there for your review.
I hope you’ll agree. To find the companies together with their
links, goto http://www.pervasivecomputingoutlook.com/mmlist.asp




True business momentum? Proven leadership teams?


When you review the companies, you'll find they each demonstrate
specific qualities that suggest they have the best opportunity
to execute strongly. Whether it's WhereNet, whose President &
CEO, Dan Doles co-founded Red Pepper in 1993, and very recently
added Jaguar, Land Rover and Auto Alliance International, (a
Ford/Mazda joint venture) to their client list, or Matrix
Semiconductor, who have someone of the caliber of Dennis Segers
as their CEO since September, (following 2 years on their
board), we look for each participating company to exhibit true
business momentum. The goal is to cut to the chase and offer you
the most time-effective opportunity to talk to and review
worthwhile candidates.
