Subject:	Report on today's ERCOT Wind Meeting


Coalition Members & Turbine Manufacturers:


ERCOT is spearheading an effort to develop a Wind Generation Model to
be used in the PTI transmission software package that is used in many
parts of the world.

ERCOT wants all wind turbine manufacturers & wind developers to get
very involved in this effort.


Wind Pays for Model Development
********************************

ERCOT's willingness to pay the $200,000 software development cost is
scant.... this burden is going to be imposed upon the wind companies.
ERCOT might be willing to serve as a banker to spread charges among
the wind people.

If we delay doing this, there's a possibility that NERC could fine
ERCOT who would in turn pass fines on to Wind Companies.  More
importantly though, without the model, there will be more wind
curtailments in Texas than otherwise necessary.

It will probably take at least a year from now before this model is
available for use.

The need for a good wind turbine generator model is a
National/International issue.  As such, perhaps DOE/NREL will help
pay.

This issue will start cropping up everywhere... ERCOT wants to be a
technical leader and just get it done now.


Wind Turbine Manufacturers
***************************

Hello Vestas, Bonus, Micon, Enron, etc.... ERCOT expects your active
involvement in this Wind Generation Model development effort.

They have a big hammer to use, too.... if your category of wind
machine is not "model-able" in the PTI package, it's possible your
turbines will not be allowed to interconnect in Texas.

What ERCOT wants is:

	(1) control block diagram modeling your machines

	(2)  possibility of adapting your existing models (if you
have one) for use in the PTI package

	(3) possibly $$$ contribution for model development

Please make an effort to participate in next Tuesday's Coalition
Meeting (9/25) from 3:00 - 5:00 pm CST.  Call in # is  916-442-0272.


Sneak-Peak on Transmission Plans
*********************************

ERCOT's annnual transmission report will be filed w/ PUC by Oct.1.
Ken Donohoo will distribute extracts to us via email over the next
week or 2 that are expected to contain the following:

	updated AEP plan

	TXU plan

	New Line recommendation from San Angelo to Rio Pecos

Expect TXU's schedule to also be slower than we originally expected.

Beth inquired about how TSP plans become public & Ken reported that
those standards are still being worked out.
