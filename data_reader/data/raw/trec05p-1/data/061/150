I would add "dispute resolution" to the list.  

I left off in my reading just after the Battle of Bull Run (mid-July, 1861). . .so I have a few months of catching up to do. . . but I will be reading along.  I will try to get current next weekend.

Now that Lincoln has fired Gen. McDowell, I am eager to read about the Lincoln-McClellan relationship.

Hey friends, we are rapidly approaching October, and in our communal reading of Shelby Foote, October is where things pick up and go steadily forward for three years.  Let's dust off the big tome and read forward, month by month together.  Elizabeth,  try not to read too much at a time,  just find where he is in October of 1861 and read slowly.  This is a slow, savoring thing, not a rapid read for escape and entertainment.  With this big terrorist mess going on and eveything, the lessons for both business and life are going to be termendous. And, one final admonition, Elizabeth, when you get into his lengthy descriptions of troop maneuverings,  try not to be bored,  just take a pencil and paper and kind of sketch out what you think he is saying,  the basic directions and movements...use your skills for calculating early termination payments and set offs.  All of these battles are big netting and set off messes.  You are better qualified than you think to get into this stuff.  War is just a big messy chess game termination and  set off.  Try to get your imagination into it this way.   ----cgy

And, if duty calls, he would understand. . . .

There were those times, during the War, when fighters on one side of the line would gain personal knowledge of the presence of old friends, even relatives, being directly across the lines, back there in the mass of enemey troops.  The Union General Hancock had been a very close friend of the Confederate General Armsted and on the eve of the final day at Gettysburg,  had a moment or two remembering their good old days together in California.  Wolfe and Krebs are out there somewhere "on the other side."  Although I must candidly confess that officer Krebs does not rank high in my humble judgement and is not among the significant players in the combat,  Wolfe does.  Wolfe was a player.  He is out there somewhere on the otherside, talking to "them" and not to "us" at night, and this causes me the pain of sorely missing a guy I spent many an hour beside in the trenches.  I miss Greg.  I hope I don't have to go head to head with him,  but, if duty calls.....----cgy

I hear that former Enron marketers Greg Wolfe and Holli Krebs will be joining AEP.  AEP does not yet have an office in Portland, but Greg is working out of his house.  Holli has not yet started work because her non-compete agreement is still in force.
