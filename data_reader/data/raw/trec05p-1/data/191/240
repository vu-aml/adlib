Amy's calculations should be close depending on:

1. verification of the volume TW owes ECS for January, and

2. Did ECS actually sell 25,000/day during those last 10 days of December? Randy seems to be saying that they sold 25,000/day for 5 days.

I have attached a spreadsheet which shows my calculations for the compressor gas, please tell me of there is something missing from my logic.  I have also attached the scheduled quantities for their contract for December.

Randy, Stephanie asked me to send this to you.  Is this correct with your records?

For December we should have scheduled 363289 to ECS.

We Scheduled 250000.

Therefore, as of the end of December, we still need to schedule an additional 113289.

So far 15000 was scheduled for 1/2/02 and 11000 will be scheduled for the 3rd.

I did not receive any official numbers this month as to how much we owed ENA for January, so that still needs to be figured out.

I hope this is what you need,
Amy
