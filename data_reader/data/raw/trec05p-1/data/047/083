Attn: Chairman/Director, 



Dear Sir, 



I am Mrs. Luisa E.Maciek a personal secretary to Mikhail Khodorkovsky th=
e richest man in Russia and 
owner of the following companies: 



Chairman CEO: YUKOS OIL (Russian Largest Oil Company) 

Chairman CEO: Menatep SBP Bank 

(A well reputable financial Institution) with its branches all over the =
world 



I seek your partnership to accommodate the sum of US$4.2M for us. My Bos=
s got arrested for his 
involvement in politics in financing the Leading and opposing political =
party (the Union of Right Forces, led by 
Boris Nemtsov and Yabloko, a liberal/social democratic party led by Greg=
or Yavlinsky) which posed treat to 
President Vladimir 

Putin's second tenure as Russian president before he was re-elected On M=
arch 14, 2004. You can catch 
more of the story on this 



http://newsfromrussia.com/main/2003/11/13/51215.html 



The fund (US$4.2M) in question was approved by the Government of Russia =
for payment of various 
YUKOS OIL contractors/suppliers to prevent them from loosing the money 

they invested in the numerous contracts they executed for the above firm=
. The Government had already 
concluded plans to freeze all the accounts in my boss name (Mikhail Khod=
orkovsky) both corporate and 
personal before I connived with the Accountant General of YUKOS OIL (who=
 is also my partner in this 
transaction) to raise a memo stating that YUKOS OIL owe contractors the =
above amount which was finally 
approved for payment after some deliberations. 

Actually, we have paid all our contractors both local and foreign becaus=
e they agitated for their payment when 
they had that my boss was arrested. 



YOUR ROLE: I will present you / your 

Company as one of the contractors we are Owing so that you can stand as =
the beneficiary of the above 
quoted sum or part of the fund according to your financial strength or t=
he strength of your company. I will 
arrange for the documentation which the payee/corresponding bank will ne=
ed to transfer the sum to you. I 
have decided to use this sum to relocate to American continent and never=
 to be connected to any of Mikhail 
Khodorkovsky conglomerates. The transaction has to be concluded as soon =
as possible. You will be 
rewarded with reasonable percentage of the total sum for your partnershi=
p and assistance 



Can you honestly be our partner on this transaction? If yes do reach me =
or write at the following email: 
luisaestrada@mail2cutey.com 

Thank you very much 



Best regards, 

Ms. Luisa E.Maciek
