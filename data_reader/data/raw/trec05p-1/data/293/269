Hi Lisa,

I am working on a Hedging Activity Report that will be sent to E&Y on a weekly basis.  I think Mo is out of the office so I heard that you might be the right person to ask for help.  For the first week, I am using a spreadsheet that Mo sent where he bought some July power at MID C.  It looks like the MID C power along with our NW Del length makes us flat for July at MID C and Montana System Border as well.  My questions are:

How does power flow between MID C and the other delivery points (like Montana)?
Do we incur a transmission cost on top of what he bought the power for?
We are actually a little long (960 MWh) b/c of the Air Products deal that is a little unique ... what happens to this length?

If it's easier to explain over the phone, please give me a call at 713-853-4748.  Thanks for your help.

Steve
