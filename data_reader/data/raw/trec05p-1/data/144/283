Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football 
Newsletter! The newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox 
at the end of every week, and will include news about the 
web site; tips on using all the features available; and 
answers to your player-related questions from the "Gridiron 
Guru." 


THANKSGIVING FOOTBALL

Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: 
Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 
4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from 
these four teams on your roster, they must have their final 
status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of 
their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be 
able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one 
hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football 
Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner 
to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.


SORTABLE STANDINGS

Did you know that every column on your Standings page is
sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column 
to sort the report by the results of that category. In head-
to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order 
of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you 
can click the "PF" (Points For) column to display the top 
point-scoring teams at the top; or the "PA" (Points Against) 
column to display, in descending order, the teams with the 
most fantasy points scored against them.

THE GRIDIRON GURU

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions 
about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We 
invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on 
players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance 
to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like 
yourself! 


Marcus Howell: Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese 
at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?

G.G. - Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries 
this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle 
injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been 
bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer 
seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But 
remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has 
never been able to string many good performances together in 
the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be 
primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by 
Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post 
respectable numbers at Dallas.

Eric Fernau: Which three running backs should I start?  I 
have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest 
Holmes and Garrison Hearst.

G.G. - Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is 
facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but 
will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside. 
Staley should have little trouble ripping through the 
Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at 
Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon, 
Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.

Jay Rassat: Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have 
Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they 
play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).

G.G. - Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and 
each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play. 
Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of 
a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady. 
With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew 
Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New 
England QB.

TIP OF THE WEEK

Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not 
have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for 
people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be 
surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a 
great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a 
back like Alexander.
