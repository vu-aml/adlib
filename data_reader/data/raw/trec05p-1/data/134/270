About-KSIGN Int'l., INC.

As an unchallenged PKI-based solution provider,
KSIGN has played an important and market leading
role in building a reliable and safe e-world. KSIGN
established in 1999, in spite of its short business
history, has grown dramatically and gained a good
reputation as a technology and market leader in Korea.
With the endeavors poured into R&D of PKI solutions,
it has also developed many applications like Extranet
Access Management, Key Roaming System, Secure Web and
Application Transaction System, Crypto toolkit and so
on. From now on, it will continue to be a valued partner
to Korean e-Government, Korean CA's (Certificate
Authorities), financial institutes, educational
organizations and enterprises.

Latest News:

KSignPassOne is a type of Single Sign On (SSO) solution
which safely and efficiently manages numerous user names
and passwords for each end-user by applying appropriate
security functions and digital certificates. The solution
then automatically processes login by detecting login page
when accessing a certain website or client/server
environment on the Internet.

Enterprises and public institutions will be able to
provide their employees with easy access to complex
networks and websites on the Internet that previously
required unique user names and password authentication
at different locations. With KSignPassOne's central
management of user names and passwords, the user will
be able to automatically login, resulting in dramatic
savings in effort and time. KSign is planning to supply
the product to Japanese market through an exclusive
distributor.

*Attention KSIG is expected to perform very well, if
you like to win this one is for you, big gains expected
don't miss out. Get it immediately before Friday, because
the fax promotion will be launched over the weekend and
next week will have record breaking results.
