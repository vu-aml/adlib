Ollie,

Congrats on hooking up with a little long-term action.  Always thought you'd be one of the first to go.  Send her down south to Portland if it looks like she's getting board with your "itsy bitsy".

I've kept in touch with Carl and Brett but not much else.  Funny how time can just slip by.  I think back to the days in school and yup...just like I thought, everything seems so cool.  I think of how nice it would be to have scores of friends within a block and three bars to choose from... but it didn't seem that super at the time.  I specifically remember getting pissed on a Tuesday night, playing darts at Shakers with throngs of 20 something girls around and shrugging it off as "boring".  

You may be suprised to hear it, but I am still on with Enron and looking forward to a buyout in a week or so.  As strange as it may seem, this whole fiscad may have been a huge blessing in disguise...I'll just keep my fingers crossed.

I'm doing a lot of skiing this year.  Let me know when and where we should meet up.  I'd like to see the likes of Toby, Ty, Nate, Ken and even Palmy.
