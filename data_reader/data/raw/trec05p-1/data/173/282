Bill:  Can you direct me to the person who allocates the Black Marlin delivery meter for Transok.  I think we (NNG) are getting information only for the volumes through the meter for the account of Lamar Power.  Now, since we have only two delivery points, you might think I could subtract - but...I really need to know that the allocations for Lamar Power and AEP sum to the actual meter volume between Transok and NNG.  Can you help?  Steve Weller (713-853-3000)
