Julie, Erin:

I find the agenda for this 3-RTO conference to be very anti-market.

Is there someone at EPSA that would be available to participate in this workshop?  I or others at Enron would be glad to place a call or two to see if the panels could be more balanced.

Take Care,

Alan Comnes
Enron Corp.
