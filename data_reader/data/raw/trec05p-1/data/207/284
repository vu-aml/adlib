Lloyd/Rika,

Kevin has asked me to be the commercial lead on continuing and expediting the development of the system for the traders that provided real-time pricing, curve shift, positions, etc. that was in the works last year.  Could you please provide me with the names of the IT people I need to contact and/or the lead on the project?  Thanks,

Fletch
