Here is what Bob Cotten has to say about Big Cowboy.  I think I will try to have Conoco send our money back until we can determine who we bought the gas from.

Megan, 

The April and May nomination spreadsheets from Producer Services reflect that there were purchases from Conoco on HPL.  There are no references to any purchases from Conoco on GEPL.  On June 6, 2001, Tom Acton edited deal ticket # 133304 to include GEPL meter #'s 27-002-08 and 27-003-08.  I have no idea why Tom edited the deal ticket to include the GEPL meters.  Tom is no longer at AEP and I couldn't find any documentation to support the changes.  Please advise if you need additional information.

Bob:
Can you help with this?  I am trying to find out why GEPL was added to
the Conoco supply deals for April and May 2001.  Conoco says we did not
purchase any gas from them on GEPL.
