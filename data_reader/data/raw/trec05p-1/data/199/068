Dear NYTimes.com Member,

One of the most meaningful features to appear in The New 
York Times and on NYTimes.com is Portraits of Grief. This 
feature first began running on September 15 and presented 
brief profiles of World Trade Center victims. On December 
31 the final daily edition of Portraits of Grief appeared 
in The New York Times newspaper. A book will be published 
this year, and the feature will continue to appear from 
time to time, as more names become known and more families 
agree to interviews. 

In the meantime, we invite you to visit the Web site to 
see a complete collection of Portraits of Grief, 
alphabetized and listed by day. This archive represents 
all the Portraits published to date. They will remain at 
NYTimes.com indefinitely.

Another recent special feature has been the multimedia 
photo essay. We have already talked here about the essays 
done by Vincent Laforet and James Hill. I would now like 
to direct your attention to the newest, this one by Times 
staff photographer Ruth Fremson about the women in 
Afghanistan. The essay features a very strong audio 
commentary, which makes the point that not all the women 
feel the same about the head-to-toe veil they were 
required to wear under the Taliban's rule: in fact, many 
are very comfortable dressed as they are.

We have enjoyed participating in almost daily 
"conversations" with correspondents of The New York Times. 
In these unstructured talks, each correspondent provides 
information not only about the news he or she is covering, 
but on what life is like in the particular place he or she 
is located. There are over 50 discussions now available 
for listening in audio format.

The Winter Olympics games at Salt Lake City begin soon and 
NYTimes.com already has started covering this event. Our 
Olympics section covers security concerns, athlete 
profiles and an interactive map of the torch relay. 
Special e-mail updates are now available, and include 
periodic countdown reports and details of the torch run, 
athlete profiles and event previews. When the games begin 
on Feb. 8, we'll send daily dispatches with event results 
and exclusive "postcards" from Salt Lake City by Times 
sports reporter George Vecsey.

4. The Outlook for business and the markets in 2002

economic Outlook section, which includes useful articles 
by the New York Times staff.

6. Best of 2001 in the arts

The critics of The New York Times review the year in the 
arts, including top 10 lists for the year's best movies, 
albums and television shows.

------
7. For students, "TEST" doesn't have to be a four-letter 
word
------

The Learning Network's Word of the Day and Test Prep 
Question of the Day help students build their vocabulary 
for upcoming standardized tests in ways that are fun and 
interactive. Every weekday there's a focus on a different 
word -- its definition and an example of its use in the 
context of a recent Times article; and students can then 
test their understanding online with the day's analogy or 
sentence completion question.
