Class of '96,

Well the big 5-year reunion is final upon us!  Events start this Friday and
we are looking forward to seeing you in LA!  We have heard from just about
everyone regarding your attendance, and are pleased to hear that we will
have such a great turn-out!  Should be an awesome weekend  --  if you
haven't responded yet, please let us know your plans!

The last thing we need to do this week is get everyone to Register and pay
for the events you plan to attend -- this is important for several obvious
reasons, but first-and-foremost so that the event organizers can get a
proper headcount for buying food, drinks, name tags, and the works!  Please
register ASAP if you haven't done so already...

You can register in one of three ways:

1)  Online Registration - available until ***Wed, Oct 31st*** - go to
http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/alumni/
2)  Phone-in Registration - call 1-800-333-ALUM -- this option will be
available until ***Thurs, Nov 1st***
3)  Walk-up Registration - not the preferred method, but we always want you
there -- so worst case you can still sign up at the gate for most events!

Note:  You may still be able to mail in your registration, but it may not
arrive in time so best to use one of these methods...

Looking forward to seeing you this weekend!    Let me/us know if any
questions!

Sincerely,
Steve Smith
On behalf of Pete, Lynne, Melissa and many Reunion Organizers
