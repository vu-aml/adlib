Where do you stand on Broker Client?  As you can see below, some of the European desks are supportive of getting deals done, but I am leery of continuing Broker Client roll-out if there remains a chance that we will pull back from this offering in the near future.  Also, I ran into Presto and he said he hadn't yet spoken to you about his issues with the product.  Let me know what your position is and we'll go from there.

Thanks,
Brad

Brad,

True Quote would like to finalize a deal with us in Europe also.  I have approval from each of the European desks.  I can get $200 K if you want me to proceed.

Brad,
It looks like I have taken back control of the TFS Europe deal.  I have received confirmation from each of the different desks that this is something they are willing to pursue.  I went back to Alan Kurzer (president of TFS) with 300,000 Euros (about $265k USD) for Continental Power, UK power and Int'l. Coal.  He didn't bite so I told him to show me a bid.  I'll let you know how it goes.  I've got a call into Mark Greenberg about the contractual issues.  It should be something we can address in the amendment.
