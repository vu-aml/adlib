Sheila,
	I have received a few phone calls from Utilicorp (Keith Milem) stating they are unhappy with the removal of Scheduled Quantity report. Not only do their schedulers use this report on a daily basis, their accounting personnel use it to tie out volumes at the end of the month.  Thanks.

Randy
