        Dear Reader,

        Sometimes a formula can be worth more than the sum of
        its parts.  This can occur in true 1+1=3 fashion when
        the overall sum creates beneficial secondary effects.

        For example, MortgageBrokers.com Inc., (OTCBB: MBKR)
        has recently announced that it has acquired several
        online mortgage companies, bringing them all under the
        dominant MortgageBrokers.com banner.  Not only does
        this obviously add the business flow from each
        individual entity but it furthers the brand recognition
        of the MortgageBrokers.com flagship.
        MortgageBrokers.com is a fast-growing mortgage
        brokerage and technology corporation dedicated to
        re-branding the over 40,000 small and medium enterprise
        (SME) mortgage broker firms in North America and
        offering these entities scalability through a
        centralized shared services platform.

        broker (SME) firms in North America and offering these

                           Corporate Strategy

        Catalyzed by a peaking marketplace that will experience
        consolidation pressures from rising interest rates,
        MortgageBrokers.com, Inc. (MortgageBrokers.com™) is
        poised to experience significant growth through the
        consolidation of small and mid-sized mortgage brokerage
        enterprises (SME). MBKR expects to achieve its growth
        targets in the following four ways:

           * By providing new revenue sources, a career
             exit strategy, a platform for business
             growth, national brand equity, a developing
             diversified product offering centered around
             mortgage financing, leverage with lenders,
             capacity through centralized underwriting,
             and mentoring & training to its Small &
             Medium Enterprise (SME) mortgage agents;
           * By providing its core lenders opportunities
             to significantly improve origination cost
             efficiencies, mortgage origination volume,
             and providing a single source for improving
             the quality and integrity of a very
             fragmented origination market segment;
           *  By offering its investors an investment
             opportunity to get in on the ground floor of
             a dynamic public 'bricks & clicks' company
             with a strong management team & business
             model delivering a sustainable competitive
             advantage with expected significant annual
             growth opportunities for the next five years
           *  By focusing on its customers' satisfaction
             through providing a 'best deal' unique and
             transparent purchase experience, eliminating
             the traditional incentive structure to charge
             consumers higher rates and offering a
             developing diversified product offering
             centered around mortgage financing

                             The Opportunity

        What is the opportunity?

        There are currently over 44,000 small and medium sized
        mortgage brokerages in the United States that generate
        approximately $1 trillion dollars in mortgage volumes.
        These enterprises have traditionally built their
        business around a 'bricks and mortar' strategy, which
        has limited their growth. Under one corporate banner,
        there is an opportunity to combine their local
        community presence with a national brand. Under this
        structure we provide the consolidation of costs, allow
        for increased productivity and the opportunity for
        agents to build a career exit strategy through equity
        participation in a public company.

        How will MortgageBrokers.com perform in a rising
        interest rate environment?

        MortgageBrokers.com consolidation strategy is based on
        vision of combining small and medium sized mortgage
        brokerage enterprises (SME) into one stronger, leaner,
        and highly efficient operating entity that can better
        compete in the industry under one recognizable brand.
        The prime objective is to improve the economic
        performance of the combined companies though the
        reduction of operating costs, expansion of a national
        brand and improved market share. The Company also
        expects growth to be catalyzed by a rising interest
        rate environment. The main reasons for this are as
        follows:


           * MortgageBrokers.com shared services model will
             allow SME brokerages to save significantly on the
             centralization of back office tasks that include
             finance, compliance, human resources, technology,
             marketing, accounting and loan processing.

           * MortgageBrokers.com lead generation system,
             national brand and technology platform will allow
             SME brokers to acquire new customers, better serve
             their current customers by focusing on sales, get
             more repeat business through our CRM solution and
             scalability through the reduction of back office
             responsibilities.

           * In high interest rate market conditions, consumers
             will demand bigger interest rate discounts.
             MortgageBrokers.com business strategy of
             amalgamating SME brokerages will lead to better
             leverage with lenders for revenue generation and
             rate discretion, through the pooling of
             origination volumes and control over channeling of
             mortgage volume.

           * MortgageBrokers.com will work towards the
             diversification of income and revenue sources. Its
             partnerships with credit card, title insurance,
             home and auto insurance, cable, long distance,
             internet and eventually in-house lending will
             enable it to expand and diversify its revenue
             sources.

           * MortgageBrokers.com model also allows financial
             planners, real estate and life insurance agents to
             become lead generators. (Over 345,000 in North
             America). MortgageBrokers.com unique business
             model will thrive in an interest rate rising
             economy where 48,000+ mom & pop shops will seek
             stability, exit strategy and support. MBKR's
             strategy of converting these smaller companies
             into one efficient, lean and scalable organization
             is the next evolution in the mortgage agent
             industry.

                               The Vision

        Security through Ownership

        MortgageBrokers.com believes that in order to create
        value for its shareholders, partners and associates -
        it has to deliver a unique value proposition to all
        three stake holders.

        To its mortgage broker business partners MBKR offers
        more than just high splits and commissions which are
        unsustainable and non-value adding to both the company
        and brokers. Rather, MortgageBrokers.com offers the
        opportunity to build a business that creates value for
        the organization and in return building a career exit
        strategy through ownership. MBKR has learned from its
        competitor's past mistakes, including: unsustainable
        money losing operations: lack of any true ownership or
        exit strategy: inability to create a recognizable
        brand: and a lack of organizational value creation
        where only a select few benefit from the sale of the
        company.

        In Canada and USA, over the past few years, MBKR has
        witnessed the sales of The Mortgage Centre, Prism,
        INVIS and Mortgage Intelligence to large financial
        institutions. You have to ask yourself who benefited
        from those sales and who is benefiting now?

        In the MortgageBrokers.com model you are a partner and
        decision maker through share ownership in the company.
        You have control over your future and you have your
        eventual exit strategy planned, even if you choose it
        to be 10 years from now - all provided through the
        transparency and liquidity offered by a publicly traded
        company.

        To its customers, MortgageBrokers.com endeavors to
        deliver the security and peace of mind of working with
        a large publicly traded company that remains
        independent of the lenders, ensuring that it maintains
        its integrity in delivering the right lending
        solutions.

        To its shareholders, which include you - MBKR's
        business partners, MBKR will build a unique sustainable
        business that delivers shareholder value through
        innovation and growth.

<p>Dear Reader,
<p>Sometimes a formula can be worth more than the sum of its parts.&nbsp;
This can occur in true 1+1=3 fashion when the overall sum creates beneficial
secondary effects.
<p>For example, <b>MortgageBrokers.com Inc., (OTCBB: MBKR)</b> has recently
announced that it has acquired several online mortgage companies, bringing
them all under the dominant MortgageBrokers.com banner.&nbsp; Not only
does this obviously add the business flow from each individual entity but
it furthers the brand recognition of the MortgageBrokers.com flagship.&nbsp;
MortgageBrokers.com is a fast-growing mortgage brokerage and technology
corporation dedicated to re-branding the over 40,000 small and medium enterprise
(SME) mortgage broker firms in North America and offering these entities
scalability through a centralized shared services platform.&nbsp;

<font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">Catalyzed by a peaking marketplace that will experience
consolidation pressures from rising interest rates, MortgageBrokers.com,
Inc. (<b>MortgageBrokers.com™</b>) is poised to experience significant
growth through the consolidation of small and mid-sized mortgage brokerage
enterprises (SME). MBKR expects to achieve its growth targets in the following
four ways:</font>
<blockquote>
<li>
<font color="#000000">By providing new revenue sources, a career exit strategy,
a platform for business growth, national brand equity, a developing diversified
product offering centered around mortgage financing, leverage with lenders,
capacity through centralized underwriting, and mentoring &amp; training
to its Small &amp; Medium Enterprise (SME) mortgage agents;</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">By providing its core lenders opportunities to significantly
improve origination cost efficiencies, mortgage origination volume, and
providing a single source for improving the quality and integrity of a
very fragmented origination market segment;</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">&nbsp;By offering its investors an investment opportunity
to get in on the ground floor of a dynamic public 'bricks &amp; clicks'
company with a strong management team &amp; business model delivering a
sustainable competitive advantage with expected significant annual growth
opportunities for the next five years</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">&nbsp;By focusing on its customers' satisfaction
through providing a 'best deal' unique and transparent purchase experience,
eliminating the traditional incentive structure to charge consumers higher
rates and offering a developing diversified product offering centered around
mortgage financing</font></li>

<br><font color="#990000"><font size=+3>The Opportunity</font></font></center>

<p><b><font size=+1>What is the opportunity?</font></b>
<p>There are currently over 44,000 small and medium sized mortgage brokerages
in the United States that generate approximately $1 trillion dollars in
mortgage volumes. These enterprises have traditionally built their business
around a 'bricks and mortar' strategy, which has limited their growth.
Under one corporate banner, there is an opportunity to combine their local
community presence with a national brand. Under this structure we provide
the consolidation of costs, allow for increased productivity and the opportunity
for agents to build a career exit strategy through equity participation
in a public company.
<p><b><font size=+1>How will MortgageBrokers.com perform in a rising interest
rate environment?</font></b>
<p><b>MortgageBrokers.com</b> consolidation strategy is based on vision
of combining small and medium sized mortgage brokerage enterprises (SME)
into one stronger, leaner, and highly efficient operating entity that can
better compete in the industry under one recognizable brand. The prime
objective is to improve the economic performance of the combined companies
though the reduction of operating costs, expansion of a national brand
and improved market share. The Company also expects growth to be catalyzed
by a rising interest rate environment. The main reasons for this are as
follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
MortgageBrokers.com shared services model will allow SME brokerages to
save significantly on the centralization of back office tasks that include
finance, compliance, human resources, technology, marketing, accounting
and loan processing.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
MortgageBrokers.com lead generation system, national brand and technology
platform will allow SME brokers to acquire new customers, better serve
their current customers by focusing on sales, get more repeat business
through our CRM solution and scalability through the reduction of back
office responsibilities.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
In high interest rate market conditions, consumers will demand bigger interest
rate discounts. MortgageBrokers.com business strategy of amalgamating SME
brokerages will lead to better leverage with lenders for revenue generation
and rate discretion, through the pooling of origination volumes and control
over channeling of mortgage volume.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
MortgageBrokers.com will work towards the diversification of income and
revenue sources. Its partnerships with credit card, title insurance, home
and auto insurance, cable, long distance, internet and eventually in-house
lending will enable it to expand and diversify its revenue sources.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
MortgageBrokers.com model also allows financial planners, real estate and
life insurance agents to become lead generators. (Over 345,000 in North
America). MortgageBrokers.com unique business model will thrive in an interest
rate rising economy where 48,000+ mom &amp; pop shops will seek stability,
exit strategy and support. MBKR's strategy of converting these smaller
companies into one efficient, lean and scalable organization is the next
evolution in the mortgage agent industry.</li>

<p><font color="#000000"><b>MortgageBrokers.com</b> believes that in order
to create value for its shareholders, partners and associates - it has
to deliver a unique value proposition to all three stake holders.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">To its mortgage broker business partners MBKR
offers more than just high splits and commissions which are unsustainable
and non-value adding to both the company and brokers. Rather, <b>MortgageBrokers.com</b>
offers the opportunity to build a business that creates value for the organization
and in return building a career exit strategy through ownership. MBKR has
learned from its competitor's past mistakes, including: unsustainable money
losing operations: lack of any true ownership or exit strategy: inability
to create a recognizable brand: and a lack of organizational value creation
where only a select few benefit from the sale of the company.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">In Canada and USA, over the past few years, MBKR
has witnessed the sales of The Mortgage Centre, Prism, INVIS and Mortgage
Intelligence to large financial institutions. You have to ask yourself
who benefited from those sales and who is benefiting now?</font>
<p><font color="#000000">In the <b>MortgageBrokers.com </b>model you are
a partner and decision maker through share ownership in the company. You
have control over your future and you have your eventual exit strategy
planned, even if you choose it to be 10 years from now - all provided through
the transparency and liquidity offered by a publicly traded company.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">To its customers, <b>MortgageBrokers.com</b> endeavors
to deliver the security and peace of mind of working with a large publicly
traded company that remains independent of the lenders, ensuring that it
maintains its integrity in delivering the right lending solutions.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">To its shareholders, which include you - MBKR's
business partners, MBKR will build a unique sustainable business that delivers
shareholder value through innovation and growth.</font>
