> This is a true story about a recent wedding that took place at Clemson

>
>  It was a huge wedding with about 300 guests. After the wedding, at
the
> reception, the groom got up on stage with a microphone to talk to the
> crowd. He said he wanted to thank everyone for coming, many from long
> distances, to support them at their wedding. He especially wanted to
> thank the bride's and his family and to thank his new father-in-law
for
> providing such a lavish reception.
>
>  As a token of his deep appreciation he said he wanted to give
everyone a
> special gift just from him. So taped to the bottom of everyone's
chair,
> including the wedding party, was a manila envelope. He said this was
his
> gift to everyone, and asked them to open their envelope.
>
>  Inside each manila envelope was an 8x10 glossy of his bride having
sex
> with the best man. The groom had gotten suspicious of them weeks
earlier

verify

>
>  After just standing there, just watching the guests' reactions for a
> couple of minutes, he turned to the best man and said, "F--- you"; he
> turned to his bride and said, "F--- you!" Then he turned to the
> dumbfounded crowd and said, "I'm outta here."
>
>  He had the marriage annulled first thing in the morning. While most
people
> would have canceled the wedding immediately after finding out about
the
> affair, this guy goes through with the charade, as if nothing were
wrong.
>
>  His revenge ... making the bride's parents pay the $32,000 for a 300
> guest wedding and reception, and best of all, trashing the bride's and
> best man's reputations in front of 300 friends and family members.
This
