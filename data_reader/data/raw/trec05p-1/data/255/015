The data coming back from the RTU at Maple Lake # 1 , MN is incorrect. They are having problems with the phone line and are planning repairs when the ground thaws out enough so it can be replaced. For the time being, all the necessary data has been put on chart recorders. I inhibited the RTU to take it out of scan.
