> "Politics Explained" - Rated R
>
> A little boy goes to his dad and asks, "What is politics?"
>
> Dad says, "Well son, let me try to explain it this way: I'm the
> breadwinner of the family, so let's call me capitalism. Your Mom,
> she's the administrator of the money, so we'll call her the
> Government. We're here to take care of your needs, so we'll call you
> the people. The nanny, we'll consider her the Working Class. And your
> baby brother, we'll call him the Future. Now, think about that and
> see if that makes sense,"
>
> So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what dad had said.
> Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to
> check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper.
> So the little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his mother
> sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room.
> Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father
> in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next
> morning, the little boy says to his father, "Dad, I think I
> Understand the concept of politics now." The father says, "Good son,
> tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about." The
> little boy replies, "Well, while Capitalism is screwing the Working
> Class, the Government is sound asleep, the People are being ignored
> and the Future is in deep shit."
