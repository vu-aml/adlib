OK here is the spreadsheet. Please look at Sheet Kam and Sheet Phillip. On each sheet just put the names of primary and alternative approvers it doesn't matter is it is in your sheet or Philip's sheet. 

Thanks for your help,

Erica,

I need to make some changes to the list of e-request approvers.  

Anne Bike has left the group and I will be taking over all her requests.  Anything related to sitara and TDS for the west desk will now be my responsibility. 
Phillip Love should now be the approver for all TDS and sitara requests related to the EAST and VNG regions.
Scott Palmer will be responsible for TDS and sitara for Wellhead, Central and Chicago regions.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks

Kam
