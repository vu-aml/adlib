I believe you will still have to allocate.  We probably will still have FS reporting requirements; therefore, you will have to ensure the various segments will have their ENW costs.

Wes,
Based on your comments last month, we are not planning on assessing any ENW allocations to other business units (except for regulated companies).  Please let me know if this assumption is not correct.
