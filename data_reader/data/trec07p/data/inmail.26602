An anonymous reader writes "The Google Librarian Central site has up a
piece by Mark Aubin, a Software Engineer who works on Google Earth. Aubin
[0]explains some of the process behind capturing satellite imagery for
use with the product. 'Most people are surprised to learn that we have
more than one source for our imagery. We collect it via airplane and
satellite, but also just about any way you can imagine getting a camera
above the Earth's surface: hot air balloons, model airplanes - even
kites. The traditional aerial survey involves mounting a special
gyroscopic, stabilized camera in the belly of an airplane and flying it
at an elevation of between 15,000 feet and 30,000 feet, depending on the
resolution of imagery you're interested in. As the plane takes a
predefined route over the desired area, it forms a series of parallel
lines with about 40 percent overlap between lines and 60 percent overlap
in the direction of flight. This overlap of images is what provides us
with enough detail to remove distortions caused by the varying shape of
the Earth's surface.'

el_flynn writes "BusinessWeek is reporting on [0]a new submarine cable
system that will link South East Asia directly with the USA. Designated
Asia-America Gateway (AAG), the project will involve a consortium of 17
international telcos, including AT&T Inc, India's Bharti AirTel, BT
Global Network Services, CAT Telekom (Thailand), Eastern
Telecommunications Philippines Inc (Philippines), Indosat (Indonesia) and
Pacific Communications Pte Ltd (Cambodia). Led by Telekom Malaysia
Berhad, the project is slated for completion in 2008, where 20,000km of
cables will be providing a capacity of up to 1.92 Terabits per second of
data bandwidth. Interestingly, the fibre-optic cable system will be
taking a different route from many existing cables to avoid quake-prone
areas and a repeat of the disruption to Asian web access caused by a
tremor off Taiwan four months ago."

via new, more sophisticated techniques. Yes, you still wear glasses. No
you don't get a headache. Yes, the effect is fantastic. This story looks
at the technology, past and future projects, and why just about every
major studio is now planning in three dimensions. 'There is indeed a
revolution in cinema taking place. It's quietly slipped under the radar
of most technophiles, beginning its assault on the way we consume media
clothed in thoroughly unassuming garb -- the Disney Digital 3-D film,
Meet the Robinsons ... no, we don't blame you for being skeptical. Most
people in their mid-20s or later think of 3-D movies from the old school
perspective -- goofy red and blue coloured glasses, strained eyes,
possible migraines. And most importantly, a so-so 3-D effect. No more.'"

[0]prostoalex writes "Is music played via customized playlist delivered
interactively (i.e., via user participation) or non-interactive (i.e.,
decisions are made on the server side)? The question does seem
metaphysical, but it took Sony BMG Music Entertainment and Yahoo! [1]six
years to figure it out via a protracted legal battle. User-driven
playlists are bucketed with on-demand music services, while server-driven
playlists are equaled to broadcasts, thereby causing different licensing
mechanisms to take place. Yahoo! inherited the legal wrangle when it
purchased a music startup Launch, which [2]built a music recommendation
feature. The court decision determined that recommendation algorithms
that rely on usage data to build playlists server-side are still eligible
for broadcast license, thereby substantially lowering the costs of
operating a music recommendation site."

The following was written by frequent Slashdot editorial contributor
[0]Bennett Haselton. He writes "Recently author [1]Annalee Newitz created
a bit of a stir with the revelation that she had [2]bought her way to the
front page of the story-ranking site [3]Digg. Since Digg allows any
registered user to go to a story's URL and "digg it" in order to push it
upward through the story-ranking system, it was inevitable that services
like [4]User/Submitter would come along, where a Digg user can pay for
other users to cast votes to push their story up to the top.
User/Submitter says they are currently [5]backlogged and not taking new
orders, but they say the service will return and will soon feature
services for manipulating similar sites like Digg competitor [6]reddit.
Even if the new U/S features are vaporware, it probably won't be long
before other companies offer similar services. But it seems like all of
these story-ranking sites could prevent the manipulation by making one
simple change to their voting algorithm."

can deliver up to 40 watts of power — enough for some laptops. The

devices to recharge will need to incorporate a special receiver, don't
expect to see these plastic power sheets on sale before several years."

Unfortunately, there are some less cheery things to discuss as well.
[2]Virtual Console sales are down, apparently, and some analysts are
questioning whether [3]Nintendo's success may be bad for the industry
overall. As for the 360 ... the [4]Elite may be bringing back some old
problems. 'Red Rings of Death' have already been reported with the
just-released consoles, and [5]DRM issues with Live Arcade titles on the
'upgraded' system are making some new owners frustrated.

[0]AlexGr writes to tell us that Jeff Gould has a somewhat jaded look at
the [1]commercial push of Open Source and what that may be doing to the
overall Open Source movement. "I've been a Linux fan for years, but
lately I wonder if the drum beating from the big IT vendors in favor of
open source hasn't finally slipped over the edge from sincere enthusiasm
to meaningless — or in some cases downright hypocritical — sloganeering.
The example that brought this gloomy thought to mind was a recent IBM
press release touting a 'new open client solution' as an 'alternative to
vendor lock-in'. Wow. Imagine that. An alternative to vendor lock-in."

[0]s1axter writes "A week and a half ago I received Linux Appliance
Design by Bob Smith, John Hardin, Graham Phillips and Bill Pierce,
published by No Starch Press. This is one of No Starch's latest titles
and was released in the beginning of April. As a hardware/embedded
systems guy I was really eager to get my hands on the book. For those who
don't know what the book is about, it's about making an application
specific utility, an electronic tool or "appliance" that can be used for
a specific task. The book defines an appliance as "A device designed to
primarily perform a single function" and that's exactly what they do."
Read on for the rest of S1axter's review.

[0]Andy Updegrove writes "Governments are beginning to realize that
perhaps the Internet really has changed everything, at least for them,
and that they are going to have to [1]deal with new responsibilities in
this area. How will they deal with financial and medical data breaches?
What can they do to ensure that first responders will be able to
communicate the next time that terrorists strike in the Homeland, and how
will the refugees of the next Katrina be able to access their electronic
medical records? And what must governments do to ensure that public
records will be available in fifty years, if they no longer maintain
paper archives? Whether government should incline towards leading,
following or simply getting out of the way is a matter upon which there
are likely to be strongly held differences of opinion. It's also likely,
though, that government will not have the luxury of opting for the third
choice in some of the areas just mentioned. How well government chooses
among those roles, and how well it executes when it chooses to lead, will
likely have a profound impact on our lives in the years ahead."

The Supreme Court today [0]sided with Microsoft in another important
patent case filed by AT&T. The case centered around whether selling
Windows overseas infringed on AT&T's patents that are in Windows.
[1]Microsoft argued [PDF] that the copies being sold in Asia were "...not
technically supplied from the United States because overseas
manufacturers of its computers made copies of the software from a master
disk and installed those copies into the operating system. Microsoft said
it could not be considered a supplier since the copies, not the original
software, were in the computers built abroad." Now, while I support the
weakening of software patents in general, by this logic, would that mean
that MS's patents don't apply to those that use pirated copies of
Windows?

SexCaptain writes "MacRumors.com reveals a letter circulated by Apple to
all producers of content for the iTunes Store, announcing that from May
onward they can [0]sell their music at higher quality and free of DRM.
Hopefully this opens the doors for labels like Netwerk. This is a big
step in the right direction, although it's unclear exactly what Apple
means by 'higher quality,' and there is no mention of price changes.
(Apple charges $0.30 more per song for [1]DRM-free content from EMI and
encodes it at 256K.) Quoting from the letter: 'Many of you have reached
out to iTunes to find out how you can make your songs available higher
quality and DRM-free," Apple wrote in the communication. "Starting next
month, iTunes will begin offering higher-quality, DRM-free music and
DRM-free music videos to all customers."
