Sounds like the pizza eating contest is on.

John,
Last weekend I tried to say my poor Italian was "driving my professor to
drink"  Guiardo mi professoro a bevere or something like that.  Just like
"quick bite" got Kim a funny look in Greece, "flip a coin" may or may not be
known in Italy.  We get in trouble almost every class either using a literal
translation or slang.  It's funny you don't realize how much there is till
you try an translate.

Ms. Vespoli -

Thanks for the name correction.  One confirming question:  do you have TWO
of the standard double rooms, instead of one standard and one superior, for
the same dates?  We'd like to have the same class of room instead of having
to "flip a coin" to decide who gets which room.

Thanks,
John Watson
