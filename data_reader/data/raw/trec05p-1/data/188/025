Eric,

Thanks for the Congrats.  Sorry I didn't get to see ya,  it'd been 6 months 
since I'd gotten to see Marilyn and we had to go through the "rough 
re-acclimation" period so once we got over it we wanted to spend all our 
remaining time together.  The holiday bowl did in fact rock, I look forward 
to next season.  How are you hangnin with this Enron fiasco?  You workin fer 
Dynergy now?

We're rollin to the field tomorrow, I'll drop ya a note when we get out.

Take Care,

Brett.
