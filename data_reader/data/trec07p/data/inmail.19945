Making news today...

* Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) makes it official today with a 12 pm ET campaign announcement at a rally in Portsmouth, NH.
He also holds a 5 pm ET rally in Manchester, NH.  McCain will speak to reporters after each event.

CNN's Candy Crowley reports from Portsmouth:

"You never get a second chance to make a first impression unless you're in politics. In this elongated campaign season,
there are third and fourth chances, opportunities to "re-set" a campaign slow to get off the starting block.

"This brings us to Sen. John McCain who today officially announces his presidential campaign -- not to be confused with
the announcement he made on 'The Late Show with David Letterman' in March or his 'Straight Talk Express' tour two weeks
later."

Full story: http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/04/25/crowley.mccain/index.html

* From advanced excerpts of McCain's remarks:

"I'm not the youngest candidate.  But I am the most experienced.  I know how the military works, what it can do, what
it can do better, and what it should not do.  I know how Congress works, and how to make it work for the country and
not just the re-election of its members. I know how the world works.  I know the good and the evil in it."

PROGRAMMING NOTE: John McCain joins CNN's Larry King for an exclusive first interview after officially entering the
presidential race. LKL, 9 pm ET.

* "Following his decision to step down from the House Intelligence Committee after the FBI raided his business last
week in Arizona, Rep. Rick Renzi (R-AZ) is temporarily stepping down from the Resources and Financial Services
Committees." (The Hill)

Also, "federal investigators in Arizona faced unexpected obstacles in getting needed Justice Department approvals to
advance" the Renzi investigation. "The delays, which postponed key approvals in the case until after the election,
raise new questions about whether Attorney General Alberto Gonzales or other officials may have weighed political
issues in some investigations." (Wall Street Journal)

* Speaking of the AG... "According to C-SPAN, 'Gonzales: the Hearing' garnered more than a quarter of a million live
video and audio streams, shattering previous C-SPAN records." (Roll Call)

* In New Hampshire yesterday, "Rudy Giuliani said if a Democrat is elected president in 2008, America will be at risk
for another terrorist attack on the scale of Sept. 11, 2001. But if a Republican is elected, he said, especially if it
is him, terrorist attacks can be anticipated and stopped." (The Politico)

* And forget the wrath of Rahm... Rep. Robert Wexler (D-FL) may have another reason to regret that Stephen
Colbert-inspired cocaine-is-a-fun-thing-to-do remark.  Check out the story in Hot Topics below!

President's Schedule:

* The president and Mrs. Bush make remarks on Malaria Awareness Day in the Rose Garden at 1:15 pm ET.  Later, President
Bush participates in a 3:15 pm ET meeting on financial literacy in the Roosevelt Room.

Also on the Political Radar:

* Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) (9 am ET) and NM Gov. Bill Richardson (10 am ET) address the National Jewish Democratic
Council at the Almas Temple in Washington, DC.

* Law & Order's Sam Waterston speaks at the National Press Club at 12:30 pm ET about Unity08 - a group whose goal is to
elect a bipartisan presidential ticket.

* General David Petraeus and JCS Chairman General Peter Pace head to Capitol Hill for a 2 pm ET closed briefing with
members of the House, and a 4 pm ET closed briefing with Senators.

(Today's top political stories from news organizations across the country)

BUSH AND CHENEY CALL OUT DEMS FOR "POLITICAL OPPORTUNISM": In separate appearances that served as a prelude to an
inevitable veto showdown, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney accused Democrats of political opportunism in forging ahead with a
$124 billion measure that sets a timetable for leaving Iraq. "Instead of fashioning a bill I could sign, the Democratic
leaders chose to further delay funding our troops, and they chose to make a political statement," Mr. Bush said Tuesday
morning before leaving for New York. "That's their right. But it is wrong for our troops and it's wrong for our
country." Mr. Cheney was even tougher as he spoke to reporters after a private weekly lunch for Republican senators. He
lashed out at Senator Harry Reid of Nevada... "What's most troubling about Senator Reid's comments yesterday is his
defeatism," said Mr. Cheney. "And the timetable legislation that he is now pursuing would guarantee defeat. Maybe it is
a political calculation."  New York Times: Bush and Cheney Chide Democrats on Iraq Deadline
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/25/washington/25cong.html

DEMS OFFER TOUGH LANGUAGE, NIXON COMPARISONS FOR BUSH: Emboldened congressional Democrats have turned up their rhetoric
when talking about President Bush, comparing him to Richard M. Nixon and using sharp language that conjures up images
of secluded dictators. "The president's in his bunker on both the war in Iraq and Attorney General Gonzales," Sen.
Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, said yesterday. "What everyone else sees clearly he doesn't see at all, and
that's a real problem for our country." Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada advanced the same idea, saying:
"The president is as isolated, I believe, on the Iraq issue as Richard Nixon was when he was hunkered down in the White
House." Rep. Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the Democratic caucus, has labeled Mr. Bush's war strategy the
"fairy tales and rose-colored glasses plan for Iraq." Washington Times: Democrats hone adjectives to vilify Bush
http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20070424-104649-3278r.htm

TILLMAN FAMILY, LYNCH DECRY PENTAGON PR: The Pentagon lied to create heroes from Iraq and Afghanistan, former Army
private first class Jessica Lynch and the brother of former NFL star and Army Ranger Pat Tillman told a House committee
Tuesday. Kevin Tillman, who served in a Ranger unit with his brother, and Lynch testified as part of the House
Oversight and Government Reform Committee's investigation into inaccurate accounts of the battlefield actions of Lynch
and Tillman. Army Spc. Bryan O'Neal, who had been in a nearby convoy when Tillman was killed by "friendly fire,"
testified that he was ordered not to tell Kevin Tillman how his brother died on April 22, 2004. Lynch was badly wounded
in Iraq in 2003; Pat Tillman, a corporal, was killed in Afghanistan. USA Today: Accounts of Lynch, Tillman cases called
'fiction' http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20070425/a_tillman25.art.htm

"PARTISAN WITCH HUNT" OR "OVERDUE" RETURN TO OVERSIGHT? Over the course of only 15 minutes today, three congressional
committees will consider subpoenas for half a dozen officials from the White House and the departments of Justice and
State. On the list is former presidential chief of staff Andrew H. Card Jr., Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and
former Justice Department liaison to the White House Monica M. Goodling, a key figure in the controversial firing of
eight U.S. attorneys. Republican leaders call it a "partisan witch hunt." But Democratic lawmakers, and even some
Republicans, say it is an overdue return to their constitutional role of executive-branch oversight. Since Democrats
assumed control of Congress in January, they have hired more than 200 investigative staffers for key watchdog
committees. They include lawyers, former reporters and congressional staffers who left oversight committees that had
all but atrophied during the six years that the GOP controlled Congress and the White House. Washington Post: Revival
of Oversight Role Sought http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/24/AR2007042402439.html

KUCINICH INTROS ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT FOR CHENEY: After hinting for weeks that he would initiate impeachment actions
against the Bush administration, Cleveland Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich [Tuesday] introduced articles of impeachment
against Vice President Dick Cheney. Kucinich said Congress should oust Cheney from office for purposely fabricating
intelligence in the runup to the Iraq war, thereby deceiving some in Congress and the public into believing war was
necessary. He also said Cheney manipulated intelligence about purported links between Saddam Hussein's Iraq and
al-Qaida, the group responsible for 9/11. And more recently, said Kucinich, unveiling his three articles of impeachment
at a news conference across from the Capitol, Cheney threatened aggression against Iran when Iran has not threatened
the United States. Plain Dealer politics blog: Kucinich: Cheney deceived Americans and must be impeached

ROBOCALL "SHENANIGANS": State investigators here are still trying to figure out who sabotaged Scott Kleeb's campaign
for Congress last November with a barrage of automated telephone calls to voters. The unauthorized calls, officials
said, distorted Mr. Kleeb's views and even used a recording of his voice - sometimes arriving in the middle of the
night - with the greeting: "Hi, this is Scott Kleeb!" Several Nebraska state lawmakers were so outraged by the
shenanigans that they are pushing legislation that would impose some of the country's most restrictive regulations on
prerecorded campaign calls, both bogus and legitimate ones. Similar bills are in the works in Florida, Michigan,
Missouri, Wisconsin and at least a dozen other states, prompted in large part by telephone calls authorized by
campaigns during last year's elections. New York Times: States Seek Limits on 'Robocalls' in Campaigns
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/25/us/politics/25calls.html

RENZI STEPS DOWN FROM MORE COMMITTEE POSTS: In another sign that Rep. Rick Renzi (R) is facing a political crisis, the
Arizonan removed himself Tuesday from his two remaining committee seats as well as a program run by the National
Republican Congressional Committee used to raise money for incumbents in competitive districts. Renzi is under federal
investigation, and a family business owned by his wife was raided Thursday by the FBI. While it has been known since at
least October 2006 that Renzi was under a preliminary investigation, few details of the probe had been made public. The
Wall Street Journal first reported Saturday that Renzi is facing scrutiny for allegedly trying to engineer a federal
land swap by pressuring a local mining business, Resolution Copper, to buy land owned by a friend and business
associate, James Sandlin. In a statement Tuesday, Renzi denied any wrongdoing. "For several weeks, I have been the
subject of leaked stories, conjecture, and false attacks about a land exchange. None of them bear any resemblance to
the truth," he said. Roll Call: Renzi Drops 2 Panels http://www.rollcall.com/issues/52_114/news/18172-1.html

DOJ DENIES "FOOT-DRAGGING" IN RENZI CASE: As midterm elections approached last November, federal investigators in
Arizona faced unexpected obstacles in getting needed Justice Department approvals to advance a corruption investigation
of Republican Rep. Rick Renzi, people close to the case said. The delays, which postponed key approvals in the case
until after the election, raise new questions about whether Attorney General Alberto Gonzales or other officials may
have weighed political issues in some investigations. The Arizona U.S. attorney then overseeing the case, Paul
Charlton, was told he was being fired in December, one of eight federal prosecutors dismissed in the past year. The
dismissals have triggered a wave of criticism and calls from Congress for Mr. Gonzales to resign. Investigators
pursuing the Renzi case had been seeking clearance from senior Justice Department officials on search warrants,
subpoenas and other legal tools for a year before the election, people close to the case said. The Justice Department
denied any foot-dragging in the Renzi case. Wall Street Journal: Delays in Renzi Case Raise More Gonzales Questions
http://wsj.com/link/renzi_gonzales

"LUKEWARM STATEMENT OF SUPPORT" FOR AG: Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa issued a lukewarm statement of support
on Tuesday night for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, declining to call for him to step down but saying that he has
"mixed feelings" about Gonzales keeping his job. Gonzales is taking heat from both Republican and Democratic members of
Congress in connection with the firings of eight U.S. attorneys. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week,
Grassley demanded to know why Gonzales kept changing his story on why the prosecutors were dismissed. Grassley had said
he wanted to hear Gonzales speak before he made a decision on whether to continue supporting him. President Bush since
the hearing has expressed his confidence in Gonzales. Des Moines Register: Gonzales has tepid support of Grassley

WILL CBC CONTINUE WITH FOX DEBATE? Members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) are pushing their leadership to
withdraw from an agreement with Fox News to sponsor  a Democratic presidential primary debate on Sept. 23 in Detroit.
Spurred by liberal activist groups such as MoveOn.org, the three Democratic presidential frontrunners, Sens. Hillary
Rodham Clinton (N.Y.) and Barack Obama (Ill.) and former Sen. John Edwards (N.C.), have withdrawn from the debate,
citing what they call Fox News's conservative bias. "I do think that the CBC should seriously consider pulling out
because Fox almost always chooses the opposite position of our caucus and members are continuously badmouthed on
there," a member of the black caucus, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), said. "That would be my position inside the caucus.
However, I in the final analysis would support the caucus's decision." The Hill: CBC is split over quitting debate on
Fox http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/cbc-is-split-over-quitting-debate-on-fox-2007-04-24.html

UNEXPECTED UNDERDOG: Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., today will officially enter the 2008 race for the White House. That's
no surprise. He's essentially been running for months. What is a surprise is that McCain, 70, for the second time finds
himself the Republican underdog. While candidate McCain in 2000 was a rowdy anti-establishment maverick who outpaced
expectations, this time he is running an underachieving, traditional, deliberative campaign. As he arrives in New
Hampshire for today's announcement, McCain is the No. 1 spokesman for President Bush's politically unpopular Iraq war.
He is No. 2 in national polls of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents, behind front-running former New York City
Mayor Rudy Giuliani. His $13.1 million first-quarter fundraising total was lethargic compared with the other top-tier
Republican and Democratic candidates. Many allies and supporters of his 2000 effort have abandoned him. Arizona
Republic: McCain takes new tack http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/0425mccain-main0425.html

THE AGE QUESTION: Senator John McCain has backpacked down one side of the Grand Canyon and up the other. When he's in
Washington, he works as many as 16 hours a day, sometimes seven days a week -- then does the same on the campaign
trail. Displays of stamina may be commonplace over next 18 months for the 70-year-old Arizona Republican, who plans to
formally announce today that he is running for president. As the oldest candidate in the race, McCain is laboring to
allay concerns about his age -- an issue that, along with his unwavering support of the Iraq war, may be his biggest
obstacle. If elected in 2008, McCain would become, at 72, the oldest man ever to assume the presidency. The current
record-holder, Ronald Reagan, was 69 when he took office in 1981. Bloomberg: McCain Seeks `Antidote' to Age Concerns as
He Launches Campaign http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&sid=a7v17AWyz5us

UNTIL RECENTLY, OBAMA GAVE "COMPARATIVELY LITTLE" TO CHARITY: Giving, service and compassion are recurrent themes on
the campaign trail for Sen. Barack Obama, but the Democratic presidential contender has only recently dug deep into his
own pockets to support charitable causes. Obama has enjoyed a robust household income throughout his political career
in the Illinois Senate and the U.S. Senate. But for most of that time he has reported comparatively little by national
standards in charitable contributions on his tax returns, records released by Obama show. Chicago Tribune: For Obama,
charity really began in the U.S. Senate http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-0704250022apr25,1,1209388.story


OBAMA SAYS COMMITMENT TO ISRAEL'S SECURITY IS UNWAVERING: Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama on Tuesday
tried to reassure Jewish voters concerned about his Muslim ties, arguing that his commitment to Israel's security is
unwavering. Speaking to the National Jewish Democratic Council, the Illinois senator said his experience living in
Indonesia for four years as a child and his ability to speak to Muslims could make him a better president. "If I go to
Jakarta and address the largest Muslim country on earth, I can say, 'Apa kabar,' - you know, 'How are you doing?' - and
they can recognize that I understand their common humanity," Obama said. "That is a strength, and it allows me to say
things to them that other presidents might not be able to say. And that's part of what's promising, I think, about this
presidency." Obama's stepfather was Indonesian, and the future senator lived in the country from ages 6 to 10. AP via

RUDY WARNS OF NEW ATTACKS: Rudy Giuliani said if a Democrat is elected president in 2008, America will be at risk for
another terrorist attack on the scale of Sept. 11, 2001. But if a Republican is elected, he said, especially if it is
him, terrorist attacks can be anticipated and stopped. "If any Republican is elected president —- and I think obviously
I would be the best at this —- we will remain on offense and will anticipate what [the terrorists] will do and try to
stop them before they do it," Giuliani said. The Politico: Giuliani warns of 'new 9/11' if Dems win

DODD "FRUSTRATED" BY LACK OF ATTENTION: [Sen. Chris] Dodd is struggling to be heard in a primary race dominated by
Senators Hillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois. Only former senator John Edwards of North Carolina
has managed to match Clinton and Obama in headlines on occasion -- even though the Democratic field includes one
senator in addition to Dodd, a former senator, a highly popular governor with a golden resume, and a well-known
representative who's a darling of the far-left. After a visit last week to a fire station in Nashua, Dodd was met with
silence when he asked whether any of the firefighters had questions for him. "It's a chance to pick on the senator," he
said, egging them on, but still elicited no response. Boston Globe: Out of spotlight, Dodd runs on hope

MORE COLBERT-RELATED PROBLEMS FOR WEXLER: Shocking news out of Florida! Nearly nine months after Rep. Robert Wexler (D)
said that cocaine and prostitutes are fun things to do, someone wants to take the lawmaker's job. Imagine that! No one
in the political world has forgotten Wexler's comments to Comedy Central's Stephen Colbert last summer, especially
Democrat Ben Graber, who announced last week he is challenging the sixth-term incumbent in the 2008 primary.  Graber,
an OB/GYN doctor who has held political offices in Florida, told Under the Dome yesterday that the comments were not
themselves the reason why he got into the race. But will he be using the Wexler-Colbert interview as political ammo on
the campaign trail? Oh, yeah. Graber, who is apparently not the kind of guy to let a gag go unpunished, suggested
Wexler may not have been joking when, egged on by Colbert, he looked into the camera and said he enjoys cocaine and
prostitutes "because it's a fun thing to do." The Hill: Wexler cocaine comment may haunt him
