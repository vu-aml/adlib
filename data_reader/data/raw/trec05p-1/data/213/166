The city has set up a number that will help direct your request.  I haven't tried it but if you dial 311 it will connect you with the Houston Service Helpline and they will direct you to the correct department to file a complaint.

To whom should one complain (if appeals to the owner fail) about renegade shrubbery that has overgrown a sidewalk?

Sound is right...I heard him barking this morning again. I guess he was calling out to Indy to see if he could come out to play.

is his dog missing? I had to take that puppy to the spca cause he was an escape artist 
somebody told me that a family had taken this dog in for about a week, but it kept getting out and they didn't want the responsibility anymore

That could be "Zorro" - he lives at 904 Bomar - Gary is his dad.
