> A Mexican is strolling down the street in Mexico City and kicks a
> bottle laying in the street. Suddenly out of the bottle comes a Genie.
> (yall know the routine!!)
> The Mexican is stunned and the Genie says, "Hello master, I will grant you
>
> one wish, anything you want." The Mexican begins thinking, "Well.....I
> really like drinking tequila." Finally the Mexican says, "I wish to drink
> tequila whenever I want, so make me piss tequila........"
> The Genie grants him his wish. When the Mexican gets home he gets a
> glass out of the cupboard and pisses in it. He looks at the glass and it's
>
> clear.  Looks like tequila....  Then he smells the liquid. Smells like
> tequila.
> So, he takes a taste and it is the best tequila he has ever
> tasted.............
> The Mexican yells to his wife,"Consuelo, Consuelo, come quickly!"
> She comes running down the hall and the Mexican takes another glass
> out of the cupboard and pisses into it........
> He tells her to drink, it is tequila. Consuelo is reluctant but goes
> ahead and takes a sip. It is the best tequila she has ever
> tasted..........
> The two drink and party all night. The next night the Mexican comes
> home from work and tells his wife to get two glasses out of the cupboard.
> He proceeds to piss in the two glasses. The result is the same, the
> tequila
> is excellent and the couple drink until the sun comes up........
> Finally Friday night comes and the Mexican comes home and tells his
> wife, "Consuelo grab one glass from the cupboard and we will drink
> tequila.........
> His wife gets the glass from the cupboard and sets it on the table.
> The Mexican begins to piss in the glass and when he fills it his wife asks
>
> him........,
> "But Pancho, why do we need only one glass?" Pancho raised the glass
> and says..........., "Because tonight my love, you drink from the
> bottle!!!
