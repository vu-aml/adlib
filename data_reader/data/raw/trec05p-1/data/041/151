Carole Migden indicated that they were going to meet again on Tuesday.  I
followed up with Keith prior to Appropriations and he was very disappointed
that he and Bill Leonard could not round up more votes. They knew the
liberals would make a play and thought on a policy level they were better
off pushing a better bill than allowing a bad bill to go through along party
lines.  However, Republicans are well aware of the polling and think this
issue is better left to the Democrats.  Perhaps the liberal play will
energize Republican members.  As for moving to the left, it did not appear
as if Hertzberg was moving left because the amendments seemed to be offered
without his consent which is why the hearing was stopped so abruptly.  If in
fact they are going to stay left and the amendments they presented this
morning wind up in the bill, what does Enron think?  I have already
forwarded the DA amendments to Jeff, Jim and Mike Day.  I will send the
additional amendments momentarily.

Thanks, Scott.  Though the chances of re-kindling a bi-partisan,
centrist deal among Rs, Ds and Davis are extremely small.  Richmond
(Republican leading Assembly efforts) has agreed to stay in touch with
Bev over the weekend in the very unlikely event that something rekindles
between Rs and Ds.  In the meantime, with Davis and the Assembly Ds
drifting back to the left, we'll need to redouble our own efforts to
make sure we don't lose the ground we've gained.  Scott, are they
meeting again on  Monday, or Tuesday?

Best,
Jeff

The Assembly Appropriations Committee canceled the SBX2 78 hearing
mid-way
through the presentation by Senator Polanco.  As Hedy indicated before,
with
the Republicans not willing to vote for the bill, liberal Democrats
crafted
11 new amendments which they felt were necessary in order to garner
their
votes.  Clearly there was no consensus among committee members or
leadership
on the amendments in question and the business community was up in arms.
Amid the confusion, Hertzberg effectively ordered the hearing canceled.
They intend to hear the bill again on Monday.
