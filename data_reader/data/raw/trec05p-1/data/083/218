Hi Jennifer,

There was some discussion of this, but I haven't agreed to pay for the damage, as it was caused by a 3rd party contractor. When I was at the house I mentioned the damage to company that's responsible, and told them that we'd follow up for reparations.

If you'll forward the invoice (a copy will be fine) I'll try and run this down and see that it's taken care of. 

Please send via interoffice -- I'm at EB2241

Thanks!

Paige

Paige,

Some time ago Jeff had some wiring done at his home for use of his company laptop.  As you may recall there were some problems where the wiring was placed the first time and Jeff had to have his contractor come out and do repairs.  We had discussed your group reimbursing or paying for the repairs and the invoice has made it to my desk today.  Please let me know how you would like to proceed with this.

Thanks,
Jennifer
