Covington will backup Jon Kitna this week. However, Covington is not worth using even if he receives playing time. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

"There are concerns," coach Jeff Fisher said. "He hasn't responded like we'd hoped. He's still pretty stiff." McNair first experienced some stiffness in his lower back late last w!
ee!
k. In the first quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay, he said the muscles tightened up. However, he stayed in the game and led the Titans to a 26-20 victory. Even McNair is unsure of his status for Saturday night. "If it's like it is right now, there's no way I can do it," he said. "I'm very surprised. Usually this comes and goes, but this time the spasms have stayed longer than I anticipated." Avoid using McNair this week if you have a backup of equal value. His health status makes him a major risk.   </FONT>

Jackson, a rookie, who leads the team with 554 yards rushing, will miss the rest of the season with an ankle injury. He aggravated a left ankle sprain in the first quarter of Sunday's defeat against the Jacksonville Jaguars and left the game with two carries for 6 yards. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White will share carries in his absence, but neither are reliable players to use during the Fantasy playoffs.   </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3856&key=1329&"><B>Shannon Sharpe</B></A>, TE BAL - Orange Roughy <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/20/01</FONT><BR>
