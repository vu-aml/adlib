REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP

I am DR.DEZI DANIELS, of Procurement and contract Award committee panel with 
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) of the federal Republic of
Nigeria.
I got your contact from the foreign office of the Nigerian Chambers of
Commerce and Industry.
It is with trust that I wish to contact you on this matter concerning the
transfer of US$15million Dollars.
Sometime ago, a contract was awarded by my Corporation (NNPC) to Alliance
Oil International, to Service,
Turn Around Maintenance and Rehabilitation Work on Kaduna Refinery and
Petrochemical Company (KWRPC) Plant in Nigeria.
This contract was over-invoiced by us. Myself and some officials reached a
compromise to transfer the Fund into Foreign Bank account that will
accommodate this Fund. We have all modalities set.We have been disappointed
some years ago by a British man,Mr.franklin whom we trusted with a
transaction of this
nature up to the tune of US$2million US Dollars. He is sitting on our money
for no apparent reason but we are willing to try again but we believe that
for his act of wickedness to us,
he will never go unpunished by God. Because of this we are afraid and we
need your total trust and assurance that you must be an honest and
straightforward person.
We have agreed to share the money thus:
(1). 20% for the account owner.
(2). 75% for me and my partners
(3). 5% to be used in offsetting taxes and all local &
foreign expenses.
Please, note that this transaction is 100% safe and
risk free and we will commence the transaction from
the date of receipt of the following information via
e-mail.
Please if you accept this proposal, send to me by
e-mail.
(1). Your personal telephone and fax numbers.
(2). Your Bank name, address, telephone, fax as well as your Bank Account
numbers.or you open a new account for this business, With these
information, we are going to put in application for the release of this
fund into your account for us all. Due to our sensitive position, we can
not afford a slip in this transaction so contact me immediately through my
e-email address for further information on the
requirements and procedure for this transaction.
Please treat with the strictest confidentiality and utmost urgency.

Yours faithfully,
DR. DEZI DANIELS

please reply to;

dezidan@k.ro
