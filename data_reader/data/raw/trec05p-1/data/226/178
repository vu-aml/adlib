Attached is the system check plan that Hasan provided to us for the morning checks.  Please take a look at it and work with Hasan on any modifications that may need to be made.  Once the plan has been adjusted, if necessary, just send us a copy.

 

Thanks,
Chris

Problems in accessing mailman.enron.com does not mean external mail is not working.  We are sending notices currently.   Maybe we should sent an external email to test this portion vs. accessing the admin application for external ID's.  I believe sending an email to our skytel (Blackberrys) accounts would work for the test.  

 If you have any questions, please let me know.   Thanks.  Jean

All testing was completed, but we encountered problems with accessing mailman.enron.com.  We opened a problem ticket with the Resolution Center, and they are looking into it.  They will update us as they have more information.   We have confirmed with the ENW Resolution Center that the Exchange servers are up.
