Does the new PRC Rankings Policy of only the top 10% and the bottom 10% will be reviewed by the Enron Office of the Chairman mean that only the top 10% of employees will be considered for promotions? Will the bottom 10% be asked to leave the company, if yes, then will we stick to it at all levels, especially Sr. Dir, VP & MD?
