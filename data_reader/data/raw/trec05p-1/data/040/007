Rick:

Please find attached the presentation on the Technical International Regulatory Support.  I hope that you agree with its style of "less is more"; of course I can change it very quickly if needed.   

As you can see from the email below, Guillermo has already started the process in Brazil; it seems to be a popular idea with Sergio.

Please let me know if you have any question.
