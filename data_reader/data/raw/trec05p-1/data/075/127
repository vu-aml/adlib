Dear Beloved Friend,
I am Barr;bentley kingsley, a legal practitioner, I am
the personal attorney to Mr David Via ,a
nationale of your country, who used to work with
Chevron Nigeria limited,here in Nigeria. On the 27th
of January 2002, my client,his wife and their three
children were involved in Ikeja bomb blast here in my
country. My client and his family unfortunately lost
there lives.
 
PLEASE VIEW THESE WEBSITES BELOW TO CONFIRM

Since then I have made several enquiries to your
embassy to locate any of my clients extended
relatives,this has also proved unsuccessful. After
these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided and do
some research in the internet, to locate any member of
his family. That is why I contacted you,and the reason
why i contacted you is to assist me in repatriating
the money and property left behind by my client before
they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the
bank where these huge deposits were lodged where my
client deposited US$17.4million dollars.
 
The Bank has issued me a notice to provide the next of
kin or have the Account confiscated within the next
ten official working days. Since I have been
unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 2
Years now I seek your consent to present you as the
next of kin of the deceased, so that the proceeds of
this account valued at US$17.4million dollars can be
transferred to your account there in your country,
then you and me can share the money. I have all
necessary legal documents that back up the claim we
may make. All I require is your honest co-operation
to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that
this will be executed under legitimate arrangement
that will protect you from any breach of the law.
Please indicate your readiness to assist me,so that
all the informations about this funds will be passed
to you immediately.You should send to me your full
names, your private telephone numbers,fax number
date of birth emlpoyment status, for easy
communications.And also assure me of your trust
and remember that the trust in business is
confidentiality.So let it be only between me and
you.If you give me your full coperation and this
transaction is properly executed,I am prepared to give
you 30% of the total sum for your kind assistance.60%
will be for me and 10% percent will be for any
expences we may incure along in this
transaction.Please get in touch with me by my private
email below to enable us discuss further.
 
Thank you very much for your understanding.
Best Regards,
Barr
