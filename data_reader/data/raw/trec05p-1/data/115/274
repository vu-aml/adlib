Hey Lindy -

I haven't seen or talked to you in a while.  It will be fun to
(potentially) work with you and Lorraine again -- I can at least treat you
guys to a couple of good lunches!

Next Friday will be fine for me.  I am out of town through Thursday, but
open all next Friday - so just let me know if something on the 9th would
work for ya'll -

I think there are five potential deal areas on the table:

1.  Restructure existing ECS deals (bisti, bloomfield, gallup-switch from
MTM to accrual, hubbard, WT1)
2.  Increase netback from Gallup demand management (up to $2MM/year);
possibly MTM the remaining balance?
3.  New ECS/EES deals
4.  RCM Project -- $20 MM to $100 MM guaranteed incremental cashflow and
earnings for GPG in 2002
5.  ETS Trading/Risk Management Project - use SCADA data for incremental
earnings creation through trading/risk management


See you then.


Dave

Dave,
     How are you?  I hope all is going well with your new job.  I'm
sorry we won't be able to meet this Friday.  Can I call or e:mail you to
set-up another time?

I'll look forward to seeing you soon.

Thanks,
Lindy

Dave,
     If possible, I would like for you to sit down with Lindy and a few
folks from our group who have been looking at this. I want to make sure
that it would be an efficient use of your time and that we would not be
duplicating anything. I will have Lindy contact you so we can set
something
up and then move forward as necessary. Thanks.
     Steve

   Steve -

   I worked it out so you will be getting the lowest possible rate for
my
   time, $175/hour (normal rate is $350).  I would like to send you an
   engagement letter this week for up to 3 weeks or 120 hours ($21k).  I
   think
   we can get it done in less time but the 120 hours provides some
   flexibility
   if we decide to go deeper on something -- we would only charge you
for
   the
   hours we use.

   I am visualizing the deliverable as an analysis of your restructuring
   options as well as the NPV, Income, and operational effect for each.
To
   the extent time allows, I will be able to help negotiate and close
   whatever
   option you choose.

   In order for me to offer our preferred rate, it is important to note
   that I
   would need to be able to do this project on somewhat of a flexible
basis
   (e.g. Friday meetings, emails, and phone vs. being on-site 3 weeks
   full-time).  Even with this flexible structure, I feel confident that
we
   can have the deliverable complete by mid December.

   Please let me know if it is ok to draw up an engagement letter with
   these
   terms.


   ========================

   As for the new idea ----

   I have been spending much of my time lately helping merchant power
   generators think about ways to leverage the value of their asset
   position/market intelligence.  It occurred to me that there is an
   analogy
   here that relates to pipelines.

   Pipelines have operational "events" that may have  market effects:
       Unplanned outage  (major/minor/duration/notice)
      Planned outages over a certain volume
      Operation flow order/ SOLs
      Key Plants backed in
      Takes over schedule volumes key points
      Linepack levels
      Pressure drops at key points

   Since the pipeline is exposed to gas prices through  gas needed for
   operational purchases - it is rationale that these phenomena would
be
   studied and acted (read traded) upon in order to minimize TW's market
   risk
   (read generate income).  TW can setup a risk management group to
execute
   this idea. It is not unusual for a pipeline to  have a risk
management
   function -  Duke Pipeline for example has a VP of  Risk Management
for
   Pipelines.

   These "events" would be studied in the follow way -

   1. Determine whether there is a correlation between  an  "event" and
gas
   prices/basis differentials. - based on historical  data.
   2.  For those events that have a strong  correlations, develop a
trading
   strategy around the relationship.
   3.  Back-test the trading strategy against  historical data -
determine
   profitability.
   4.  For operational "events" that are  applicable, setup a system to
   execute program trading that is directly linked to  SCADA.


   Secondary benefits of this risk management (trading) strategy, would
be
   developing the expertise to make decisions related to benefits of
   selling
   the capacity physical vs. through basis derivatives. (or some
   combination
   of both)

   Steve, if you are interested in this idea I can  start drawing up a
   workplan for this study.

   Steve -

    I have some ideas related to ECS contract restructuring options.  If
   your
   team is available I could come by next Friday mid-morning or later
to
   start discussing  with them.

   On the administrative side, I am working to nail down the lowest
hourly
   rate I can get for you.  I would probably propose something like 80
   hours *
   rate, in the engagement letter.  This amount of time should be
adequate
   to
   put together a short study on your different options.  I will send
you a
   engagement letter this week.  I would just need to get that signed by
   you
   before Friday.

   Also, please let me know if you need any other information on the
   Reliability Centered Maintenance idea, as you prepare to talk to the
   other
   officers.

      Hello Steve -

      Haven't talked to you in a while, hope all is well.  A quick
update -
   I
      moved over from EES to Accenture's Energy group about six months
ago
   and
      have been focusing on Trading and Risk Management & Pipeline
      Optimization
      projects.

      I had an idea which I thought you might find interesting.
Accenture
   has
      a
      strategic alliance with a technology provider for Reliability
   Centered
      Maintenance (RCM) -- basically an advanced methodology &
technology
   for
      making maintenance decisions.  They are the standard for electric
T&D
      companies and are now trying to move over into the pipeline
segment.
      This
      is how I was thinking about using them to structure a deal:


      1.  TW hires Accenture to implement RCM
      2.  RCM Benefits are determined by a pilot project (4 weeks)
      3.  Accenture pays TW upfront for 10 years of projected benefits
from
      RCM
      (say $20MM) as part of our "guarantee"
      4.  TW pays Accenture an annual licensing fee for the use of RCM
over
      the
      next 10 years which will flow into the next rate case.

      I am currently pursuing another project with Ben Asante, so I am
   around
      the
      Enron building.  Let me know if you would like to get together to
      discuss
      further.

      Hope all is well.
