Based on the credit aggregation system, EPMI has purchased $3,914 from the pool however we show an invoice due EPMI (from SAP) i/a/o $21,419 resulting in a net payable to EPMI of $17,505 if the numbers are correct.
 
The SPP policy states that if a cp experiences a debt downgrade or negative watch, a cp must give SPP notice.  We need to give notice of downgrade/neg watch if we haven't done so already.

SPP is proposing a new credit policy which may affect our credit requirements.
 
I have already informed Mike Carson, who will be analyzing the commercial implications.
 
In the mean time, to expedite things, I am also sending you the new SPP Credit Policy.
 
Tks

Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP) continues to make changes to its Credit 
Policy to reflect changes in overall market conditions. The current Credit 
Policy was posted on our web site on November 14, 2001. It reflects a marked 
shift in the way SPP has administered its Credit Policy in the past. 

SPP wants all of our customers to be made aware of this change and we want 
to give each  a certain period of time to make the necessary adjustments in 
any areas that may be necessary. To this end SPP is attaching the new Credit 
Policy for your review. We ask that it be directed to the proper person 
within your organization to assure that your company is compliant with all 
conditions of the Credit Policy. We ask that you also complete the attached 
Credit Agreement and return it to SPP as soon as possible. 

SPP expects all customers to be compliant with the Credit Policy by December 
15, 2001. Please review the Credit Policy and take the necessary steps to be 
in compliance by that date so that there are no interruptions of service or 
your ability to make future reservations. 

If you have any questions concerning the new policy please feel free to 
contact me.  I look forward to working with you to make these changes as 
smooth as possible.
