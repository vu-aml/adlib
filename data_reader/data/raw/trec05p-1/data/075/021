Re:         Employment Training Funds Available to CMTA Members

2001 has been a trying year for many of our members.  The national
economic slowdown has been compounded here in the state as a result of
energy issues and 'California-only' mandates on employers.

One way CMTA is helping companies offset the state's high cost of doing
business is by offering a free program to help acquire state funds for
their employment training needs.

Please take a moment to go to our ETP program webpage at
http://www.cmta.net/member/etpmrktg.shtml to see how you might be
able to take advantage of these services.
