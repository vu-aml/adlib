Subject: FW: I have learned



I've Learned...... 
I've learned that, no matter what happens, how bad it seems today, life does 
go on and it will be better tomorrow. 

I've learned that you can tell a lot about a person by the way he/she 
handles three things: 
 1. A rainy day, 
 2. Lost luggage, 
 3. Tangled Christmas tree lights. 

I've learned that, regardless of your relationship with your parents, you'll 
miss them when they're gone from your life. 

I've learned that making a "living" is not the same thing as making a 
"life." 

I've learned that life sometimes gives you a second chance. 

I've learned that you shouldn't go through life with a catcher's mitt on 
both hands. You need to be able to throw something back. 

I've learned that if you pursue happiness, it will elude you. But, if you 
focus on your family, your friends, the needs of others, your work and doing 
the very best you can, happiness will find you. 

 I've learned that whenever I decide something with an open heart, I usually 
make the right decision. 

I've learned that even when I have pains, I don't have to be one. 

I've learned that every day, you should reach out and touch someone. People 
love that human touch - holding hands, a warm hug, or just a friendly pat on 
the back. 

People will forget what you said ... people will forget what you did, but 
people will never forget how you made them feel. 

I've learned that I still have a lot to learn. 

I've learned that you should pass this on to everyone you care about. 

I just did. 

Sometimes they just need a little something to make them smile.
