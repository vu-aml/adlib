As part of the ongoing effort to enhance the iPayit AP process and software, a committee will be created whose purpose will be to manage future iPayit process/product changes.  The iPayit enhancement review committee will be made up of Enron representatives from multiple business units who will act as the primary voice of their respective organizations.  Please provide me with the names of 1-2 possible candidates from your organization who may be a good fit for the team.  Once the team has been identified, a kick-off meeting will be held.  Below are some specifics regarding duties of the committee and team member characteristics.  

Listed below are the primary responsibilities of this committee.
