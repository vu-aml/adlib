I have written the entries up, reviewed them with Greg and they will be posted today before I leave.  Let me know if you have any other questions.
Thanks,

That's fine, the numbers I was using came from Carol.  The journal entries did get made, correct?  Let me know.

Chris,
Wanted to let you know that the investment in Kachine/Gallup is $1,775,144.85, not $1,742,855.41.  This will reduce the net gain to $324,158.15.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Karen

Karen,

Per our discussion, you will find attached the letter that Jean is going to sign.  According to the numbers showed to me by Carol earlier this week, we should expect to book a gain of $356,447.59 as a result of doing this (calculations below).  Please review and let me know if you have any comments.  I will deliver you the signed letter when I get it along with the detailed calculations.

Attached is the notice letter to EMP ECHO, LLC for ECS' election to take and make the distributions resulting from the payment of the note for Gallup and Kachina.  As we discussed Chris, Section 5.03 of the LLC Agreement governs the distributions and assuming the requirements of that section are met and upon provision of this notice, the note proceeds can be distributed to ECS.  Upon payment of the note by whoever HPL's assignee is, the original notes will need to be cancelled.  Nora, can locate these originals.

I am not sure if the address and fax for EMP ECHO is correct.  I pulled these from the agreement.  Need to verify.
