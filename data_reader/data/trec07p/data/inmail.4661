That wasn't my question. I don't doubt that it is possible to get a
corrupt tdb file. What I am asking is if you have seen a corrupt tdb
file that causes a 'wild pointer', and presumably a crash in the tdb
code that is reading the file.

The patch you applied implied that you thought we might get a file
like that, and that disabling MMAP would avoid the segv. I shouldn't
matter if you have the contents of /dev/random in a tdb file, it
should not segv, no matter if using mmap or not (there is an exception
to this, where the file is truncated out from under a running program
accessing tdb via mmap - that is arguably a kernel bug, and is not
relevant to the situation you are trying to fix).

So if you do have a tdb file that when read using mmap causes a crash,
please give me a copy. It implies that we have a real bug.

Cheers, Tridge
