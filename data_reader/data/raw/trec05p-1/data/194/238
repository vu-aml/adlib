I tracked back through the HR names to see if I can get to 9. They would be:
 
Specialists
Neil Davies  - team lead
Kari Oquinn - comp
Tony Garrett - payroll and benefits
Karen Buckley - recruiting, A&A's, training and management reports
Generalists
Jeanie Slone - OTC, Gas Commercial teams, Denver, Mexico, New York
Amy Fitzpatrick - Power Commercial teams, Calgary and Portland
Mandy Curless - IT, Back office and support groups
 
Me
Julie Clyatt - group admin
 
Please bear in mind it would be imperative to make sure the following stay in estate for at least 90 days and help us with transition (ie not sure we can do everything we need to with above team):
 
*Tana Cashion - Generalist 
Sarah Zargowski - Generalist
Anne Labbe - Admin
*Julie Kearney - Portland/Calagry HR rep
Charles Philpot - HRIS
Tharsie Broussard - Comp reporting number 2.
 
Above are names I am suggesting come off list to get to 9.* names are one's ideally I'd like to add back.
