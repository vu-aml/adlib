MR DAVID CHANG.
HSBC International Trustee (Singapore) Limited
Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC)
21 Collyer Quay, #16-00 HSBC Building, 049320, Singapore.

Dear Sir,

I am Mr. David Chang, director of operations of the HSBC International 
Trustee (Singapore) Limited, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation 
(HSBC), 21 Collyer Quay, #16-00 HSBC Building, 049320, Singapore. I have an 
obscured business suggestion for you.

Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major General Khalid Al-Khalid who 
was with the Iraqi forces and also businessman made a numbered fixed deposit 
for 24 calendar months, with a value of Four million Five Hundred Thousand 
(U$D4.5M) United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several 
notices was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after 
the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. 
We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the 
war in bomb blast that hit their home.

After further investigation it was also discovered that Major General Khalid 
Al-Khalid did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including 
the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time 
he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. 
So, Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying 
in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me 
most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 
years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if 
nobody applies to claim the funds.

Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a 
foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major General Khalid Al-Khalid so 
that you will be able to receive his funds.

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall 
come out unsuccessful. I have contacted an attorney in London that will 
prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to 
Major General Khalid Al-Khalid, and file for claims to be reconciled in the 
UK. All that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me 
with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. 
After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for 
claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of 
probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be 
provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are 
going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the 
necessary documents.

Please endeavour to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this 
issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account 
we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30%for you, Should you be 
interested please send me your full names and current residential address 
and I will prefers you to reach me on this email address and finally after 
that I shall provide you with more details of this operation.

PLEASE!!! ALL RESPONSE AND CORRESPONDENCE BE SENT TO MY PRIVATE EMAIL 
ADDRESS:

My sincere regards,
David Chang
