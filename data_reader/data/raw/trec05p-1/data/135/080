Starting a few days ago, Lotus notes has been eliminated as a format for inputing schedule confirmation and cut schedule information.  The new process is done in Enpower.  Cara sent a notice out last week and I have left a copy of the new process instruction manual on the Real Time desk.  Please take the time to check it out.  For our purposes we will basically only need to read thru the Path Confirmation instructions.  I had a chance to test out this new process a few weeks ago and it is far better than Lotus Notes and works effectively.  If you have any questions feel free to ask Cara or myself.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.
