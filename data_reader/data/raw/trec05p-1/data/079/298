Tracy,
There is no detail of the O&M expense as has been requested.  I read Valerie's note about how they're not geared toward providing that because of their FERC COA vs. SAP.  The allocations page possibly, but they will likely need to provide their best estimate of all of the O&M detail.  However, given that their sale is pending, I don't know what level of scrutiny will be afforded to PGE's costs.  I will check with Lindsey, Butts, et.al. to see.

Also, their file is linked to all of their source files.  This is unacceptable - this exposes our model to linking complications (their file opens up with a manual calculation required to update the numbers) and causes rounding errors.  Please have them enter in their numbers as requested initially: $ in millions, to one decimal point in the cell (for example, a cell may reflect 4.5, but the cell actually contains 4.5211114598793546 because of the links --- we need the cell to reflect and contain just 4.5 .)

Call me and we'll discuss.

Thanks,
Steve

After reviewing the budget yesterday, we noticed that goodwill was still being
amortized in 2002. We need to take that out of your numbers. Jim and Kiri
thought it was approximately $14 million. Thus, PGG should have an IBIT of
$270. Please revise file and send back to me and copy Steve Schwarzbach
thanks.

Hi Tracy, 

Please see attached for the Plan that Stan Horton will be looking at tomorrow 
morning. This version includes Intercompany interest expense that was not 
previously budgeted. It also has a more detail break-out of capital 
expenditures. 

For the O&M detail pages, we will not be able to give you the same break-out 
for our cost as you have requested. Our GL is build on FERC accounts and is 
not condusive to SAP type sorting. 

Also, note that all O&M are at this point still straight lined for the year. 
The quarterly shaping of earnings will not be available until mid to late 
November. There will be significant swing between quarters from these results 
to the final one. 

Let me know if you have any questions.
