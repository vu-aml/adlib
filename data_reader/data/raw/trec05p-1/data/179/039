Coach Mike Holmgren said Wednesday that Hasselbeck aggravated the injury, which he's had since the third week of the season, against the New York Giants last Sunday.   "There's a chance I might have him and he could play in an emergency-type situation, but he's pretty sore," Holmgren said.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=3696&key=1116&"><B>James Stewart</B></A>, RB DET - Hunter <FONT SIZE=1>

Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB. <BR>

Allen is ready to assume a larger workload, says the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>. He may start against the Bengals this week. "I expect to see more time but I'm still not 100 percent," Allen said. "My hand is going to bother me but I need to be out there on the field to help this team."<BR>

Despite scoring on two short TD runs last week, Barlow is not offically the Niners' goal-line back, says the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. "It's a coincidence," Barlow said. "It was my turn in the rotation to be in there." The two backs will continue to split carries. <BR>

Fiedler threw for 149 yards, no TDs and was intercepted three times at San Francisco. The Miami QB is too erratic to be a regular starter for any Fantasy team during the playoffs.<BR>

The Lions held Carter to 30 yards on three catches. Still, the veteran receiver is too experienced and potentially productive to bench during any week of the Fantasy playoffs. <BR>

The explosive Holt is a must-start player in Week 14. He will be a regularly featured target for Kurt Warner on Monday Night Football. <BR>

Richey is likely to lose the starting placekicking job with the Chargers if they sign Steve Christie to a contract. San Diego would shift Richey to kickoffs only, after he missed two short field goals Sunday to drop to 21-for-30 on the season. In that case, you should drop Richey from your roster.<BR>

The Colts placed Pathon on injured reserve Tuesday with a damaged ligament in his right foot, effectively ending his season. He will undergo surgery in the near future, and you should cut him if you were holding onto him awaiting his return.<BR>

Cornerback Bobby Taylor missed practice on Wednesday with a quadriceps injury. He is expected to return to practice, however, and should be ready in time for Sunday's game against Dallas. <BR>
