Kevin:

Dave will wordsmith his California write-up and send the document to us.
Is the attached for IX. Summary Financial Data?
New Source Review: When we put in new engine, we have to go through New Source Review permitting process.  To get a permit, generally we have to install emission control equipment.  Some state agencies are now saying that when we do major maintenance on our existing engine, we have to go through the same process as installing a new engine.

Lindy, I believe you have the rest of Kevin's questions.

I have attached below the 5-year projection template required from Corporate.  I am working with Jim's group on the actuals.  We need to check classification between actuals and forecast to make sure we are consistent.  I am not sure we will have actuals before I leave today.  I need someone to help me out here if we need to make a change.  These numbers are straight from Davis' latest model.




   

Someone also needs to forward to Corp.  I think we are supposed to have all of this in today.
