VENTURE 
MARKET 
SUMMARY 

	It was a good day for Scion Photonics. The provider of technology for high-volume production of DWDM optical networking products told VentureWire it has closed the first part of its Series B financing at $33 million. It also named James R. Fultz, the former CEO of Zaffire, as its first president and CEO. Meanwhile, 10 other companies raised approximately $55 million, including UIEvolution, a developer of client-server architecture for wireless operators and service providers, that closed $7.7 million in its Series A.

But VentureWire also learned about some more bad news at Cinta Networks. The optical networking startup reduced its staff this week from just over 100 to about 70 in a second round of layoffs as a cost-cutting measure to help the company stay afloat for the next 12 months. Cinta has been raising a $40 million to $50 million round since August but has not received any commitments so far. 

Fogdog barks again, or one of its founders does anyway. Brett Allsop, who co-founded the online sports retailer in 1994 that merged with Global Sports in 1999, has joined Amadeus Capital Partners, a venture capital firm that invests in new technologies in the U.K. and continental Europe, as an associate. The firm also named another new associate, Shantanu Bhagwat, who previously worked at the management consultancy firm Monitor Company, advising businesses on their strategies and on restructuring plans. - By John Fuller <mailto:fuller@technologicp.com>

Saving Costs via Optics

With capital scarce and bandwidth aplenty, optical
components manufacturers face tough market conditions.
Now, systems companies are focusing on reducing costs
and helping carriers do more with the capacity they
already have. Happily, a number of optical technology
companies appear well positioned to capitalize on this
trend. At Optical Portfolio, you'll hear from startups
such as Symmorphix, Telephotonics and Proximion Fiber
Optics, which are using integration, tunability, and
real-time network monitoring to create more intelligent
and efficient optical networks.
