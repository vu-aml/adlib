Tips & Tricks 
Only so many hours in a day: The Date Book's  
Preferences command adjusts the number of visible hours  
in a day. You may prefer to view only the hours from  
10 a.m. to 5 p.m., for example. If you'd rather only  
see your appointments on the screen (with no blank  
time slots), specify the same hour as the start and 
end time for the day.
