An anonymous reader writes "A decision in Tokyo District Court could have
implications in Japan for online services that let users store files, if
any music files are involved. The court case pitted JASRAC, the Japanese
organization that collects fees for public music performances, against
Image City, whose MYUTA service lets users employ a central server to
store songs from their own CDs, to play on their own phones. The Tokyo
District Court handed down a [0]ruling declaring Image City guilty of
copyright infringement (Google translation). Despite the music being
stored strictly for personal use, the ruling reasoned that the act of
uploading music to a central server owned by a company is the equivalent
of distributing music to that company. This has implications for other
services such as Yahoo! Briefcase and Apple's .Mac, which could mean
these companies are guilty of copyright infringement if any of their
users in Japan store music in their accounts for personal use. Here are
some [1]additional details on JASRAC's activities and methods." Neither
article talks about possible appeals, or about how strong a precedent
this case sets in the Japanese legal system.

Several readers sent us links to an AP story about a pair of Kansas City
booksellers who [0]staged a book bonfire, claiming to protest declining
literacy. The story doesn't convey a sure sense of the booksellers'
motives for what could, in fact, be a PR stunt or a subtle act of
extortion against book lovers — it does mention that people were buying
books out of the piles awaiting immolation. The [1]bookstore's own site
tries to sound sincere, but it offers visitors a chance to save books
from the flames for $1 each plus postage.

June 4) at glovis.usgs.gov or earthexplorer.usgs.gov. This is to be a
pilot project for a larger effort called the Landsat Data Continuity

pcause writes "There has been a lot of talk recently about the [0]need
for programmers to shift paradigms and begin building more parallel
applications and systems. The need to do this and the hardware and
systems to support it have been around for a while, but we haven't seen a
lot of progress. The article says that gaming systems have made progress,
but MMOGs are typically years late and I'll bet part of the problem is
trying to be more parallel/distributed. Since this discussion has been
going on for over three decades with little progress in terms of
widespread change, one has to ask: is parallel programming just too
difficult for most programmers? Are the tools inadequate or perhaps is it
that it is very difficult to think about parallel systems? Maybe it is a
fundamental human limit. Will we really see progress in the next 10 years
that matches the progress of the silicon?"

An anonymous reader writes "For the last few years makers from Creative
to Virgin have proclaimed their latest digital audio player to be an iPod
Killer, only to watch those portables flame-out in the marketplace. This
doesn't mean there was anything wrong with them, in fact some were pretty
decent. They just couldn't compete under all the iPod hype. It turns out
that this pattern has created a [0]huge sub-market of new-in-the-box
stock, sold for pennies on the dollar to overstock vendors who then pawn
them off cheap to the public. For the price of a basic iPod Shuffle you
can now acquire some well-equipped units from a few years back. Examples
include the 40GB Toshiba Gigabeat F40 and AlienWare's CE-IV with external
speaker system."

[0]FishWithAHammer writes "As part of my [1]Google Summer of Code
project, I'm working with [2]WinLibre to develop a Debian-like software
download system for free/open source software on the Windows platform. My
reasoning is that open source software suffers from poor presentation.
Most computer laymen, even those aware of open source software, often
don't have any idea how to go about looking for it, but would use it if
it were easier to access. What [3]I have proposed is both a Debian-style
packaging mechanism (capable of using Windows Installer MSIs or not, as
the user wishes) and a software 'catalog' that takes the best aspects of
Synaptic and Linspire's Click-N-Run system. Seamless, simple installation
and removal of programs in as straightforward a way as apt-get (there
will be a command-line tool as well). I'm posting to Slashdot to get the
ideas of you lot who, while you may not be the target audience, can
certainly provide insights that can be of value." Read on for more of

unlametheweak writes "North Carolina is thinking of the children by
passing a law [0]requiring parents to verify they are parents before
[1]letting their children onto social networking sites. Notwithstanding
the whole concept of an Internet ID for people in general; children are
now being tracked by cellular phones with GPS, spied upon with Parent
Controls (MS Vista has built-in parental spyware), and also strategically
placed Nanny Cams, keyboard loggers, etc. 'Few of the proposals we've
seen so far seem like good ways to [protect children], but North
Carolina's approach at least has the virtue of novelty--unlike most video
game legislation, which relies on similar rhetoric but has been almost
universally struck down by the courts, sometimes at great cost to the
states.' Is the zoo-like Minority Report world in which children are
growing up in today doing more harm than good? How will this affect a 14
year old, much less a 17 year old "child"?"

DoubleClick. Between a few days and a week from now the FTC should either
declare the all clear, or elevate the process to a 'second request'
stage. That would indicate more serious issues the federal body has an
interest in. Google stated it was confident the purchase would hold up
under scrutiny. 'In the complaint, the groups noted that Google collects
the search histories of its users, while DoubleClick tracks what Web
sites people visit. The merger, according to their complaint, would give
one company access to more information about the Internet activities of

[0]gadgetopia writes "ITWire is reporting that the Taiwanese manufacturer
Quanta has seemingly [1]confirmed a second generation of the Apple iPhone.
Another report referenced by the article suggests the new model could
come with a different case design. 'Quanta and Apple already enjoy a
strong relationship, with Quanta building both MacBooks and iPods for
Apple to sell worldwide, although Foxconn (Hon Hai Precision Industry) is
reported to be building the first batch of iPhones due to arrive in the
US market by the end of June. Reports suggest Quanta has received an
order for 5 million iPhones which are to be shipped in September ...
Presumably this could entail a 3G or even 3.5G HSDPA iPhone for European
markets due to get the iPhone by the end of the year, or even the
addition of more memory - imagine a 16Gb or even 32Gb iPhone, unlikely
though those will be this year mainly due to the high cost of 16 or 32Gb
of flash memory.'"

elkcsr writes "The San Jose Mercury news reports on the phenomenal
[0]discovery of 28 new extra-solar planets out there in our galaxy. All
of them are outside of the band scientists consider necessary for
supporting life as we know it, but the solar systems analyzed should
still be quite familiar to those of us in this neck of the woods. System
layouts feature small rocky planets towards the star and gas giants
further out. The biggest difference seen is a preference for elliptical
orbits, instead of generally circular orbit we enjoy. ' For example, the
team also described new details about one specific exoplanet, discovered
two years ago. This planet, which circles the star Gliese 436, is thought
to be half rock, half water. Its rocky core is surrounded by an amount of
water compressed into a solid form at high pressures and low
temperatures. It makes a short, 2.6-day orbit around Gliese 436. Based on
its radius and density, scientists calculate that it has the mass of 22
Earths, making it slightly larger than Neptune. "The profound conclusion
is, here we've found yet another type of planet that is already
represented in our solar system," Marcy said.'"

[0]miller60 writes "The long-suffering customers of RegisterFly should
soon be able to manage their names again after ICANN arranged for the
[1]transfer of its 850,000 domains to GoDaddy.com. ICANN terminated
RegisterFly's accreditation back in March but it took a court order to
pry the domains loose so they could be transferred to another registrar.
For those just joining the story (see [2]earlier [3]discussions on
Slashdot), RegisterFly is the New Jersey domain registrar that collapsed
amid management chaos in February, leaving most customers unable to
manage, renew, or transfer their domains. ICANN, which was widely
criticized for its inability to do more for RegisterFly customers,
expressed relief at the saga's apparent conclusion."

[0]Dekortage writes "The Washington Post is reporting on recent
neuroscience research indicating that [1]the brain is pre-wired to enjoy
altruism — placing the interests of others ahead of one's own. In
studies, '[G]enerosity activated a primitive part of the brain that
usually lights up in response to food or sex... Altruism, the experiment
suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish
urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired and pleasurable.'
Such research 'has opened up a new window on what it means to be good,'
although many philosophers over recorded history have suggested similar
things."

An anonymous reader writes "An Israeli startup has squeezed a [0]complete
hardware firewall into a USB key. The 'Yoggie Pico' from [1]Yoggie
Systems runs Linux 2.6 along with 13 security applications on a 520MHz
PXA270, an Intel processor typically used in high-end smartphones. The
Pico works in conjunction with Windows XP or Vista drivers that hijack
traffic at network layers 2-3, below the TCP/IP stack, and route it to
USB, where the Yoggie analyzes and filters traffic at close-to-100Mbps
wireline speeds. The device will hit big-box retailers in the US this
month at a price of $180." Linux and Mac drivers are planned, according
to the article.

CVG is reporting on comments made by Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart. In an
interview with the site, he points out that traditional PC RPG developers
are in danger of [0]permanently losing out to the developers of Massively
Multiplayer Online Games. "He believes it's key that developers of
non-MMO RPGs look closely at what the genre offers over MMORPGs to ensure
the RPG genre doesn't lose out to the increasingly popular massively
multiplayer online world. 'I think those of us that make non-MMO RPGs
need to look at what a single-player/small multiplayer RPG can do that
MMOs can't and spend our time and effort on those things', Urquhart said.
