Jeff-

Stacy is out so I was wondering if you could look at this confirm and let me know if it is correct and ok to be sent out.  The language in the other section is what the trader wants added and she is wanting the confirm ASAP.  Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Patrice-

If you could also look and let me know what you think.

 
Thanks
