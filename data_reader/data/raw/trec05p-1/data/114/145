Tana,

Can I please get one more NDA related to the sale of DealBench prepared?  This one is for InfrastructureWorld, and the contact is Lenny Izzo who is a Vice President.  He asked that you fax the NDA to 650-624-7808.  Please email it to him as well.  I would like to get this one done today if at all possible.

Thanks so much,
Ross
