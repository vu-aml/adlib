   Liable to vanish or pass away like vapor; fleeting.

     The  Pen  which  gives. . .  permanence to the evanescent
     thought of a moment.
     --Horace Smith, Tin Trumpet

     Every  tornado  is  a  little  different,  and they are all
     capricious, evanescent and hard to get a fix on.
     --"Oklahoma  Tornado  Offers Hints of How a Killer Storm Is
     Born," [1]New York Times, May 11, 1999

     The  accidentally  famous. . . may write books, appear on
     talk  shows,  and, in so doing, attract even greater public
     attention.  This  type  of  celebrity status, of course, is
     brittle and evanescent.
     --Lawrence M. Friedman, The Horizontal Society
     _________________________________________________________

   Evanescent  is  from  Latin  evanescere, "to vanish," from e-,
