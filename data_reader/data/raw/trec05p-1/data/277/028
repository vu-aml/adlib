I think Chad imbibed a copious amount of "contaminated well water" last night...at least he sounds like it!!!

FYI...I spent the majority of my drive home on the phone with Chad, complaining that someone had stolen my tailgate!!! I couldn't see it in my rear view mirror....in actuality; it was just "down".

Sorry I was not there. Would have rather been there than at the El Campo 
Civic Center talking to upset people about their contaminated well water.
