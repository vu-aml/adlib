You asked, you received.  I've given a bunch of written material to Alan for his review as well.  He apparently has also been charged with developing a budget of sorts.  You may want to put the turd in his pocket as it seems he is a bit low on work.

Sorry.  Here are the budget documents from 2001, 2000, 1999.  Be thankful I didn't send you the budget from 1998.  I'd start with the most recent 2001 budgets, then work backwards.
