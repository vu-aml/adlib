Louise:

I just wanted to send you a quick note with the hope that you might have a chance to read your e-mail. It seemed more awkward to me to try and catch you in person giving the frenetic pace and fluidity of our situation.

Basically all I want to tell you is that I'm here to help in this process, and encourage you to let me know if there is anything else in particular I can help on. I have spoken and offered the same directly to Miller, Calger and Duran. I'm not telling folks this out of lack of current work flow. As I think you know, the development group is in the middle of several active transactions that we expect to close in the near term, and we remain keenly focused on making these deals happen (as evidenced by the $1.375 million Doyle insurance settlement finalized today). 

I'm approaching you and others specifically because I have 2 years of Chapter 11 bankruptcy experience. Prior to me joining Enron in May of 1998, I was with Kenetech Corporation (a 1,200 employee publicly traded IPP). In 1996 (after having worked as an Originator at Kenetech since 1990), Kenetech filed for Chapter 11. As part of the Chapter 11 process, I was one of 6 senior commercial employees retained by the Company to be responsible for liquidating the Company's assets. As such, I am very familiar with the Chapter 11 process, and how deals get done in this context. Enron is obviously of a far greater magnitude, but I believe the basic skills and experience are directly applicable.

Again, as we go through this process, I just wanted to make you aware of my experience in this area, and let you know that I stand ready, willing and eager to take on additional tasks.

With respect to our current deal flow, I also wanted to let you know we are working on the following which I will get to you by Friday (or earlier if need be):

1. Transaction list, status, and valuation;
2. Site bank summary and exit / monetization strategy;
3. Projected site bank maintenance budget.

I will, of course, also provide this information to Miller, Calger and Duran.

Best regards,

Ben
