Good day,=20

I know this will come to you out of the blue as a surprise. I write=20
this crucial mail to solicit your
assistance in a transaction that will be very beneficial to you, with=20=

hope that you will never let
me down either now or in future. Please study the following account=20
carefully and respond urgently.=20

I am  Mr Samuel  Nzuma  a Zimbabwean citizen, the eldest son of late=20=

Honourable Adam Nzuma. My father served the President Mugabe's=20
government=20
faithfully in various capacities as a minister and chairman of=20
agriculture trust fund. He was however arrested on 4th April 2002=20
because he was=20
against Mugabe's government concerning the ongoing land dispute that=20=

erupted in Zimbabwe some years back.=20

My father while in detention was humiliated and tortured by Mugabe's=20=

security operatives, in spite of his falling health and as a result he=20=

died in detention on the 28th day of April 2002.=20

Before his death, he confided to me and my brother the existence of=20
Eighteen million five hundred thousand United State dollar (18.5M US=20=

dollar) he secretly lodged in a vault. My brother and I are the only=20=

people=20
in my family who are privy to this information, the money is now in our=
=20
custody (cash).=20

Since his arrest, my family has been subjected to untold hardship and=20=

harassment. All my father's assets has been confiscated. His accounts=20=

frozen and we were been attacked and driven out of our family house in=20=

Harare.=20

Narrowly I escaped to Mali with my family and the boxes containing the=20=

money. On getting to Mali, we applied for political asylum. I could not=
=20
take such a huge foreign currency to a bank regular without raising an=20=

eyebrow. So I quickly deposited the boxes with a reputable security=20
company as artifacts. I have the depository agreement and the=20
certificate=20
of the deposit issued to me by the security company.=20

I was waiting to have a legal status in Mali before I could invest the=20=

money here. But last week I received a mail from Malian government=20
informing me that my family and I are not eligible to obtain political=20=

asylum, that my father was the one who had problem and not members of
his family and to that effect we should be ready to go back to Zimbabwe=
=20
soon.=20

At this point, I am frustrated and simply tired. My family lawyer=20
advised me to leave Africa. For this reason, I want you to assist me to=
=20
shift and invest this funds outside Africa. I will compensate you=20
generously to as much as 20% of the said amount at stake if only you=20=

can help me=20
I and my family will use the remaining 80% to start new life and seek a=
=20
new
happiness in overseas.

Please go to the following website to read about my side of the world.=20=

That will help you to understand what am talking about:=20
http://www.guardian.co.uk/zimbabwe/article/0,2763,1392593,00.html

Note that this transaction demands expediency, secrecy and absolute=20
trust. Our destiny is in your hands, do not abandon us. Please assist=20=

us=20
to escape this spectres of political persecution going on in Africa.=20=

More also treat this mail with utmost confidentiality because of my=20
safety=20
and the money.=20

I eagerly await your reply. Please include fax and phone number for=20
easy communication .

Thanks and God bless
