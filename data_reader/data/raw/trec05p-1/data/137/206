Gerald,

Looks good to me.  In the signature block, should it be Enron Compression Services Company as opposed to Enron Compression Company?  The information that I have on the ROW tracts is not specifically descriptive other than to describe them as tracts owned by 1) Herbert and Margaret Lane Property, 2) Alan and Elizabeth English Property and 3) Kay Arnold Fritz Property all in dispute along the Shaky Joe Swamp Transmission Line.  The attorney representing these people is Brigham Moore LLP and the representing attorney appears to be Andrew Prince Brigham.  Hopefully, this is good enough.  If you need to talk to me, call me at 701-683-4683 or leave me a voice mail at 3-7350.   When you have a draft of the Construction Cost Overage letter, please send it to me.  Thanks again for all your help and hard work.

Thanks,
Chris Hilgert

Chris,  Attached is the document to which Russell and I have agreed.  Next step is for us to get signed and fax to Russell.  Do you have the tract descriptions that Gulf forwarded?  Does Dave?
