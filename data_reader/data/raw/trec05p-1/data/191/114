Kevin & Lloyd,

As we re-asses the fundamental information needed by the traders, I think that it is important to actively recruit Martin Lin to the power fundamentals group. 

Martin Lin has developed and continuously improved the current short term and long-term Interconnect and Ercot models as well as played an important part in bringing fourth advancements with Powerworld. He is the only person that has extensive and significant working familiarity with the Ercot power system.   He is of significant importance if we continue to make any changes or improvements to the current Interconnect and Ercot models.  His knowledge extends beyond the process of the flow of electricity and the transmission of power to include the ability to program in C++ and VBA.  In regards to Powerworld, he has both academic and practical expertise as well as a technical understanding of the functionality of the program. He has been leading the advancements with Powerworld in order to tie in powerworld with the interconnect models as well as utilize powerworld to conduct contingencies analysis and automatic ATC calculations.   Another area of expertise is his knowledge of options.  He has worked on  options models for broadband  services. 

If you have any questiosns in regards to the impact of his continbutions, please feel free to contact myself or Steve Benchluch. 

Thank You

Rika Imai
