available next of kin to claim.

To this regards, I have been directed by the board of Trustees of the
bank to notify the diseased next of kin, which I have done and found 
out that he has no next of kin, which means that this funds will be lost

development, myself and some of my trusted colleagues in the bank now see=
k
your indulgence to have you stand as late Mr.David Hardy's next of kin so=

that the fund will be subsequently transferred and paid into your foreign=

account.

this funds will be carefully worked out and we are assuring you a 100%
risk free transaction. You will be allowed to retain 30% of the total 
amountafter the transaction. If this proposal is okay by you, and you wis=
h

me furnish you with relevant details to this transaction.
