Sara,  the money was swept from the below BofA account to Enron Corp.'s BofA account 3750494015.  From there it was sent to another Enron Corp account at Citibank 00076486.  Presumably, this is it's final resting place.

Sara, ENA had one trade which matched this amount.  ENA deal number 674047.  

The money came into our account at Bank of America, acct. number 3751443337 account name "Enron Corp--ENA Cash Services"

The money is swept at the end of every day to a Citibank account, which I believe is in the name of Enron corp.  I am verifying with treasury to be sure.  As for the whereabouts of that specific parcel of cash, there's just no telling.  It would have been merged with everything else that gets swept into the account.

Laurel:

Please call me in the morning.  I need to verify:

1.	Was this an ENA transaction?

2.	What is the actual account number?

3. 	What happened to the money when it hit the BofA account?  I think you said it was swept into a Citibank account.  Was this an ENA or ENE account?

4.  	Where is the money today?

Thanks.
