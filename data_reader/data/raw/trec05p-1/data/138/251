Jim Steffes forwarded to Janet late Monday the recommended organization and budget($ 6.4 million total for both companies). Jim should be the primary point of contact on both the budget and Gov't Affairs organization for ENA/EES( I'll address remainder of issues with Whalley, kean, and Fallon). As an aside, it's possible the $6.4 million could be reduced somewhat as we begin to mitigate legacy real estate issues and also  consider locating the Houston-based staff in the above-referenced organization in available space with the business unit(s). Thanks.
