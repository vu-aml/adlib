	FYI.  I talked with Don and sounds like this report will give us what we
	need to determine which charts are actually late.  This is good news
	and a big step in helping the field identify the problem areas.
	Thanks. Lynn

Effective January 31, GMS has the ability to scan charts independently of the PGAS system so they can generate reports that identify which charts are received after monthly closing deadlines.  The first report will be provided to us after close on February 3.
