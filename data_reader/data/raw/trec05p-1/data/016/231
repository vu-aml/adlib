Team, 
Attached is the final Keystone Term Sheet proposal to Northern Natural Gas.  NNG is still in the process of having the CA signed.  As soon as the CA is signed by NNG (Tuesday at the earliest), the attached Term Sheet will be delivered to NNG by Ned Higgins.

 << File: NNG Keystone Term Sheet (July 30) II.doc >> 

Thanks, Lisa Druzbik
