Kevin Presto has informed me that they will be trading on only a portion of the curves which are currently in the Curve Manager.  As a result, we would like to migrate ONLY the curves that they will be using for UBS trading so as not to take up any unneccessary space.  As a result, attached is a list of the EAST curves that we would like migrated to the new curve manager for UBS trading. 

John P. - Please provide the guys with a similar list for the West.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
Casey
