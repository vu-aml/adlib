Randy, I think this addresses some of the concerns you had yesterday with BTU.

The information for Ventura gets transferred from the NBPL SCADA/EFM system directly to PGAS through a file extract and transfer that I do every month.  Fred Puetz, Lynn Johnson and Mike Swerczek are the programmers on our side that developed this.  Jeff May is the programmer on NNG's side that receives the data.  We have had numerous problems over the past several months where PGAS does not reflect the same information we are sending.  But Mike Swerczek has confirmed for me that we are sending the correct information -- something seems to be happening in the upload to PGAS.  This whole process worked fine before PGAS -- we've been doing this for several years.

Steve, I wasn't sure who all I was suppose to copy on  this so if I missed someone please forward this on to them.

First I looked over every daily BTU average from the NBPL Ventura GC from Sept through to date and there are no two days in a row  where the BTU value were the same although there we several days where if you rounded the BTU to 1 decimal place they would be the same.   I also verified back to September the Ventura GC BTU with the NBPL Glen Ullin GC BTU and our monthly averages for these two GCs have tracked between with 0.1 and 0.4 BTU of each other.  So I am confidant with the NBPL BTU numbers.

Second after  I received the Daily Volume Statement I checked the BTU factors for the days in question against the Ventura BTU average for that day.  What I found was that when the statement would show a series of days that the BTU was the same the first day was correct but the rest of the days were not.   
Although when I took the volume in MCF  times the BTU factor listed in the report for the days in question I did not get the same value listed as the MMBTU value.
I then took the MCF times the SCADA BTU average and it then calculates correctly for the MMBTU listed.

I spoke with John Freeman and we verified the information in the NBPL SCADA and it is correct and matches up with the Daily Volume statement for MCF and MMBTU but the BTU factor did not match up  for the days in question.   So I believe the volumes and energy values to be correct it is just the BTU factor listed on the Daily report that is incorrect on some days.

I have listed below some of information out of our SCADA system for a few of the days in question.  Do you know how the volume and BTU values get from NBPL to NNG for this statement?  The problem may be in the transfer of that data.
