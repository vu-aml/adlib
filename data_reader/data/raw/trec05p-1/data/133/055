Investment ideas

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Beware the ghosts of Christmas 2001
Spirits are hanging over the markets, not all of 
which promise happy returns.

By Rick Wayman, CFA

The market will face some difficult challenges during the next two 
quarters, and investors need to be aware of these issues in order to 
invest wisely. So, in the spirit of the coming season, and with 
apologies to Charles Dickens, I would like to introduce you to 
these challenges as the ghosts of Christmas--Version 2001. 

Our main theme is that the economy is not as good as the market 
currently thinks it is, and that earnings will come under increased 
pressure by issues that have not yet appeared on the Streets radar. 
The combination of these forces could depress stocks near-term, 
but could also result in a classic January rally.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Value without tears
Those who follow our value-oriented screens know that 
value investors don't just wind up buying dogs. 

By Marc Gerstein

All investors risk getting involved with dogs every day. But value 
investors need to be especially sensitive to the matter, since they 
make a regular practice of searching for stocks that look attractive 
based on some simple arithmetic that any investor can do, and on 
answers that anyone can see. If you're searching for value, you 
almost have to presume that anything you uncover is a dog until 
you receive specific evidence showing otherwise.

a home  problems resulting from defects in the title.
