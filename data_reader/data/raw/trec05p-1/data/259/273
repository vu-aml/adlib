   Word of the Day for Sunday March 31, 2002:

   gravitas \GRAV-uh-tahs\, noun:
   High seriousness (as in a person's bearing or in the treatment
   of a subject).

     At  first sight the tall, stooped figure with the hawk-like
     features   and   bloodless  cheeks,  the  look  of  extreme
     gravitas,  seems  forbidding  and  austere, the abbot of an
     ascetic   order,  scion  of  an  imperial  family  who  has
     foresworn the world.
     --John  Lehmann,  "T.S.  Eliot  Talks About Himself and the
     Drive to Create," [1]New York Times, November 9, 1953

     And  we want to tell our readers about sharp, clever books,
     utterly lacking in gravitas, that we know will delight them
     on the beach or the bus.
     --Benjamin  Schwarz,  "(Some  of)  the best books of 2001,"
     [2]The Atlantic, December 2001
     _________________________________________________________

   Gravitas is from the Latin gravitas, "heaviness, seriousness,"
   from gravis, "heavy, serious."
