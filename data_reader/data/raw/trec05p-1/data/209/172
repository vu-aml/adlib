FOR ALL OF US: STAYING YOUNG


1. Throw out nonessential numbers. This includes age, weight, and height.
Let the doctor worry about them. That is why you pay him/her.


2. Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull you down.


3. Keep learning. Learn more about the computer, crafts, gardening,
whatever. Never let the brain idle. "An idle mind is the devil's
workshop." The devil's name is Alzheimer's.


4. Enjoy the simple things. When the children are young, that's all you
can afford. When they're in college, that's all you can afford. After you
retire, that's all you can afford!


5. Laugh often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath. Laugh so
much that you can be tracked in the store by your distinctive laughter.


6. The tears happen. Endure, grieve, and move on. The only person who is
with us our entire life, is ourselves. Be alive while you are alive,
don't put out a mailbox on the highway of death and just wait in
residence for your mail.


7. Surround yourself with what you love, whether it is family, pets,
keepsakes, music, plants, hobbies, whatever. Your home is your refuge.


8. Cherish your health. If it's good, preserve it. If it's unstable,
improve it. If it's beyond what you can improve, get help.


9. Don't take guilt trips. Go to the mall, the next county, a foreign
country, but not to guilt country.


10. Tell the people you love that you love them, at every opportunity.


AND ALWAYS REMEMBER Life is not measured by the number of breaths we
take, but by the moments that take our breath away.
