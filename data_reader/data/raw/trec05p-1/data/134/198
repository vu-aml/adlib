SOUTH AFRICA
URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL
Dear,
I know you will be surprise to read from me, but please consider this letter as
request from a family in dare need for your assistance. Firstly I must
introduce myself. I am MR.PATRICK MANKOU from ZIMBABWE, I am the first and only
son of MR. KINGSLEY MANKOU.I am presently residing in South Africa. I got your
contact from the South African Information Exchange (S.A.I.E.) in Johannesburg
and On behalf of my mother who is a widow MRS. ANGELA MANKOU. I decided to
solicit for your assistance to transfer the sum of US$12.M (Twelve  Million
United States Dollars) in your personal or company’s account. Before my fathers
death he was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers and he was poisoned by
the agent of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged
support and sympathy for the Zimbabwe opposition party controlled by the white
minority. Before his death, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit this
money to a Security and Finance Company. This money was deposited in a box as
gemstone to avoid much demurrage from the Security CompanyThis money was
earmarked for purchase of new machinery and chemicals for the farms and to
establish new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.  In his will he specially drew my
attention to this sum of US$12.M (Twelve United States Dollars) that he
deposited in a safe box in a private Security and Finance Company here in
Johannesburg, South Africa.  IN FACT MY FATHER SAID IN HIS WILL AND QUOTE: “My
beloved son, I wish to draw your attention to this money which I deposited in
your name in a box with a Security and Finance Company in Johannesburg, South
Africa. In case of my absence on earth caused by death. You should solicit for
a reliable foreign partner to assist you to transfer this money out of South
Africa for investment purpose.From the above, you will understand that the
lives and future of my family depends on this money as much. I will be grateful
if you can assist us. We are now living in South Africa as Asylum seekers and
financial laws of South Africa does not allow Asylum seekers (refugee) certain
right to such huge amount of money. In view of this, I cannot invest this money
in South Africa,hence I am asking you to assist me to transfer this money out of
South Africa for investment purpose. For your efforts,I am prepared to offer you
25% of the total fund. While 5% will be set aside for local and international
expenses and 70% will be kept by my family and me. Finally modalities on how
the transfer will be done and conveyed to you once we establish trust and
confidence between ourselves. Looking forward to your reply and please treat as
veryUrgent.
Thanks,
Best regards
(MR:PATRICK MANKOU FOR  THE FAMILY
