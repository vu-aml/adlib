Hi Vince,

Happy New Year.

how are you? how was your Christmas?
how is everything going in Houston?

I am OK.
we went to Scotland over the Christmas.
I joined RWE trading at the beginning of January.
I am quite happy with my choise and I would like to establish myself here.

most people from Research in London either found jobs already or prepared to
wait until god opportunities come.

how are our guys in Houston doing?
what is going on with Vasant , Krishna and other guys?

many thanks,


Slava Danilov
