Complements of the day,

Before I proceed I must first apologize for this unsolicited mail to you.I am =
truly aware that this is certainly not a conventional way of approach to =
establish a relationship of trust and future partnership but you will realize =
the need for my sudden action. 

My Name is Martin Hill,a Senior Security Officer at the Department of =
Consignment lodge and Memorandum of agreement with king Security Pty Ltd =
South Africa.With respect to the fact that we do not know eachother =
before.Actually,I got your contact informations via the web while searching =
for a relative.

FULL UNDERSTANDING: 

There is a consignment that was deposited with our vault department on the =
08/10/2004 for  safe keeping purpose for a period of time.After securing all =
the necessary certificates,the consignment was immediately deposited as =
requested by the depositor.Now the safe keeping date has expired,several =
notification letter was sent to the mailing address of the depositor but we =
received no reply. 

In view of this development I now decided to go through our vetting computer =
and some old files in our book of records to find out if the depositor has =
changed his mailing address and why the consignment has not been claimed.The =
owner of this consignment was MR.ALLISON MARK HEACOX,a foreign gold miner =
with TAUTONA GOLD MINE COMPANY"KRUGER LAND" here in South Africa,who until =
his death in an underground explosion in a mine that occured a week ago was a =
Geologist and gold miner by profession.

This consignment was deposited with seria number,AMH/075/9166/KSCL/2004, =
tagged "Personal Documents". He requested that the real content of the =
consignment which is gold worth about ($8.5M) should never be declared in the =
deposit slip which his company has no knowledge about this consignment.The =
DEPOSIT DEED CONFIRMATION CERTIFICATE,GUARRANTEED DEPOSIT CERTIFICATE,in =
accordance with the Depositary Law of 1988,Paragraph 12"A" Section =
9A-SUB-Section QA4,states that a depositor can choose if "Company or Private" =
entity be indicated in the agreement in case of an event.

CONCLUSION:

I would want you to stand as the next of kin since you both share the same =
family name as the late depositor,based on my position at this department,I =
will now present new documents to you showing your name Mr.Mark Heacox,as the =
new proxy and next of kin to the consignment which will be released on your =
arrival to company here in south africa or shipped to you the same day you =
present all the necessary documents needed for the claim back to my =
department,which I will be forwarding to you once we come to an agreement.

You will take 70% from the total amount,while the balance 30% will be for =
me,if you find this gesture favourable,kindly indicate by a return mail,You =
can reach me on my private email address: martinhill@usa.com. 

I look forward to hearing from you soonest.

Warmest Regards,

MARTIN HILL
