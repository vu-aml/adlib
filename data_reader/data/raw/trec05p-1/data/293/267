Jennifer,
Yes, I do believe you have the correct understanding.  The ttls you have tie to the dms impact. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Elsie

Elsie:

Sorry, in looking over this again with Lisa, we want to be sure that we understand the request correctly.  

See attached for my understanding of what you are requesting and please confirm.

I looked at this from the perspective of each entire deal.  For each, I took the total price and volume of the deal and subtracted/added the MWs you specified and then calculated the revised value of each deal.  

Is this a correct understanding of the changes needed and their impact?

Thanks, Jenny

Jennifer,,,,,I updated the dms....in the comment section this is for 2 deals...the difference between enpwer mw and revised mw will be 8150 mw (12600mw revised to 4450mw)...the spreadsheet is the detail for the changes needed and not totals for the deals.  

Thanks,
Elsie

Elsie:

Thanks for the welcome!

Already I have a quick question - in the attached spreadsheet, the disputed MW columns seem to add up to 12600 and 4450.  In reading the DMS, I would expect them to add up to 14600 and 5600 (or 12600 and 3600, if I only include the referrenced deal, #12593). Am I missing something?

Jenny
