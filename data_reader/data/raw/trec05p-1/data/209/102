Louise,

Kevin Presto has some concerns about doing transactions with brokers and is thinking maybe on the power side that we will not do any broker transactions either over the telephone or online and he would like to talk about his ideas with you and the gas guys as well.

I won't start marketing to brokers until I hear from you or we meet on the subject.

Do you want me to organise a meeting?

Dave
