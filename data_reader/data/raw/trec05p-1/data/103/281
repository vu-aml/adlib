14th Court Extends Deadly Weapon Finding
Texas Lawyer
Houston's 14th Court of Appeals may have handed prosecutors another
plea bargaining tool on Oct. 11 when it upheld a jury's finding
that a man found guilty of failing to stop and render aid used a
"deadly weapon" in the commission of the offense. In a 2-1
decision, the court held in Cates v. Texas that a rational jury
could conclude from the evidence that Johnny Weldon Cates II
operated his pickup truck in a manner capable of causing death or
serious injury when he left the scene of a fatal accident that he
caused.

The now-repealed provision of 42 U.S.C. §1437f(e) requiring that

sanitary" neither displays Congressional intent to create a private
right of action nor creates a federal right that is judicially
enforceable through 42 U.S.C. §1983. 5th Cir. No. 00-11160; Posted

In a case alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, the court's

necessarily indicate ineffective assistance. Texarkana Court of
