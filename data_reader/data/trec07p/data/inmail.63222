I got a long ways with this.

Given a base64 encoded string I can decode it using MIME::Base64.  But it
returns octets (thought they all look the same).
Convert the octets to string using encode_utf() from Encode and you can
use regex on it just fine.

But I was surprised to find that my first test case what a japanese
string of some 8-10 characters with no whitespace.  I suppose it could
be a single word, but I didn't think the CJK languages had more than
2-4 characters (pictographs?) to a word.  But I have no real experiences.
