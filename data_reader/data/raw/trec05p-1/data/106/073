 	  	 Dear Mike,

On Monday, the Washington bureau will follow up on the President's new push for energy legislation in Congress. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says on Friday, we heard some of the President's strongest language to date, urging Democrats in the Senate to bring a bill to the floor. 

There are also several energy hearings scheduled in Congress next week, including one on possible new limits on power plant emissions in the Senate and another on MTBE in the House. The hearings are some of the first to be rescheduled since the anthrax scare hit Congress earlier this month. 

RDI Consulting Principal Mark Morey is penciled in from the Washington bureau on Monday. He'll share his insight on where the emissions issue stands on the Hill during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast. 

Secretary of Interior Gale Norton was in Houston Friday at the IPAA conference. On Monday Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us more from Secretary Norton on Lease Sale 181 and how drilling in ANWR will create thousands of jobs for Texans. 

Noble Drilling CEO Jim Day will also stop by the Houston bureau to talk about his company's third-quarter earnings. The company reported very good earnings but Day warns that the fourth quarter may not be as good because of a weakening economy. Join us for all the details on Monday. 

ENL's Kym McNicholas will speak with Western States Petroleum Association Spokesperson Dave Fogarty next week. Fogarty will discuss California's decision to ban MTBE by December 31, 2002 and whether the state is ready for this move. Catch Fogarty from the West Coast bureau on Wednesday. 

Former Governor Pete Wilson tells Kym he takes responsibility for signing the state's deregulation plan, but adds there were steps Governor Gray Davis could and should have taken to avoid what turned out to be an energy crisis. Kym will have all the details on this story next week. 

Finally from New York, Goldman Sachs Analyst Dave Fleischer will drop by to talk about the gas market during the noon ET newscast. 

Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. Have a fantastic weekend! 

Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.
