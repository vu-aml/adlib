Player Updates NFL Reports 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/10/01
Smith missed practice Friday and will be a gametime decision for Sunday's game. He is unlikely to play, and we don't recommend you use him this week. However, keep an eye on his status, as Troy Hambrick wouldn't be a great starter this week if Smith plays and takes away some of his carries.

Quincy Carter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=235201&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/10/01
Carter is expected to suit up as the emergency quarterback for Sunday's game, a! cc! ording to The Dallas Morning News. It's highly unlikely that he will play, but we wouldn't recommend you use him as a Fantasy starter even if he was expected to start anyway.

Bill Schroeder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 11/10/01
Schroeder will play Sunday after missing four weeks with an injured ankle. He is expected to start and is worth getting back into your active lineup against a subpar Bears' secondary.

Doug Chapman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=187510&>, RB MIN - Matty Updated 11/10/01
Chapman practiced with the Vikings' first team on Friday and is likely to start Sunday, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. He will share time with Michael Bennett if Bennett is able to play. We don't recommend you use Chapman this week considering he faces a tough Eagles defense and will share carries.

Michael Bennett <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/10/01
The Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports that Bennett practiced with the second team on Friday, and the Vikings hope he can rotate with Doug Chapman on Sunday. It doesn't sound as if either player will get a large number of carries, so don't expect Bennett to provide your team with solid stats, particularly against the Eagles' defense.

Chris Weinke <http://football222.! fa! ntasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/10/01
Weinke missed his third straight practice Friday with a sore throwing shoulder and is unlikely to play Sunday against St. Louis. The Panthers will make a gametime decision as to their starting quarterback, but Matt Lytle is the likely starter with recently-signed Jim Harbaugh serving as the backup. We wouldn't recommend you use any Carolina QB this week, and you should also expect the Panthers' receivers to post subpar stats.

Duce Staley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 11/09/01
Staley could start on Sunday against Minnesota. According to published reports, rookie tailback Correll Buckhalter (shoulder) is still a little banged up, and Staley is the healthier back at this time. 

Edgerrin James <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=133320&>, RB IND - JWillie Updated 11/09/01
James has been downgraded to doubtful for Sunday's game against Miami and Colts Head Coach Jim Mora says he will not play. Don't use James this week, and instead consider using Dominic Rhodes, who will start in his place.

Reuben Droughns <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=187528&>, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/09/01
Droughn! s ! started last week's game against San Francisco, but he wasn't very productive. He split carries with Lamont Warren in the game, and had ten carries for 36 yards. The same situation will likely hold true this weekend against Tampa Bay, so be sure to avoid any Detroit backs outside of deeper leagues. 

Johnnie Morton <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1223&>, WR DET - Hunter Updated 11/09/01
Morton had a down game against San Francisco last week, and could be in for another tough outing against Tampa Bay. The Bucs have the fourth-ranked defense in the league against the pass, so don't expect big numbers out of Morton this week. 

Lamont Warren <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1112&> , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/09/01
Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Tampa Bay. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues. 

Ahman Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 11/09/01
Green had a huge game against Tampa Bay last week, but don't expect the same type of output against Chicago. His numbers may in fact be down, but Green is too good to bench unless you have a a number of solid tailbacks on your roster. 

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1028&>, Q! B ! GB - Frank Updated 11/09/01
Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face a Chicago team on Sunday that is a bit vulnerable to the pass, so be sure to start Favre this week. 

Bubba Franks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/09/01
Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in seven games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis. 

Mike Alstott <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1169&>, RB TB - JWillie Updated 11/09/01
Alstott has scored four touchdowns in his last two games, and his success should continue this week against Detroit. Alstott's yardage numbers may not be very good, but he's definitely a good start in points-only leagues. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 11/09/01
Dunn has struggled in recent weeks, but he should have a good outing against Detroit this week. The Lions are ranked 30th in the league against the run, so look for Dunn to come up big for the Buccaneers. 

Brad Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1039&>, QB TB - Matty Updated 11/09/01! 
Johnson has been putting up decent numbers in recent weeks, and should continue that trend against Detroit. The Lions secondary is vulnerable to the pass, so look for Johnson to have a solid game. 

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 11/09/01
Johnson could be in for a big week against Detroit. The Lions secondary is ranked 25th in the league against the pass, so look for Johnson to shine. He's a must-start in any Fantasy league. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 11/09/01
Culpepper is coming off a bye and should be geared up to play against the Philadelphia Eagles and Donovan McNabb. Culpepper's numbers may not be great against a tough Eagles defense, but he's still far too valuable to ever bench. 

Cris Carter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 11/09/01
Carter has had some below-average yardage games this season, but he's still one of the best players in the league when it comes to finding the end zone. For that reason, it's tough to ever put him on your reserve list, even against a tough Philadelphia secondary. 

Byron Chamberlain <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1496&>, TE MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/09/0! 1
Chamberlain has had a few bad outings in recent weeks, and may struggle against Philadelphia's tough linebackers. He has been a solid tight end overall, however, so starting him is still a good move unless you have a better option. 

Randy Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/09/01
Moss is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Philadelphia due to an ankle injury. The Eagles have a solid secondary, but Moss is still worth starting because of his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers. 

Ricky Williams <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=133448&>, RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11! /0! 9/01
Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face a Niners defense that has been pretty solid against the run, but Williams is still a must-start. 

Joe Horn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 11/09/01
Horn has had four straight solid performances, and is likely to have another against San Francisco. He torched the Niners for 15 catches, 285 yards and a score last season, and is a must-start for Fantasy owners this week.

Willie Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1234&>, WR NO - Martin Updated 11/09/01
Jackson's numbers aren't mind-blowing, but he has been a decent option for Fantasy owners in deeper leagues this season. Unless you have better options on your roster, Jackson is worth starting this week against San Francisco. 

Torry Holt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=133310&>, WR STL - Tori Updated 11/09/01
Holt has been a solid wideout this season, and should continue his success against Carolina on Sunday. Be sure to start him this week. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 11/09/01
Bruce had a huge game before St. Louis' bye week, and he'll likely have another big performance in Week Nine. Look for Bruce to put up 100 yards receiving and a score against the questionable Carolina secondary. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 11/09/01
Faulk (knee) has been practicing all week, and he will start on Sunday against Carolina. He's a must-start against any team, so be sure to put him into your lineup. 

Ernie Conwell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1366&>, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/09/01
Conwell has become a decent option at a position lacking relia! bl! e players. Unless you have a better option, Conwell is a good start against Carolina. 

Kurt Warner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 11/09/01
Warner could have a huge game this weekend at the Trans World Dome. He'll be facing a Carolina defense ranked 29th in the league against the pass, so 300-plus yards passing and three touchdowns is a definite possibility.
