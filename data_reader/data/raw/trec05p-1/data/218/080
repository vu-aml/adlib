RISK, WHERE YOU READ IT FIRST:

XCEL SEEKS $20B UTILITY MERGER; LOOKS TO BUY BACK NRG 

Xcel Energy, one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S., is courting
FirstEnergy, TXU and Entergy as potential merger partners and at the same
time is looking to repurchase the remaining 20% stake of its unregulated IPP
affiliate, NRG Energy, which it partially spun off in May 2000. 

U.K. UTILITY PUTS WIND BIZ ON THE BLOCK

U.K. utility Innogy has put its U.S. wind farm business up for sale and
hired J.P. Morgan to find a buyer. The portfolio, which consists of two 20
MW farms in California and a further 600 MW of projects in construction or
under development in California, Texas and Pennsylvania, could fetch Innogy
some $300 million.
