Team:

Following is a list of CA contracts that Jeremy and team are working on.

We need to assure ourselves that we are doing everything necessary to maintain the value in these deals and books of business until a sale is consummated or another decision is made.  This includes:

meter installations (Utility Transfer Dates - make sure to check CPUC and other requirements on time delta between when we signed the contract and the meter installation dates)
meter reading
billing
collections
etc.

Tranche 2 does include some deals from the PG&E book that we acquired.  This will / does have some impact on the Lodestar discussions that we had this morning.

As we discussed yesterday afternoon and this morning, let's lock this down this afternoon and make sure that critical operations & vendors are addressed in a timeframe that is appropriate to preserve and enhance the value in the CA portfolio.

Esmerelda - please set up a meeting at 2PM or 3PM today with the "to's" in this memo and any "cc" that would like to attend.

Thanks - Dan
