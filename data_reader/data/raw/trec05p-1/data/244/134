Subject:	Question and Update

1.	Steve Hotte would like to know if any other groups are capturing their time in SAP spent on the Dynegy Transition.  He has his group charging to an E work order which settles to NNG.  He asked me if I was charging to NNG all the time I am having to spend and I am not.  If he has the only group doing so than he plans on stopping the practice.  Please advise.

2.	Update on the NNG Measurement procedures/expectations:
·	I met with both Shelley and Don
·	The info Don gave me was the final conclusion of the Continuous Improvement project which recommended that all of Measurement be brought into one organization.  Of interest is that in the recommendation, it is stated that "The evaluation concluded that any partial implementation, i.e: moving any single group such as GMS into new reporting relationship in not recommended."
·	Current thinking of what will be presented:
a.	Time lines for, Field Chart changing and mailings, GMS chart processing, Fixed deadlines for Measurement close, Commodity invoices, PPA processing, GISB/Tariff requirements.
b.	Written bullet point procedures indicating each department roles and responsibilities related to billing Measurement data.  Departments covered, GMS, Field, Measurement Desk, IT, Gas Accounting
c.	Steve Klimesh is gathering from the different NNG field regions the following:
What are the field teams instructions, AND WHO PROVIDES THE INSTRUCTIONS, relative to the timing (when should they be sent/submitted) for submitting the following documents to GMS (Houston) throughout the month?
I only need to know for Northern Natural Gas activities.
Test Reports:
Change reports:
Spot Sample quality data:
Continuous proportionate to flow sample data:
Chromatograph Data:
Unmetered gas reports:
Other measurement related data/documents:

Shelley noted that in the current UAF detail field procedures there is no focus on the business deadlines so the reason for a separate set of procedures outlining roles and responsibilities.  It is intended that this would be concise enough that it could be printed on a card and handed out to all involved.

Shelley will also pull together the GISB and NNG Tariff language referencing measurement deadlines and approved estimating procedures.

Let me know if you have any questions or if we are heading in the wrong direction of what you expected.
