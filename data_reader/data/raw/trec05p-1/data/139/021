NINTH CIRCUIT USES EIGHTH AMENDMENT PROPORTIONALITY TEST TO
VOID NONCAPITAL SENTENCE IMPOSED UNDER CALIFORNIA'S THREE
STRIKES LAW

Prison terms, imposed under California's "Three Strikes"
law, that will ensure at least 50 years of incarceration for
a nonviolent recidivist convicted of petty theft violate the
Eighth Amendment, the Ninth Circuit declares. The court
finds the sentence grossly disproportionate to the gravity
of the defendant's property crimes and to comparable
sentences in other jurisdictions.

The Three Strikes law imposes a minimum 25-year sentence
without parole for any third felony offense by a defendant
with at least two prior convictions for "serious" or
"violent" felonies. The court cites several problems with
the statute, including that the triggering felony need not
be serious or violent, the prior strikes need not be violent
offenses, and there is no time period after which prior
convictions will no longer be counted as strikes. . . . Page

FRAUD ON COURT, AS OPPOSED TO FRAUD ON PTO, MAY NOT SERVE AS
GROUND FOR HOLDING PATENT UNENFORCEABLE, FEDERAL CIRCUIT
SAYS

Litigation misconduct by a patentee may be the basis for
dismissing a particular patent infringement suit but not for
finding the patent unenforceable, the Federal Circuit holds.
"Litigation misconduct, while serving as a basis to dismiss
the wrongful litigant, does not infect, or even affect, the
original grant of the property right," the court reasons.

The court distinguishes fraud on the court from inequitable
conduct before the Patent and Trademark Office in obtaining
the patent, which taints the patent itself and renders it
unenforceable by any party. The court disavows broad dicta
in a 1990 decision indicating that patents may be held
"unenforceable due to unclean hands." . . . Page 1298

PUNITIVE DAMAGES MEGA-AWARD IN EXXON VALDEZ CASE REVERSED BY
NINTH CIRCUIT AS UNCONSTITUTIONALLY EXCESSIVE

The $5 billion punitive damages award to commercial
fishermen injured by the "Exxon Valdez" oil spill is
unconstitutionally excessive, the Ninth Circuit rules. The
award is disproportionate to the $287 million compensatory
damages incurred by the plaintiffs, to potential criminal
and civil penalties, and to the $125 million restitution and
penalty settlement with federal and state authorities, the
court finds.

The unprecedented 1995 award was entered before the U.S.
Supreme Court spelled out the due process constraints on the
magnitude of punitive damages in "BMW v. Gore". Applying the
"Gore" standards, the Ninth Circuit concludes that the
district court did not properly take into account the purely
economic nature of the harm incurred by the plaintiffs, the
unintentional character of the accident, or the mitigating
actions undertaken by Exxon. . . . Page 1301

A complete topical index of Case Alert.

holds. . . . Page 1291

BANKING: A National Credit Union Administration rule
allowing family members of a group member to join multiple

statutory 3,000-member limit for such credit unions is
consistent with the recent changes to the Federal Credit
Union Act, the D.C. Circuit holds. . . . Page 1292

CRIMINAL LAW: The imposition of two consecutive

theft violates the Eighth Amendment's protection against
disproportionate sentences, the Ninth Circuit determines. .

ENVIRONMENT: CERCLA generally does not preempt a local
ordinance authorizing a California city to investigate and

FAMILY LAW: A parent's use of deception to establish "home

"reprehensible conduct" for which the court may decline
jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction
Act, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals holds in a case
of first impression. . . . Page 1296

PUBLIC CONTRACTS: An executive order restricting project
labor agreements on federal or federally assisted

statutory authority and is preempted by the National Labor
Relations Act, a federal court in the District of Columbia
holds, permanently enjoining enforcement of the order. . . .

percent. . . . Page 1300
