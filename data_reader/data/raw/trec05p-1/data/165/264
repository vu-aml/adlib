Kevin,  these cover some of the items we talked about yesterday that Dave has expanded on-  Another potential item, although not sure of  is MOPS sale closure and Eagle lateral sale closure.  
For TW we need to add the same elements related to new construction, Red Rock, Sun Devil, Trans Pecos.
Also overall impact of prepays-  MK
