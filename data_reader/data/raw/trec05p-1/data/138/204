EUR SWAPS
Pretty subdued mkt yest after last week's volatile session. Better receiving
in 5yr sector took swap spreads narrower by 1.5bps & brought 10yr and 30yrs
in heading for 1bps too. With the 5yr sector underperforming again on the
curve yest in both swaps and cash, 2-5's steepened 1.5bps, 5-10's flattened
1bps & the 2-5-10's fly retracted up to 8bps again. The only major swap flow
was 400mln 7yrs on an o'right basis, Japanese payer and looked to be related
to an option structure. Cedulas Cajas 2.5bn 7yr due to be priced today, do
expect to be swapped, although how much will be bought on asset swap so
offsetting that flow. This morning, broadly quiet, 2yr and 5yr outperforming
led by futures, swap spreads uo to 0.75bps wider in both & 10yr unch so far.

Over the past week, government issuance has totalled about Eur14.8bn; it has
been concentrated in the five-year sector (about Eur11bn), with the
reopening of the Bobl138 and a large five-year reopening in Italy. This
week, supply will be lighter, with only the launch of the new five-year BTAN
3.75% Jan 2007 in France (Eur3.5bn expected). On top of this, France will
proceed to another round of buy-backs: in the reverse auction, the OATs 4%
April 2009, 4% of October 2009, and 5.5% April 2010 will be bought back for
a maximum total amount of Eur2bn. The following week, auctions are scheduled
in Greece and Italy (Eur4.5bn expected).
