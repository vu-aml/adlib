Crude Oil Futures Slip After 6-Day Rally

    Crude oil futures for March delivery on the NYMEX slipped $0.47 
to $19.58 per barrel, ending a 6-day rally amid forecasts of another 
weekly build in crude oil inventories. Many expected the API to 
report that crude oil stocks increased by 1.3 million barrels for the 
week ended January 25th. In general, the expectations for inventory 
builds across the petroleum board were strong. Earlier in the week, 
some support for the market was found in a report by Petrologistics 
that the 10 OPEC countries with quotas trimmed output by 1.4 million 
bpd, not far from the cartel's pledge to lower production by 1.5 
million bpd. But prices were pressured downward yesterday after a 
survey by Dow Jones that contends the cartels production in January, 
excluding Iraq, will be 22.78 million barrels, more than 1 million 
barrels above its new quota of 21.7 million barrels. February heating 
oil and gasoline futures on the NYMEX, which are expire on Thursday, 
came under increased selling pressure. Heating oil for February 
delivery on the NYMEX dropped $0.0108 to $0.5205 per gallon. February 
gasoline futures on the NYMEX fell $0.0142 to $0.5669 per gallon. In 
London, Brent crude oil futures for March delivery on the IPE were 
down $0.41 to $19.24 per barrel

Refinery Earnings Tumble


    Economic recession, high product inventories and mild weather 
have cut 4th quarter profits at oil refineries, despite lower crude 
oil prices. Valero Energy says January's profit margins were even 
weaker than those posted in the 4th quarter, when margins declined 
40% from last year. Valero reported net income fell 45% to $51.6 
million, or $0.82 per share, compared with $93.3 million, or $1.47 
per share. in the prior year's 4th quarter. Marathon Oil also says 
profits from its 62% stake in MAP, a joint downstream venture with 
Ashland, fell on lower refining and wholesale marketing gross profit 
margins. Last Friday, Ashland reported earnings from refining and 
marketing fell about 32% on lower profit margins. Marathon says 4th 
quarter refining, marketing and transportation income was $221 
million, compared with the $305 million a year ago. Including all 
operations, Marathon posted a loss before special items of $898 
million, or $2.90 per share, compared with a loss of $310 million, or 
$1 per share, in the year-ago period. After adjustments for special 
items, Marathon's net income was $98 million, or $0.32 per share, 
compared with $386 million, or $1.25 per share, a year ago.

Petro-Canada Buys Veba Assets from BP


    Petro-Canada is buying the exploration and production assets of 
Germany's Veba Oil & Gas from BP in a C$3.2 billion deal that will be 
funded by debt. The cash deal brings Petro-Canada assets in the North 
Sea, North Africa and South America. It opens the door to a host of 
new international prospects in concentrated areas. The transaction is 
expected to increase Petro-Canada's earnings and cash flow per share 
immediately, allowing it to fund growth and pay down the debt it is 
taking on. It is Canada's 4th largest oil producer, refiner and 
gasoline marketer by stock market value. Last year it bought Lundin 
Oil's Libyan assets to complement its Algerian holdings. It is best 
known for natural gas and oil sands assets in Western Canada, stakes 
in offshore projects on the East Coast and a national chain of 
gasoline stations. Petro-Canada beat out Australia's Woodside 
Petroleum for the assets. Veba produces 175,000 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day and has proved reserves of 600 million barrels. 
The addition will increase Petro-Canada's reserves by 71% to 1.4 
billion barrels of oil equivalent, and output 78% to 400,000 barrels 
of oil equivalent per day. In North Africa, Veba has production in 
Libya and Syria and a small position in Egypt.

ChevronTexaco Posts 4th Quarter Loss 


    ChevronTexaco has posted a 4th quarter loss, mainly due to write-
offs of $1.85 billion in assets because of lower oil and natural gas 
prices and $1.17 billion for merger costs. ChevronTexaco had a loss 
of $2.52 billion, or $2.36 per share, compared to net income of $2.04 
billion, or $1.92, a year ago, based on the combined pre-merger 
reports of Chevron and Texaco. Revenue fell by 33% to $21.5 billion 
from $32.3 billion. Earnings from oil and natural gas production 
tumbled 73% to $544 million from $2.05 billion. Refining profit 
margins dropped 45%. Merger expenses, estimated to be about $1.5 
billion through 2003, climbed because of higher costs associated with 
workforce reductions. ChevronTexaco has cut about 2,000 jobs out of 
the 4,500 it has planned. Merger expenses of $1.17 billion included 
about $700 million for the workforce reduction, $300 million for the 
relocation and closing of offices, and $150 million from the sale of 
assets. It now expects its total costs from the $45.8 billion merger 
to rise by a third to $2 billion. ChevronTexaco also wrote-off the 
$100 million cost of a computer program. In the 4th quarter, 
ChevronTexaco's oil and natural gas production climbed to 1.8 million 
barrels of oil equivalent per day from 1.74 million. Income from 
refining, marketing and transportation business slid 57% to $215 
million from $498 million. The price ChevronTexaco received for its 
oil was down 39% to $16.95 in the 4th-quarter and natural gas fell to 
$2.27 per MMcf from $5.62. Sales of gasoline and refined products 
slipped 3% to 1.65 million bpd. Operating losses from ChevronTexaco's 
chemical joint venture with Phillips Petroleum increased to $17 
million last quarter from $13 million a year ago, due to a drop in 
chemical profit margins. The company wrote down the value of oil and 
natural gas producing properties by $1.4 billion because of a price 
drop in the quarter. It also lowered the value of assets in its 
chemical unit and properties that were deemed as unprofitable to 
develop by $452 million. Excluding special items, ChevronTexaco's 4th 
quarter earnings would have been $498 million, or $0.47 per share, 
almost half of analysts average estimates of $0.90 per share.

Marathon Posts $898 Million Loss 

    Marathon Oil has reported a 4th quarter loss of $898 million, or 
$2.90 per share, from $310 million or $1 per share a year ago, as a 
weak economy and mild temperatures sliced demand for oil and natural 
gas. Revenue fell to $6.85 billion from $8.05 billion, or 15%. 
Marathon, was split into a separate company after parent USX spun off 
its steel business. USX changed its name to Marathon and will focus 
on oil and natural gas production and refining. It took charges of 
$996 million in the 4th quarter, mainly due to its split from USX's 
steel business. Excluding the charges, profit would have been $98 
million, or $0.32 per share. The average estimate of analysts was 
$0.41. Profit from oil and natural gas production plunged 71% to $117 
million. Earnings from refining crude oil, transportation and 
marketing dropped 28%, to $221 million.
