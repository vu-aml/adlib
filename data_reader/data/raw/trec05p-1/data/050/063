Debra,
We are only showing that 4 producers need renegotiation letters:  Kennedy and MTG (notice by Nov. 1) and Quantum and Coleman (notice by October 1).  These are based off of the "Initial Pricing" term which was 2 years from "In service date" (Dec. 1, 1999).

I show Wellstar and Phillips (Petrogulf) are expiring in Dec. 02 and Independent expires Dec. 03.

Also, I noticed you set up the Phillips agreement as Petrogulf. Do you have the assignments from Petrogulf to Phillips?  I can fax those to you if you need them.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.
Theresa

(I'll take a look at the September confirms by this afternoon.)

 Please note I did not find an address for Coleman in our files.  Also, I have not prepared letters for Howell Petroleum and North Central Oil Corporation.
