INVESTMENT ANAYSIS........... 

In Vivo Medical Diagnostics, Inc. (Stock Symbol OTC: IVVO)
Short-Term Target: $2.80
12-Month Target: $4.20
Recommendations: Very Strong Buy
Long Term Outlook: Excellent 

In Vivo Medical Diagnostics, Inc (Stock Symbol OTC: IVVO) is finalizing its first ground-breaking portable medical device,
the Prothrombin Time Monitor, that measures changes in the magnetic fields of blood on a molecular level. 
This is critical for patients undergoing anticoagulation therapy after heart attacks and strokes.
This measurement is now portable and is used in real time to achieve optimal medication levels,
which is essential for successful treatment. IVVO has recently announced their joint effort with Inverness Medical Innovations
a leading manufacturer and marketer of rapid diagnostic products in order to complete development of the Prothrombin Time Monitor for its clinical trials.
Prothrombin Testing is a massive market and continues to grow with projections in excess of $150 million in 2005 and over $500 million by 2010.
IVVO is poised to capitalize on this significant opportunity. Don’t miss out on the near term upside potential in IVVO!
