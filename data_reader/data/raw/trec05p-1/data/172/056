Dear Jeffrey:

Start the year off right -- at a great price -- with
a subscription to VentureWire Professional and an
invaluable piece of research from us.

As a subscriber to VentureWire Alert, you know the value
of being up to date about private companies and private
capital. For the rest of this year you can subscribe to
the broader, deeper, and searchable version of our daily
news service, VentureWire Professional at the special
rate of only $445, a savings of 28% off our regular price.

As a bonus, you'll get a free copy of the brand-new $295
study from VentureWire Research: New Venture Funds 2001.
This report, which is being published this week,
identifies the dozens of funds that raised a total of more
than $50 billion in capital this year. It provides complete
information about focus and contacts.

To take advantage of our holiday offer (for products worth
$915 together) follow this link:

You already rely on VentureWire for private company news;
now's the time to make sure that next year you'll have all
the tools and information you need to continue building
your company.

Sincerely,
Brian O'Connell
