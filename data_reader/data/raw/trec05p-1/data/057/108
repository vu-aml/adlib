This is my response to Joan and then her response to that. Very interesting. 
Are you aware of any of this?

Hi Sandy,

Yes, indeed, that letter is troubling but no news to me.  Unfortunately, I
was shown a life-changing movie by a friend about a year ago called Panama
Deception.  It shows a typical action by the CIA, the invasion of Panama.
What is most important to me is the word "deception," because the movie goes
on to show how our news media covered the "event."  There is Dan Rather
sitting at his news desk saying somberly, "Two American lives were lost."
He neglects to mention that our unprovoked attack on the neighborhoods of
Panama City killed 3-4000 Panamanians.  Hardly anyone I talk to is aware of
this incident.  

In the process of trying to find my own copy of Panama Deception, which I
now know can be ordered through Amazon Books or from the Empowerment Project
(just do a search for Panama Deception on your computer)  I encountered
another film called "Everything I Have Learned About US Foreign Policy" or
something like that.  It is available just for the cost of copying the video
from a man named Frank Dorrel.  He is just a delivery man in So Cal who put
together this video from exerpts from a bunch of movies including Panama
Deception, a film with Bill Moyers, and others.  Ramsay Clark is on the film
and other people who have intimate knowledge of the CIA.  It is excellent.
He will send it to you for free or for a donation of any amount.  I believe
that we all need to know what is going on so that we can offer information
in our daily conversations that will slow down this ultra-patriotism and
cause people to consider the whole picture. Just as I wrote From the Redwood
Forest to serve as a tool for people to pass on to other people, I am
viewing the passing on of word about Frank Dorrel's film as one small thing
I can do to make a difference.  Since I began this effort, I have gotten two
people, including a busy orthopedic surgeon in Virginia, to join my efforts
and make people aware of this powerful film.

One thing I do when I load out my two copies is to fast forward the tape to
the exerpt from Panama Deception.  Then I suggest that people, after the
have watched PD, rewind and watch the video from the beginning.  Panama
Deception won an Academy Award in 1993 for Best Documentary, yet it has been
virtually banned in the US.  Even PBS will not show it.

I just got a call from a friend who has one of my Frank Dorrel movies on
loan.  She watched it last night and said, simply, "Scathing!"  She is going
to order her own copies and start promoting the film.

Frank Dorrel's email address is fdorrel@hotmail.com.  Mention my name so
that he will realize that the very generous package of material that he sent
me is going to good use.

I'm so thrilled that you are so settled back in your house in New Hampshire
and relieved to know that you will now have a friend right next door.  What
a comfort this will be. Community, no matter how small, is so important.

Be well,

Love, Joan
