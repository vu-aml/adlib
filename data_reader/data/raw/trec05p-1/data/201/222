The Royal Tenenbaums <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JKNH/ref=th_em_lnch_3/1317951> 
 <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/detail/r.gif>Gene Hackman, Gwyneth Paltrow 
Royal Tenenbaum had three children--all geniuses. And when this absentee father returns one winter, with an unexpected revelation, the Tenenbaums find that genius doesn't help any in reuniting a dysfunctional family. From Wes Anderson, the director of Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/761200/ref=mk_del_166895_0/> is the hilarious story of a family of brilliant eccentrics--and how they got that way. Golden Globe® nominee Gene Hackman stars, along with Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, and Bill Murray.

 <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JKNH/ref=th_em_lnch_2/1317951> Now Playing: The Royal Tenenbaums
The Royal Tenenbaums <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JKNH/ref=th_em_lnch_3/1317951> 
 <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/detail/r.gif>Gene Hackman, Gwyneth Paltrow 
Royal Tenenbaum had three children--all geniuses. And when this absentee father returns one winter, with an unexpected revelation, the Tenenbaums find that genius doesn't help any in reuniting a dysfunctional family. From Wes Anderson, the director of Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/761200/ref=mk_del_166895_0/> is the hilarious story of a family of brilliant eccentrics--and how they got that way. Golden Globe® nominee Gene Hackman stars, along with Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, and Bill Murray.
