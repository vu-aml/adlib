I'm guessing no.  Government bills aren't numbered as indicated below.  The current Senate bill 602 is the "Common Sense Federal Election Reform Act of 2001"; current House bill 602 is "Genetic Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act."  No email stuff in either one, I would assume.  The only email related bill is HR2281 "The Digital Divide Elimination Act of 2001."  This relates to tax credits to help lower-income people buy computers.  I can't find a record of any "Representative Tony Schnell."  I would also note that the Washington magazine is a monthly, not a weekly as suggested below.

Also, most "PLEASE FORWARD TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW!!!" emails are hoaxes.  This was a fun test- got any more?!
