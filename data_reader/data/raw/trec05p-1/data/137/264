I know you cannot control this.  If we can say anything to give our side of the story, we should.  Grigsby should know that the customer is a little pissed.

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.
