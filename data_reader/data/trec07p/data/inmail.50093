I think that it breaks.

I believe that this assumption is endemic in Perl 5, and it's never hindered
Perl 5's portability. The C FAQ gives examples of platforms where NULL is not
all bits zero - http://c-faq.com/null/machexamp.html - and I've never
encountered anyone using them.

(As an aside, I think that Perl 5 also (mostly?) doesn't assume 2s complement
storage of integers. IIRC a bug report from a Ahmdal mainframes gave the
impression that it was using sign and magnitude. However, we've not heard
about anyone using Ahmdal mainframes in years. Likewise no-one has missed the
removal of memory model support from Configure, so presumably no-one is
compiling on a PDP-11 anymore. We did discover nasal daemons, or something
similarly painful, on Irix64, until we removed assumptions about signed
integer overflow. (It's undefined behaviour. It will bite))
