---- Original Msg from: JULIAN MANN, DIRECT CAPITAL SECUR At:  8/29  9:45

A missionary who had spent years showing a tribe of natives how to
farm and build things to be self-sufficient gets word that he is to
return home.  He realizes that the one thing he never taught the
natives was how to speak English, so he takes the chief for a walk in
the forest.

He points to a tree and says to the chief, "This is a tree."

The chief looks at the tree and grunts, "Tree."

The missionary is pleased with the response.  They walk a little
farther and the missionary points to a rock and says, "This is a
rock."


Hearing this, the chief looks and grunts, "Rock."

The missionary is really getting enthusiastic about the results when
he hears a rustling in the bushes.  As he peeks over the top, he sees
a couple of natives in the midst of heavy sexual activity.

The missionary is really flustered and quickly responds, "Riding a
bike."

The chief looks at the couple briefly, pulls out his blow gun and
kills them.




The missionary goes ballistic and yells at the chief that he has spent

years teaching the tribe how to be civilized and kind to each other,
so how could he kill these people in cold blood that way?

The chief replied, "My bike."
