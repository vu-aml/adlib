Chris and Kieth: Thought cam to me after I talked to you guys regarding 
BOOGER motor. Chris, was that spincast the one with the bent up aluminum 
housing on the inside??? If it is, that is the one that I sent to get 
repaired. I have a feeling that it is not. I think it might be the motor 
that was at the mesquite flat last year. If it is, that motor has a week 
spin motor and occationally would get stuck by slight resistance from corn, 
but the clock would still work fine. If that is the one that is now at 
booger, pulling the guts and replacing it will do nothing. It is the spin 
motor that needs to be replaced. If it is the one that is all muddy, it is 
the one that was at gray box last year and got trashed by the coons at the 
end of last year. It looked like it was working, but apparently is not.

Talk to each other and see if you can figure out which one it is.

Doing a count of feeders, I think there is still one Magnum black photo box 
in the trailer and I know there are two green tubes. I think our best option 
may be to put a magunum on booger with a conversion (free) and shelf the 
spincast or confirm what is wrong with it before we dump more $ into another 
one of those piece of shit motors.

Please advise on your thoughts. e.
