Mark,

"Godav" to you too. And great to hear from you again.

Yes, certainly the world has changed since we last met. As it turned out I was 
in the Enron building in London when it all happened on Sep 11. And to all of 
us in London, that moment has been as defining as it has been to you in the 
States. 

- With one exception: We have had terrorism here for a very long time. So much 
so that I have learned to tell the difference between the sounds of an IRA 
semtex bomb and a Palestinian fertiliser one...

And life goes on. I keep reminding everybody how many people die in the traffic 
every day, and that I shall have to go someday anyway. So even though London 
probably is high on the hit list, I have not changed my lifestyle significantly.

Now it looks like EBS definitively is closing down in Europe. Personally if 
find it a shame, since I rather valued the people in the group, but probably it 
was inevitable.

But I am pleased that you have moved into the Oil and Gas part of Enron. 
Whatever the current woes of Enron Corp, that sector is doing fine as a whole.

My own stray into telecomms components did not last long. I was out after 3 
months on the back of completely collapsing sales in the US.

Now I have ventured into Executive Search, where I am working as COO for a 
small group with 70 staff in 10 countries. I am not "hunting" myself, but 
rather involved in corporate issues such as reporting contracts and business 
development. We are hoping to place some Eastern European engineers into a 
Houston company before long, but I am not expecting to have to go there for 
some time to come.

You may notice that I am sending this e-mail from a new address. I am trying to 
face out the old one, since it has caused me endless problems. So in future 
please use the new one: martin@heelas-joergensen.com (heelas being my wife's 
maiden name).

I am very pleased to hear that you are well, but would rather hope that you 
could find an excuse to come to London, even if your pipelines do not reach 
that far...


All the best,


Martin
