Jim:

It may be worth a call with CC Pace prior to the meeting to make sure we have the right people on line to answer their questions (e.g. trading).

Regards,
Brian

We tentatively have a conference call meeting set up in EB3567 with Texas Independent Energy (Byron Gannaway and Phillip Schnorbach) and representaives for CC Pace on Monday at 10 AM regarding the release of Enron from the guaranty and the assignment to AEP of the Guadelupe Power Partners gas supply agreement .  Byron Gannaway is currently lining up the folks on his side.  Our alternative date, if Monday cannot work, is Tuesday at 10 AM.  Per Janet Wallis, Byron Gannaway and TIE is totally on board with the assignment and release and the only thing outstanding is for CC Pace to provide their consent.  Thus the primary purpose of the meeting is to answer any and all questions that CC Pace may have and to work out a deadline for their consent.  Please let Lisa Lunz know ASAP if you cannot attend either Monday or Tuesday at 10AM.

Thanks
