NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 12/21/01
Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/21/01
A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Donald Hayes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/21/01
Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17. 

Chris Weinke <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 12/21/01
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 12/21/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.

Rich Gannon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 12/21/01
Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched. 

Randy Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.

Marvin Minnis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.

Rod Gardner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable. 

Tony Richardson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1471&>, RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 12/21/01
Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.

Trent Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 12/21/01
Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/21/01
Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason. 

Johnnie Morton <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1223&>, WR DET - Hunter Updated 12/21/01
Morton has been inconsistent this season but he will still be a solid No. 2 during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup.

Reggie Wayne <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement. But he is not accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams. 

Amani Toomer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1262&> , WR NYG - Tori Updated 12/21/01
Toomer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2 wideout during your playoffs.

Marvin Harrison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1231&>, WR IND - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not in the playoff race. 

Duce Staley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 12/21/01
Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs. 

Shawn Bryson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=133240&>, RB BUF - Neal/McKay Updated 12/21/01
Bryson will start in place of the injured Travis Henry this week. Consider him as a No. 2 RB if you need help at that spot. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Thrash was not very consistent during the regular season and may not catch a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season. He will be a No. 2 wideout at best during the Fantasy playoffs. 

David Patten <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1790&>, WR NE - JWillie Updated 12/21/01
Patten's numbers have dropped off in recent weeks. Don't use him unless your team is very thin at wide receiver. 

Joey Galloway <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Galloway has been a disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. Unless you're in a deeper league, starting Galloway during your playoffs isn't recommended. 

Troy Brown <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 12/21/01
Brown has been an inconsistent Fantasy receiver this year. He may not be a reliable option during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 12/21/01
Dunn has been inconsistent this season. He will be a No. 2 back at best during your playoffs. 

Antowain Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 12/21/01
Smith is a must-start player during the Fantasy postseason. Even if his yardage totals aren't good, he is a tremendous TD threat. 

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 12/21/01
Johnson has caught a lot of passes this season, but has only one TD reception. Nevertheless, he will still be a reliable receiver in your playoffs.

Anthony Becht <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=187740&> , TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Becht hasn't been a consistent target for the Jets this year. He may not be very valuable during the Fantasy playoffs.
