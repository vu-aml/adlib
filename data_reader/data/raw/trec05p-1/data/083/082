On the analyst call, have not listened to it yet.

Wanda mention about the call.   Do not know anything else.     

I'll see Lisa in a few minutes and ask about the reschedule on PG&E.

Missed the analyst call.  What was your take?  And you hearing that Lay's calling Edison today?

Best,
Jeff
