Audrey and Steve --
 
From your Start menu select Programs, Business Applications, TW -- you should have several apps under that.  You must select each app and wait for the install.  Should only take a few minutes and will only happen the first time or after application updates.  Give me a call if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Jean   cell 713-859-6238
 
I am out of office on vacation today... but feel free to give me a call if you have questions.
 
 
Blackberry Update:
 
Since we are having problems getting the actual hardware for the Blackberry devices, Corp is providing us with one.  I asked Karon to give the Corp team the info required and they are working on changing the "owner" info.  Hopefully, you should have it today or tomorrow.  I have already sent Karon a follow-up email to check the status.
