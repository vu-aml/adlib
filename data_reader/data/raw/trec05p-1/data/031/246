I just thought I'd drop a note about the trip.  I think it was the best Enron offsite I have attended.  I thought the focus on interacting was very good and worked better than past golfing events and Vegas trips.  The event was also very well organized and the host/hostess were excellent. 

Thank you.

Cheers
Kyle
