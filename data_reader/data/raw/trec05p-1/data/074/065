Latest NFL Player News 

Redskins  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=30&>, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
Defensive end Bruce Smith, who was knocked out of Sunday's game against the Giants with a dislocated right shoulder, will miss two to three weeks while the tissue in his right shoulder heals and he regains his strength and range of motion. You shouldn't be using the Redskins' defense on a weekly basis in a Fantasy league to begin with. 

Keyshawn Johnson  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1265&>, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/08/01 
Johnson suffered a shoulder contusion when it was driven into the ground during the fourth quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay. He should be fine for Week Five, but see how he fares in practice before making a decision on starting him next week. 

Tiki Barber  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01 
The Giants said that Barber should be able to return from a hamstring injury next Sunday in St. Louis. However, it is unclear whether he will get the majority of the carries over Ron Dayne, so be careful starting either unless the Giants' RB picture clears up by then. 

Ron Dayne  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01 
Dayne left Sunday's game against Washington with a neck stinger, an injury which the Giants said was not serious. He should be able to play next Sunday in St. Louis. 

Corey Bradford  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=12234&>, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
Bradford left Sunday's game in Tampa Bay with cramps after returning a kickoff. He will be re-evaluated on Monday. 

Ryan Leaf  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=12506&>, QB TB - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
The Cowboys remain interest in Leaf despite ligament damage in his wrist, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram . They may sign him to the roster and place him on injured reserve. Leaf offers no Fantasy value at this stage of his career. 

Quincy Carter  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=235201&>, QB DAL - Dont Mess Updated 10/08/01 
Carter said the next 48 hours would determine whether he will be able to play a week from Monday against Washington, according to The Dallas Morning News . He has a strained left hamstring that he said he felt pop during the first quarter of Sunday's game. Carter isn't a recommended Fantasy starter even when healthy. 

Matt Hasselbeck  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01 
Hasselbeck (groin) missed Seattle's win over Jacksonville and watched Trent Dilfer lead the team to 24 points. Still, Mike Holmgren claimed the injured Hasselbeck will remain Seattle's starter. "I said it before and I'll say it again," Holmgren told the Seattle Times . "Matt Hasselbeck is our quarterback." Hasselbeck's status for Seattle's next game is unclear. 

Laveranues Coles  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/08/01 
Coles sprained his ankle at Buffalo. The injury is not considered to be serious. 

Terry Glenn  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1254&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
Glenn is eligible to start practicing, but the Patriots have applied for a roster exemption so he can get into playing shape. Don't expect him to be a solid contributor to the New England passing game in the near future. When he will make his return to the lineup is still unclear. 

Ray Lucas  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1418&>, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01 
Lucas appeared in short-yardage sets on Sunday. He still won't play often enough to affect Jay Fiedler's numbers. 

Kevin Kasper  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=235097&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
Kasper suffered a severely sprained right ankle on Sunday and will miss three to six weeks. Travis McGriff or Chris Cole might see more time in the passing game while Kasper is out. 

Rickey Dudley  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1357&>, TE CLE - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01 
Dudley played with a sprained foot on Sunday. He is not expected to miss any playing time. 

Patrick Johnson  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=12477&>, WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
Johnson is expected to miss eight weeks with a clavicle injury. He had already started to fall behind the emerging Travis Taylor as a preferred target in the passing game. 

Chris Weinke  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/08/01 
Weinke was extremely ineffective against the Niners Sunday. He completed only 29 of 47 passes for 275 yards. Three of his incompletions resulted in interceptions while he threw only one touchdown pass. Weinke was effective in the season opener but has proven to be a Fantasy reserve at best. 

Wesley Walls  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01 
Walls proved to be quarterback Chris Weinke's best target Sunday against the 49ers catching 10 passes for 91 yards and a score. Walls won't do this every week but he will get a lot of looks from Weinke when he can't find his receivers. 

Terrell Owens  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1290&>, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01 
Owens was productive once again on Sunday, catching eight passes for 118 yards and two scores. Look for him to do well next week against Atlanta. 

Garrison Hearst  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1164&>, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 10/08/01 
Hearst did not score but provided decent production Sunday against the Panthers gaining 74 yards on 18 carries. He is not starter material at this point but will be a good backup in most Fantasy leagues. 

Jeff Garcia  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=146325&>, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01 
Garcia was solid once again in Sunday's game against the Panthers. He threw for 212 yards and two touchdown passes against only one interception. 

Aaron Brooks  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=133233&>, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/08/01 
Brooks turned in his second consecutive mediocre performance Sunday. He only threw for 210 yards with an interception and no touchdown passes. Brooks has struggled in the last two games but the Saints will stick with him as the starter since they are winning games. 

Michael Vick  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=235253&>, QB ATL - Really Rottens Updated 10/08/01 
Vick was an adequate replacement for the injured Chris Chandler but he failed to lead the Falcons to the end zone. He completed 12 of 18 passes for 186 yards and also gained 23 yards on four carries. Look for Vick to return to the bench next week. 

Patrick Jeffers  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1515&>, WR CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01 
Jeffers (knees) missed Sunday's game against San Francisco. He continues to make progress in his recovery from multiple knee surgeries, but isn't ready to return to action just yet. 

Kevan Barlow  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=235019&>, RB SF - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01 
Barlow recently revealed that he is playing with a quadriceps injury that has hampered his ability since training camp. "It happened, what, two months ago? And it probably won't heal until the offseason. I just have to work through it," Barlow told The San Francisco Chronicle . "People don't know how bad this is hurting." Barlow will continue to play but the injury might prevent him from taking over as the full-time running back. Keep him on your bench for now. 

Shawn Jefferson  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Uran Man Updated 10/08/01 
Jefferson missed most of the second half of Sunday's game due to neck and back injuries. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. Receivers Terance Mathis, Brian Finneran and Quentin McCord will be the wideouts next week if he is inactive. 

Nick Goings  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=237114&>, RB CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 10/08/01 
Goings was inactive for Sunday's game as Tim Biakabutuka resumed his job as the starting running back. Keep Goings on your bench for now. 

Tim Biakabutuka  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1082&>, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01 
Biakabutuka started Sunday's game after being benched a week earlier. He wasn't too effective gaining 45 yards on 10 rushes. Biakabutuka also caught two passes for 22 yards. Keep Biakabutuka on your bench if you have depth at running back. 

Chris Chandler  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
Chandler left Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. The injury was diagnosed as a Grade 1 concussion, the least severe on the scale. He is listed as day to day. Michael Vick will start next Sunday if he is unable to play. 

J.J. Stokes  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1292&>, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/08/01 
Stokes sprained his knee in Sunday's game, but stayed in the contest. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. Stokes had just one catch in the game for six yards. 

Laveranues Coles  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/07/01 
Coles caught five passes for 77 yards and carried the ball two times for 15 yards at Buffalo. Coles has apparently become an important part of the New York offense in his second pro season. 

Anthony Becht  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=187740&>, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01 
Becht caught three passes for 21 yards and a TD at Buffalo. Despite some early struggles, Becht still appears to be an key member of the New York passing game on third downs and near the goal line.
