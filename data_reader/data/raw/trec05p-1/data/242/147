sounds like a great time molly i m in md so let s do it but what if i can t keep my hands to myself?
gg - lieberman s an idiot saddam had been contained for a decade and al qaeda didn t have a strong foothold in iraq until bush launched this war.
i gotta come out against registration honestly it really doesnt help the troll problem much - see the forums which are pretty full of trolls.
understand well dean clones your man will lose and this is a big reason why only the most strident radical child-hating human rights-hating fanatic is for partial birth abortion absolutely disgusting.
i really think that it is a conspired effort to shut down the dialog and campaign coordination here.
dean doesn t deserve to win and anyone who follows him after all that he s said and done this past month deserves what they will get should dean get the nomination--four more years of george bush.
on sunday afternoon i received a phone call form a clark supporter from wisocnsin and monday my husband received an messy postcard from john kerry campaign just name no address.
i am going to take a cue from howard dean and jimmy carter and spend sunday morning praying and meditating.
if dean wins the nomination and wins the election you guys are toast and you ll take mcauliffe down with you.
it s people like this that really have no patriotism no congratulations for the troops just instant political bashing of the opposing candidate i m not surprised by this but it still sickens me.
congrats to the troops on the capture of saddam he was an evil man and deserves to be put on public trial.
this is pretty cool just a nice relaxing way ok- maybe competitive way? to get dean supporters together weekly to talk about things in the boston area great website too!
bush mr champagne brigade mr awol a war hero ? i m glad tonight s trolls have a sense of humor.
