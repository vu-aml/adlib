            Tonogold Resources, Inc. Announces Acquisition of
                         Victory Divide Claims
                        at Tonopah Divide, Nevada

        LA JOLLA, CA--(MARKET WIRE)--Jun 29, 2007 -- Tonogold
        Resources, Inc. (Other OTC:TNGL.PK - News) has signed a
        lease agreement for an additional 56 acres of
        contiguous patented mining claims just south of
        Tonopah, Nevada.

        These claims are located near the center of Tonogold's
        Tonopah Divide Gold and Silver Project. The Victory
        Divide claims may include bulk-mineable exploration
        targets in the hanging wall of the shallow
        north-dipping, well-mineralized, district-scale
        Kernick-Gold Zone fault zone.

        The Victory Divide claims were actively mined by pick
        and shovel from 1946 to 1948. Tonogold is in the
        process of retrieving past production and exploration
        data.

          A short video of the mining operation from 1946-1948

        Tonogold Resources, Inc. Announces Initial Work Program
        at Tonopah Divide Gold Project

        LA JOLLA, CA -- May 25, 2007 -- Tonogold Resources,
        Inc. (Other OTC:TNGL.PK - News) has hired Rich Bybee to
        compile data and delineate new gold and gold-silver
        deposits within the re-consolidated Tonopah Divide
        District.

        Tonogold Resources has now completed its consolidation
        program for the Tonopah Divide District. Richard Bybee
        has agreed to evaluate the existing data and direct new
        exploration.

        Mr. Bybee is familiar with the Tonopah Divide District,
        and brings over thirty years of exploration experience
        related to volcanic-associated gold and gold-silver
        deposits. His expertise worldwide in surface and
        underground exploration, and drill project management,
        will be invaluable for the Tonopah Divide Project.

        Donald Strachan, Tonogold's Vice President of
        Exploration, said: "Never before have the District's
        several target areas been under consolidated ownership
        or subjected to the level of exploration expertise now
        brought to bear by Mr. Bybee."

        The most recent drilling program, conducted by Phelps
        Dodge in 1997, revealed continuous, anomalous gold in
        oxidized drill intercepts up to 160 feet in thickness.
        Mr. Bybee is analyzing existing records and intends to
        confirm the data in the field and to create an updated
        district-scale GIS database. Upon completion of his
        review of the data, Mr. Bybee will direct a
        district-wide, structurally sensitive, geochemical
        sampling program.

        Richard Bybee stated, "The results of this sample work
        would be to provide an understanding of specific
        structural controls, if any, to the gold mineralization
        and to aid in interpreting the existing drill data. The
        goal is to identify new drill targets with bulk-tonnage
        potential and better understand the existing resource
        blocks that have been calculated by previous work."

        Jeff Janda, President of Tonogold, said: "Mr. Bybee's
        initial work program will be an important first step in
        confirming the geologic potential of 1 to 2 M oz of Au
        and 10 to 50 M oz of Ag at open pit depths suggested by
        the Dilles report."

           Tonogold Resources, Inc. Releases Drill Intercepts
                           Indicating Thick,
               Oxidized, Anomalous Gold at Tonopah Divide

        LA JOLLA, CA--(MARKET WIRE)--Mar 22, 2007 -- Tonogold
        Resources, Inc. (Other OTC:TNGL.PK - News) is pleased
        to announce the release of historic drill data
        indicating thick, oxidized, anomalous gold at the
        Tonopah Divide Gold Project in Esmeralda County,
        Nevada.

        Thick gold-bearing drill intercepts of mineralized
        volcanics have recently been uncovered in data from
        Tonogold's Divide project. Drilled and released by
        Phelps Dodge Corporation (PD) in 1997 when gold prices
        were in a downturn, data from three drill holes on
        Tonogold's property have been resurrected. The three
        angle holes were drilled at wide spacings within the
        Amazon patent claim, a property recently added to
        Tonogold's holdings in the Divide District near
        Tonopah, Nevada. Anomalous gold is continuous in the
        oxidized drill intercepts up to 160 feet long (see
        tables below).

        Tonogold's concept for the Divide project is to outline
        a stand-alone heap-leachable resource on their
        currently held properties, while continuing to acquire
        adjacent mineral rights. A successful Tonopah Divide
        project could develop bulk-tonnage oxide potential of
        up to two million ounces from low-grade,
        heap-leachable, disseminated gold mineralization.
        Higher grades are expected at depth on the east-west
        Kernick-Gold Zone fault and two intersecting
        northwesterly faults, structural "feeders" related to
        Divide's shallow oxide gold mineralization.

        Tonogold plans to run a tight, detailed geophysical
        grid over the Divide District in mid-2007 followed by
        drilling to increase grades and expand the known
        mineralized volumes, beginning with the Amazon area and
        the major structural zones.

        Jeff Janda, President of Tonogold Resources, Inc.,
        stated, "These drill intercepts add credence to the one
        to two million ounces of gold exploration potential
        outlined in the report by Pete Dilles last year."

<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">Tonogold Resources, Inc. Announces
Initial Work Program at Tonopah Divide Gold Project</font></b>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>LA JOLLA, CA -- May 25,
2007 -- Tonogold Resources, Inc. (Other OTC:TNGL.PK - News) has hired Rich
Bybee to compile data and delineate new gold and gold-silver deposits within
the re-consolidated Tonopah Divide District.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>Tonogold Resources has
now completed its consolidation program for the Tonopah Divide District.
Richard Bybee has agreed to evaluate the existing data and direct new exploration.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>Mr. Bybee is familiar
with the Tonopah Divide District, and brings over thirty years of exploration
experience related to volcanic-associated gold and gold-silver deposits.
His expertise worldwide in surface and underground exploration, and drill
project management, will be invaluable for the Tonopah Divide Project.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>Donald Strachan, Tonogold's
Vice President of Exploration, said: "Never before have the District's
several target areas been under consolidated ownership or subjected to
the level of exploration expertise now brought to bear by Mr. Bybee."</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>The most recent drilling
program, conducted by Phelps Dodge in 1997, revealed continuous, anomalous
gold in oxidized drill intercepts up to 160 feet in thickness. Mr. Bybee
is analyzing existing records and intends to confirm the data in the field
and to create an updated district-scale GIS database. Upon completion of
his review of the data, Mr. Bybee will direct a district-wide, structurally
sensitive, geochemical sampling program.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>Richard Bybee stated,
"The results of this sample work would be to provide an understanding of
specific structural controls, if any, to the gold mineralization and to
aid in interpreting the existing drill data. The goal is to identify new
drill targets with bulk-tonnage potential and better understand the existing
resource blocks that have been calculated by previous work."</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>Jeff Janda, President
of Tonogold, said: "Mr. Bybee's initial work program will be an important
first step in confirming the geologic potential of 1 to 2 M oz of Au and
10 to 50 M oz of Ag at open pit depths suggested by the Dilles report."</font></font>

Drill Intercepts Indicating Thick,&nbsp;</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">Oxidized, Anomalous Gold at Tonopah
Divide</font></b></center>

<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>LA JOLLA, CA--(MARKET
WIRE)--Mar 22, 2007 -- Tonogold Resources, Inc. (Other OTC:TNGL.PK - News)
is pleased to announce the release of historic drill data indicating thick,
oxidized, anomalous gold at the Tonopah Divide Gold Project in Esmeralda
County, Nevada.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>Thick gold-bearing drill
intercepts of mineralized volcanics have recently been uncovered in data
from Tonogold's Divide project. Drilled and released by Phelps Dodge Corporation
(PD) in 1997 when gold prices were in a downturn, data from three drill
holes on Tonogold's property have been resurrected. The three angle holes
were drilled at wide spacings within the Amazon patent claim, a property
recently added to Tonogold's holdings in the Divide District near Tonopah,
Nevada. Anomalous gold is continuous in the oxidized drill intercepts up
to 160 feet long (see tables below).</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>Tonogold's concept for
the Divide project is to outline a stand-alone heap-leachable resource
on their currently held properties, while continuing to acquire adjacent
mineral rights. A successful Tonopah Divide project could develop bulk-tonnage
oxide potential of up to two million ounces from low-grade, heap-leachable,
disseminated gold mineralization. Higher grades are expected at depth on
the east-west Kernick-Gold Zone fault and two intersecting northwesterly
faults, structural "feeders" related to Divide's shallow oxide gold mineralization.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>Tonogold plans to run
a tight, detailed geophysical grid over the Divide District in mid-2007
followed by drilling to increase grades and expand the known mineralized
volumes, beginning with the Amazon area and the major structural zones.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>Jeff Janda, President
of Tonogold Resources, Inc., stated, "These drill intercepts add credence
to the one to two million ounces of gold exploration potential outlined
in the report by Pete Dilles last year."</font></font>
