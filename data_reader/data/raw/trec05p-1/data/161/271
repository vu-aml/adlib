	In reference to this weekend's activity, I contacted Bob Superty as to their plans for nominations and explained that payment must be received today to permit any transportation. My call was returned by Suzanne Calcagno who advised they were not in a position to make payment but hoped to know more next week. I advised that we would require the prepayment and she understood and appreciated our call.

	If any questions arise this weekend, please feel free to contact me.

	My phone numbers are Home - 281-320-2563
