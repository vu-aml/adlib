Pig,

Thanks for the message "No responses from anyone".  I guess I don't
count much these days.

OK...fine....did everyone get that? Fantastic. Who the f%^k is going
tomorrow, dammit? Where the HELL is Chad (Monkey-Noise Boy)? No
responses from anyone? Wake up MEN... I will be leaving the office
shortly, so call cell to RSVP...713-817-1661. I would prefer a 'thread"
until such time that I leave (one o'clockish).

I think it has to do w/ evolution of phrases.  In the 12th century,
the
phrase was "hairier than a butt tick" (which doesn't make sense unless
you
trace it back to days when man invented the three point stance), but
went
through a series of common usefulness in differing global regions,
ending in
Northern Iceland (where the women are beautiful, but it is very cold -
get
the idea?).  The phrase didn't change much from there until the Salem
Witch
Trials.  What I'm trying to figure out is how it ended-up at a rodeo.

Ok, hope that helps. I gotta get back to my oh-so-useful mgmt training
class.

Hare is correct...how about "cold as a witch's tit". What the hell is
that?
Someone said that last night at the rodeo and I'm still trying to
figure
that one out. Heard it many times before, but like you, have never
thought
to "overthink" such a quote. I'm very confused and getting angrier by
the
minute...

isn't it hide nor "hare"?  I really don't know, and can't make sense
out of
it all. I've been paying attention to phrases lately that just don't
make
sense.  Like chocolate thunderbolt, baby.  It's a stretch to make it
work,
but oh so fitting for the setting. 

Do you know what I want?

Man, now I'm upset.  My "buddy" up here said he'd get a group of his
"team"
together for that night as well.  After a few margaritas, it won't
really
matter what happens. C'mon, man. What?

I'll bring my pickle packets.

Make it happen, Chetuck. BTW...whatever happened to your reply about
our
impending "foursome"??? Very "excited"  about the opportunity...

OK...this is the final and definitive MAN NIGHT agenda...it WILL NOT
CHANGE,
heretofore.

Where?- Tampico Mexican Seafood.  610 to Airline...Right on Airline,
Go
about 4 blocks, you will pass the Farmers Market and just past that
will be
Tampico. Queried Zander again about it this morning and he said they DO
have
security and the clientele is an eclectic mix of Mexican day laborers
drinking Mexican beer and those little packets of salt and lime, dining
next
to large tables of rich blue-blood yuppie types...Good Fun. Kind of
like a
good noodle house or other oriental type place...if you see the
natives
eating there, you know it's good. Besides after listening to Joe and
Chet, I
would agree that Tony's is ABSOLUTELY OUT OF THE QUESTION.

When?- Thursday 2/28- 7:15 pm.

Who?- Head count is as follows...Piggy, Lease Nazi, Captain Safety,
Monkey-Noise Boy, Big Boy Chambers (?), Fenner-Weiner(?)

MEN...please RSVP such that we can appropriately "sign" to the
non-English
speaking staff how many Ritas we need to order upon arrival.

See you MEN at the MAN function, to do MAN-typical things.

								PIGGY

Eat me, Wollam.  Did you notice the "Out of Office" message from my
email,
home slice?

Not sure what the 20 "MAN NIGHT" emails are in my inbox from yesterday,
but
noted the Thurs. night dinner.  I have conflict which I will try to
unwind
for my attendance.  However, not sure that we want to be at Tony's on
such
night, based on what my co-worker says!
