Dear Anderson Alumni:

The Anderson Alumni Office has seen a tremendous outpouring
of concern for our alumni in New York and Washington, D.C.,
demonstrating the strength and compassion of our alumni
network. 

To keep everyone informed, we have created a Web site to
locate our alumni. The site is at our alumni home page:

         http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/alumni

To update our Web site, please e-mail Steve Lyon, our
assistant director for online services, at
slyon@anderson.ucla.edu.

We are very saddened to report that alumnus Christopher
Newton (EMBA '98) was a passenger on American Airlines
flight 77 out of Dulles.  Our thoughts and prayers go out
to his family and friends. 

Sincerely,
Bridget

NOTE: We are sending this e-mail to every alum for whom
we have an address in order to reach as many people as
possible; thank you for your understanding.
