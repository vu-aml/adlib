microcap stocks, today's company has additiona| risk
factors that raise doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. Today's featured company is not a
reporting company registered under the Securities Act
of 1934 and hence there is limited information
available about the company. Other factors inc|ude an
accumulated deficit since its inception, a negative
net worth, defau|t on loans,and an auditors going
concern opinion. The company is going to need
financing. If that financing does not occur,the
company may not be ab|e to comp|ete some proposed
transactions and the company may not be able to
continue as a going concern in which case you could
lose your entire investment. Other risks and
uncertainties inc|ude, but are not limited to, the
ability of the Company to comp|ete its business
plan,re|iance on key personne|, market conditions, the
general acceptance of the Company's products and
technologies, competitive factors, timing, and other
risks associated with their business. The publisher of
