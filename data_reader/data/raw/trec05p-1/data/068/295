Anne

I left the following in your office this morning:

1) Correspondence and Gregg Modeling inovice totalling $107,635.  We feel that this is an issue that AEP needs to settle directly with Gregg Engineering.

2) D.L. Peterson Trust invoice totalling $22,152 for a truck.   AEP has paid the invoice dated 5/24/01 and asked us for reimbursement.  However we see this as a non-emergency purchase right before close that was not properly authorized by Brian.  

Also attached is an updated Inventory and Working Capital Calculation Statement.  I have updated based on the change in the prime rate yesterday.

Call me at 3-5346 if you need anything else.

Jim
