STUDENT TO STUDENT (STS) AND HAAS ALUMNI JOB FAIR

When: 11/27 and 11/28 from 6:00 to 8:30
Where: B of A forum


If you or someone in your company has current openings that you think your 
peers in the Evening MBA program and Haas MBA alumni would be interested 
in, please plan on participating.

You can use this opportunity to earn a finders fee, if your company pays 
for employee referrals.  The job fair will be held on both Tuesday and 
Wednesday nights.  Ideally we would like you to participate both nights, if 
you can only attend one night that will be OK.  If you will be in class, I 
will set up your table and you can come during the break and be available 
to answer questions.  Other companies will be at their tables from 6-8:30.

There is no charge.  You or your companies' representative will staff the 
information table, disseminate company literature along with a list of 
current openings and be available to answer questions about the jobs/company.

If you are interested in hosting a table, please send all inquiries to John 
Morel at
morel@haas.berkelye.edu or give me a call (510) 642-7731.   The deadline 
for signing up is 11/21 at 12:00 noon.
