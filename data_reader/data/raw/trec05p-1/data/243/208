Dear Board Members and Attendees,

Attached please find supplemental materials for the meeting on March 8 in 
.pdf format, bookmarked.  The materials include an updated list of the 
letters of intent, the resolution and updated retail gas quadrant procedures 
and the resolution and updated retail electric quadrant procedures.  The 
ballot is contained in the board book under tab 8 for these two resolutions 
for Board members unable to attend the meeting.  

The board book can be found on our web site (http://www.naesb.org/bod.htm), 
and was also provided in paper form for the Board members.  If you need 
additional information or experience difficulty downloading the attached 
file, please call the NAESB office at (713) 356-0060.

Best Regards,  NAESB Office
