Sandra -

Honestly, no apology necessary whatsoever.  I also feel upset, angry and generally let down by upper-management on many issues.  Pride is as much of what makes me want to work for a company as anything else (including money) and I feel my pride has taken a big hit lately by all of the news.  I am still optimistic and am trying to look forward as we can only make sure this doesn't happen again.

Agaon, no apologies necessary,
Rogers

Where do I begin?  I guess I could start with several excuses or reasons to justify my behavior on Friday, but the truth is there aren't any.  I only am left with total humiliation and embarrassment for my actions, words, and behavior.  Please accept my sincere apology.

Sandra
