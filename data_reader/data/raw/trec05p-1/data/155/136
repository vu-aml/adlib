<FONT size=3> Hi there! My name is Elena, a 32 years old woman living here in
beautiful Russia. I am 5'6" tall with blonde hair and blue eyes. Here I am
looking for my Prince Charming who will be open-hearted, kind and caring not
only for me, but also for my cute daughter who is only 7, but smarter than
lots of adults. She is attending the school with English bias. We have a lot
of friends, but would like to meet a man who will be a loving husband and
father! If you are serious about our future relationship,
do write me today at <A href="mailto:cutesingle@SexMagnet.com">cutesingle@SexMagnet.com</A>. I do not
want to make this letter too long....
I hope to hear from you soon.
<BR>
We'll give you a chance ;) Bye-bye!<br>
Elena
