Please let me know if there are any EnronOnline trading-related matters you would like Global to address at our monthly status meeting tomorrow morning.  We would like to know if you have any feedback for us, if there is anything you wish we were doing differently, or if there is anything from the Credit and Legal departments that we should know.  

We will be meeting at 10:00 a.m. in ECN 791 and, as always, you are welcome to attend -- even if only for a few minutes.

Thanks,
Karen
