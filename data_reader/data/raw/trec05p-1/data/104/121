Spoke with Phil Levy regarding several issues.  He is immediately emailing FX amendment for the existing master and will simultaneously review the existing ISDA for FX coverage.  The executed amendment will resolve the margining issues ASAP.  ENA will produce a draft Schedule/CSA to begin negotiations for an upgraded master which will include multibranch parties.
