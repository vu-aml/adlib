Dear Friend.

What I relate to you via this message is very urgent
but I urge you to read on for your assistance. There
exists a dormant account belonging to a non-Swiss
indigene since World War II.

It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the
Swiss Banker's Association published a list of dormant
accounts originally opened by non-Swiss citizens.
These accounts had been dormant since the end of World
War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust
victims. The continuing efforts of various government
set up committees have since resulted in the discovery
of additional dormant accounts -54,000 in December,
1999. 

The published lists contain all types of dormant
accounts, including interest-bearing savings accounts,
securities accounts, safe deposit boxes, custody
accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction
accounts. Numbered accounts are also included.
Interest is paid on accounts that were interest
bearing when established. The Claims Tribunal handles
processing of all claims on accounts due non-Swiss
citizens. A dormant account holder (deceased) with a
credit balance of 21,000,000 US dollar plus
accumulated interest was discovered by me, in my bank.
The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era,
Leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of
heirs. The Claims Tribunal has been mandated to report
all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts
and transfer of existing credit balance into the
treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the
law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries
who died interstate (living no wills). 

Being a director in my bank, I have all secret details
and necessary contacts for claim of the funds without
any hitch. The funds will be routed via a private
financial facility, being a safe haven for the funds
and we can share the funds and use in investment of
our choice. Due to the sensitive nature of my job, I
need a foreigner to HELP claim the funds.
All that is required is for you to provide me with
your details for processing of the necessary legal and
administrative claim documents for transfer of the
funds to you, to this regard, you are expected to fill
out a text form. I will pay all required fees to
ensure that the fund is transferred to a secured,
numbered account in your name, where you will be
capable of accessing the funds and gradually
transfering to your country and other banks of choice
in the world. THERE IS NO RISK
INVOLVED. 

You can find additional information about unclaimed
funds at the following websites:
http://www.swissbankclaims.com www.wiesenthal.com

The Claims Processing Office has put funds in Escrow
awaiting submission of valid claims for necessary
disbursement. 

I find myself priviledged to have this information and
this is a great opportunity of a life time of success
without risks. Due to cautious reasons, reply via
email only. You may reply to me securely through this
email address (patrick.berger24@hotmail.ro )

I await your urgent response to this proposal,

My Regards

Mr. Patrick Berger
