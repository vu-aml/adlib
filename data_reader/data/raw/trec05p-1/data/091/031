Paul,

Hi.  On the Petrogulf deal, are you proposing Enron or Petrogulf gets the
tport contract on OTTCO?  I'm assuming right now the tport will be with
Enron.  I also assume you are purchasing Petrogulf's gas at the Jonah
delivery point into OTTCO since Petrogulf will have to use their Jonah
contract to get it through that system.  I think you said you wanted WIC
space for November and December.  How much are you talking about?  If it's
only Petrogulf you're purchasing, we're probably talking no more than
3mmcf/d.  Please confirm Monday a.m.  We'll be meeting sometime Monday
morning to go over the allocation at the Jonah JT skid (the point of
constraint on getting into OTTCO since it's beyond full) and our system
supply situation for OTTCO for November.  Remember Petrogulf will have to
sign a processing contract with Jonah for the JT skid.  If they plan to
process at Opal after the expansion is complete, they will have to put
together a deal with Williams or use yours, if you have one.

How special do you feel that I'm working on your deal on a Sunday
afternoon??
