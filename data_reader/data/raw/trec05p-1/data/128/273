On November 11, a fire destroyed the Gerber Compressor Station building on the Redwood Path, and that unit was taken out of service. Pipeline capacity on Redwood Path is reduced to 1,776 MMcf pending station repairs. California Gas Transmission estimates this capacity reduction will last approximately six months.
