Hi there!
If you have ever tried to make money on the internet, you probably know =
it's not easy. The internet offers huge opportunities, yet you have to =
come up with something unique anyway, the old tricks don't work for so =
long. In the following letter I'm offering you a product together with a =
business opportunity you have never come accross yet.

Please note:
This is NOT a chain-letter, MLM or a make-money-fast scheme. I'm =
offering you a resell pack with lots of useful tools for webmasters or =
anyone interested in making money on the internet (for further =
information, check out http://www.totalresale.com/), and an ebook, which =
is an easy step-by-step tutorial helping you to sell it.=20

You maybe came accross similar business ideas as this one, but those are =
usually illegal. While THIS is NOT!
The usual chain-letter tries to convince you of your fast and obvious =
success, which is a fraud. It is illegal. In this letter you will only =
find my own personal research results, and I don't give you any =
guarantee it will work. It's up to you, and it's up to all the people =
you will try to reach, to sell your product.
Your product will be the product I'm trying to sell you: because it =
comes with full resale rights. So you can sell it to others with full =
resale rights, too.

But the trick is you don't sell it directly to your customers, but it =
goes through another 5 agents, so you've got a chance to reach more =
people (Although if you like, you can also sell on your own - not using =
this form).
The similar kind of "chain-letters" would tell you to pay some money, =
then send the email on to another 20 people, 40 people, or x people, so =
out of them at least 5 will send it on. And on, and on n' on...=20
Wonder why it didn't work when you tried? Wonder why everyone is keep =
telling it's nonsense?

From my own experience I can tell you why: because out of 40-50, you =
wouldn't get 5 to pay and send a letter on. They probably even know it's =
illegal - NOT like this letter! -, so most of them deletes those =
straight away. The more people you send the letter to, the more chance =
you've got to reach the avarage 5% - who'll eventually get into that =
kind of game. You probably need to send out about a 100 emails or more, =
to get 5 people involved, or even 200 to be sure.
(Spamming is sending out letters to random email addresses, or to people =
who you are not sure would kindly receive it. It's the same as the pizza =
flyers you receive everyday in your mailbox. It's annoying, but not =
illegal, as long as you do not promise things that are not true, what =
would be a fraud.)

What I'm offering here is an ebook, which tells you how to send out that =
much of email, and another one, with all kind of webmaster tools for =
further marketing strategies. You'll need to use this letter as a form, =
to promote your product to more people through the system it involves.

You'll also need a PayPal account if you decide to buy the product, and =
to receive money of your sales. If you have an account already, you can =
skip to the next paragraph. If you don't, just go to www.paypal.com, and =
sign up for a premier account (you'll need to have an email address). =
You can only receive payments if you've got a premier or business =
account - with PayPal you can send money to any PayPal email address, or =
others can send money to your email. Once you signed up, you need to =
transfer money from your bank (My Account --> Add Funds), or get =
verified, so you can use your PayPal account to pay, continuously and =
without limits - otherwise you have to type your bank card numbers in =
all the time you want to purchase something. It takes some time, as they =
need to verify your bank details. But it's really simple - you can find =
all the instructions on the PayPal site, as you go through the process. =
Through PayPal you can pay in a ny currency, and it's one of the safest =
internet payment methods.

Now you are ready to pay for the ebooks. You'll find a list of emails =
under this paragraph. You have to pay only (US) $5 for the 2 ebooks, to =
the first email address (email address No. 1!). Then you can go to our =
download area (www.emg.inihu.com), where you'll find your purchased =
ebooks, ready to download. To log in to the members download area, =
you'll need to type in the email you sent the money to, and your email. =
It will go through a validation process, and in a few seconds, you can =
download your files. Please copy and paste the email address when =
sending the money - so you do not mistype. And write "ebook" to the =
email subject when paying on the PayPal site!

1. remedyofsun@yahoo.co.uk
2. brenda_lord@hotmail.com
3. johnny_thessano@hotmail.com
4. starndonbaya@yahoo.com
5. generalgerald@hotmail.com
6. stuart_leroy@hotmail.com

The last thing to do is to copy and paste all this letter to a text or =
word file, so you can later send it out to others. You also need to =
change the 1-6 email list. Delete the first name, and change No. 2. to =
No. 1., 3-to-2, 4 becomes 3, 5 will be 4, and 6 is 5. Into the next line =
you have to put "6." and your PayPal email address, to receive your =
money after reaching as many people as you are able to, with the help of =
all those you reached, and they reached, and so on...=20
Please do not change anything else in this letter, as it would break the =
flow of the progress, and others would suffer your fault. Also the =
statistics proved to me that it works like this the best, and any change =
would just ruin the whole idea! Instead, witht he help of the "Email =
Marketing Guide", try to reach as many people as you can, to increase =
your profit.=20
According to past experiences, if you can send out about 500 emails, =
about 25 will send your letter on. If they can do the same, they will =
have 25 buyers too. Now there's a decrease in the letters after the =
second level, so your letter won't be received by a million people - as =
others would claim, but I still hope to reach about a 10,000 people on =
the sixth level, which would mean $50,000. And even one of them would =
pay my invest back!

Now log in and download your pack from:
www.emg.inihu.com

After you downloaded and read the "Emaill marketing guide", you will =
have some ideas on how to find email addresses on the net, what tools to =
use, and how to be more efficient in your email marketing. While through =
the "Total Resell" master ebook you will get to download a huge amount =
of tools and ebooks to become an internet marketing genious. Get started =
now, and good luck!!!
