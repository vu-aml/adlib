In response to your request, attached you will find the international trade
data you purchased on October 25th, 2001 (order number 116832). I included
the data for all the available years. If there is no data for a year, for a
specific code, it's that there was no data reported. The reason why you did
not obtain the data for the years before 2001 is probably because you did
not highlight the years you wished. In fact, for each of the variables, you
have to highlight the ones you wish to obtain, even if you selected the
"individually" box. 
 
If you have questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. Thank you for
your interest in Statistics Canada.

When I purchased this data, I was under the impression there was
multiple years worth of data. The result I received was only for 2001.
Could someone explain what happened to 1993-2000 export figures?

Please contact Monika Causholli at 713-345-1510 (the purchase of this
data was for her)


Thanks,
Avril Forster
