I under calculated the MW capacity needed to meet the new renewable standard, and am reattaching the analysis.  The below table is the portion that was revised.  I used a 30% capacity factor since many of the new renewable resources coming on line are wind.  The MWs required could be inflated (i.e. cf of 50% v. 30%) in the out years if more biomass facilities are sited.

Also, unless something's changed, the obligation would be tradeable.

All -
Wanted to make you aware of a couple of bills before the CA legislature that would place a renewable purchase obligation on all retail sellers in California if enacted.  The attached document provides a comparative analysis of both bills (which are quite similar in language) and the resulting commercial implications.   One bill in particular has momentum in that is it attached to the SCE bailout.  Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara have their finger on the "pulse" on the movement of these bills, so as far as status please contact them.
