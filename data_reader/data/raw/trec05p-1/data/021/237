01-158  A Valid Employment Arbitration Agreement May Preclude Class Action Lawsuits <http://www.eeac.org/private/01-158.pdf>  EEAC's analysis reveals that there is support in the federal case law for concluding that an enforceable agreement to arbitrate employment disputes may cut off the option of bringing a class action lawsuit. 

01-157  FLSA/Wage-Hour Clearinghouse Calls <http://www.eeac.org/private/01-157.pdf>  While EEAC does not regularly track wage-hour compliance issues, we do get calls about the topic from time to time.
