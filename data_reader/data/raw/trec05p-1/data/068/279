================================== 

Who We Are

Cornerstone Research is a leading financial/economic 
consulting firm that specializes in providing attorneys 
with expert testimony and economic and financial analyses 
in all phases of commercial litigation. Our staff of more 
than ninety consultants works closely with prominent 
faculty at many top universities.  Our work includes 
developing economic and financial damages models, 
conducting market research to analyze driving forces behind
business successes and failures, and supporting experts in 
writing expert reports and preparing for trial testimony.

Cornerstone is involved in a broad variety of cases.  We 
analyze factors affecting the stock and option prices of a 
company, study the impact of regulatory changes on the 
development of an industry, determine the effects of a 
firm's activities on its competitors, and research 
historical merger and acquisition events.  Our work has 
involved highly visible events and legal issues.  Some of 
our recent cases have examined the failures of many 
Internet high-tech ventures, the collapse of the savings 
and loan industry, price fixing, insider trading, and large
corporate mergers.  Our clients come from a variety of 
industries, such as commercial and investment banks, 
consumer goods producers, and leading technology and 
telecommunications firms.

http://www.cornerstone.com/

Associates at Cornerstone

Associates are central to case work at Cornerstone.  In the
initial stages, associates actively participate in the 
formulation of the work plan and the analysis of issues.  
As the case progresses, associates handle the complex 
aspects of a case directly, while managing and advising 
analysts.  They work with senior staff, experts, and 
clients to develop case strategy and to determine how best 
to communicate our findings.  An associate's 
responsibilities include:
 Identifying key economic and financial issues
 Conducting in-depth research and analyzing relevant data
 Creating analytical frameworks, and building economic and
financial models
 Presenting complex findings to counsel
 Participating in the preparation of expert reports, 
declarations, and other work product

Company Culture

We provide friendly and cooperative working environment.  
Even with the significant growth over the last couple of 
years, we have maintained a non-hierarchical collegial 
culture.  We recruit associates with a long-term 
development perspective instead of 'up-or-out' mentality.  
Associates are encouraged to take initiatives and 
leadership roles in both case work and company business 
development.

Candidate Profile

Our current associates and managers include MBAs from 
Stanford, Chicago, Duke, Wharton, Yale, Carnegie Mellon, 
etc.  The ideal candidate should have the ability to 
develop structured case-cracking strategies and creative 
solutions, present concise explanations of complex 
analyses, and independently manage projects and junior 
staff.  Candidates should have strong background in 
finance, accounting, or economics, as well as strong 
communication and writing skills.  We offer 
industry-competitive compensation.
Interested candidates should send a cover letter which 
includes your location preference (we have offices in Menlo
Park, CA, Boston, MA, New York, NY and Washington, D.C.), 
and a resume to:
