I am not very young, I have neither wife nor children, nor a library, but,
as I said, I read the Intelligencer, which is enough for me; it is to me a
delightful paper, and so it was to my father. It is of great use, for it
contains all that a man requires to know; the names of the preachers at the

for his resting-place. The newspaper and the churchyard were always exciting
objects to me. My walks to the latter were like bathing-places to my good
humor. Every one can read the newspaper for himself, but come with me to the
churchyard while the sun shines and the trees are green, and let us wander
among the graves. Each of them is like a closed book, with the back
uppermost, on which we can read the title of what the book contains, but

own use and pleasure a history of all who lie here, and a few more beside.

to do, a horror came over her and she drove those thoughts away.
