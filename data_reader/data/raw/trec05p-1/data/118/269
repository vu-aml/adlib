hi.. i know you are under tremendous pressure.  i'd like to help in any way possible to clean things up.. if you have not already completely gone down this path, i can help with the banks and marketers up here..i know all of them.  for example, we are loking at unwinding a 12 year deal CSFB has on with us. most of the banks hold reserve against specific deals.. this can increase depending on the counter.  in the case of csfb, this is certainly the case... it can also be in our best interest to get deals off if we are paying money out to the counter.. this is the case with catequil (hedge fund) who holds 23M of our money- we are paying them Libor but borrowing at Libor + 350..
 
+ looking into all this because we can take some money.. also good to just clear up lines as this has been a major impediment to bigger deals this year.
 
+ campbell- can you give me 5 minutes to give them comfort we can clear ANYTHING they want.. 
 
market comment.. talking to pulaski today..put on the following through the floor today- strikes could be slightly different..
jan02- short 5 calls, long 3.75 calls, short 2.75 puts- 1200 lots
jun02- long 2.75 puts, short 3.75 calls- 1500 lots
 
basically playing small withdrawal scenerio in nov and dec and high end march storage.. wants to be max short summer but does not see big move till mid jan- willing to risk the 2.75 line on the jan options..
 
seems contrary to what you've been talking about.. weak front, supported back...unless you do not see weakness till jan/feb....
