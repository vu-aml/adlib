Natural Gas Futures End Friday Flat


    Natural gas futures for March delivery on the NYMEX  ended 
another boring session flat for the day last Friday at $2.138 per 
MMBtu. The April contract gained $0.008 to $2.198 per MMBtu. The 
market opened lower, but was soon boosted by short-term cold and 
short-covering from speculators and locals pushing as high as $2.165 
per MMBtu. Buy-stops were believed to be above $2.17 per MMBtu, and 
will still likely be there today. Estimated volume Friday was only 
about 50,400 contracts, with 19,600 of those spreads. There just was 
not enough volume to hit the buy-stops as the market hovered mostly 
between $2.14 – $2.15. With the market unable to breach $2.17, 
speculators were forced to back-off late. If $2.17 can be breached 
today, the market could rise to the next resistance level at $2.22, 
and then possibly as high as $2.48 before reality once again sinks 
in. However, if the cash market opens lower this morning, the market 
may not get a chance to test the resistance. With still more than 1 
Tcf in excess storage over last year and a relatively mild winter so 
far, the market's short to medium term bias is still down. Natural 
gas for weekend delivery across the US and Canada was generally flat 
to $0.10 higher Friday. Natural gas for weekend delivery at the Henry 
hub gained $0.05 to $2.19 per MMBu.

Enron Power Trading Falls in 4th Quarter

  
    Enron's 4th quarter power trading volumes were about 26% lower 
than the previous quarter, which is surprising since it was bankrupt 
for a third of the quarter and in deep trouble for over half of the 
period. Enron Power Marketing sold almost 221 million MW from October 
through December, down from about 300 million MW sold during the 3rd 
quarter. Last week, the FERC began investigating allegations that 
Enron unfairly raised wholesale power prices during California's 
power crisis last year. After Enron took a $1.2 billion write-down in 
shareholder equity related to its off-balance-sheet transactions, 
other energy firms limited their trading with Enron out of concern 
credit obligations. In the first 3 quarters of 2001, Enron had about 
15% of the nations wholesale power market and AEP was next in line 
with about an 8% share. The table below shows Enron's biggest 
customers, the total MW sold and the highest price paid by each for 
the 4th quarter.

Mirant Moving to Allay Investor Fears


    In an attempt to allay the fears of investors, Mirant plans to 
sell assets and reduce expenditures to lower its debt. Shares of 
Mirant have fallen by 50% in the last 2 months, following the 
downfall of Enron and the downgrade of about $4.9 billion of its debt 
to junk status by Moody's. Last week, Mirant said that 4th quarter 
earnings had dropped by 55%, due to lower energy prices and a charge 
of $66 million from exposure to Enron. It also cut its capital budget 
by 50% and lowered its earnings forecast in 2002 to $1.60 to $1.70 
per share, from its December estimate of  $1.90 to $2.00, because of 
lower profit margins. Mirant expects 1st quarter profits of $0.30 per 
share, lower than last year's $0.52 per share. Profit for the 4th 
quarter dipped to $30 million, or $0.09 per share, from $67 million, 
or $0.20 per share a year ago. Revenue was off 9%, to $7.24 billion 
from $7.96 billion. Mirant was spun off from Southern Company in 
September 2000 and the deal was completed last April, when Southern 
distributed 272 million shares, or 80% of Mirant for $9.44 billion. 
In efforts to distance itself from Enron, Mirant points out that 
assets, such as power plants, contributed 90% to its profitability, 
unlike Enron, whose trading unit was responsible for 90% of its 2000 
revenue. Mirant has delayed plans to spend $3 billion on tripling its 
15,000 MW of power this year. Instead it will limit capital spending 
to the completion of power plants that will produce 5,700 MW. Mirant 
will also cut about 65% of job at its German unit, Bewag, which it 
wants to sell.

Midwest ISO Begins Selling Regional Transmission Service  

    The Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator has 
implemented its tariff and will now provide regional transmission 
service for bulk power in the Midwest ISO footprint. Transmission 
customers are now able to request transmission service from Midwest 
ISO without going to individual transmission owners. The Midwest ISO, 
which serves 21 transmission owners in 15 states, is responsible for 
evaluating and coordinating requests for access to the regional power 
grid on a non-discriminatory basis. The Midwest ISO says that 
transmission customers in the Midwest will now benefit from 
standardized rates, terms and conditions for service over its 86,000 
miles of transmission lines. Transmission customers are now able to 
request transmission service from the MISO's OASIS website, giving 
them the ability to view transmission availability data at the same 
time and request transmission service in the same manner. It also 
provides for streamlined electronic scheduling which allows customers 
to easily schedule approved transactions for service across multiple 
control areas in the MISO footprint. In addition, customers will now 
have access to an independent, regional analysis of bulk power flows 
utilizing a standard methodology. The MISO will provide a single bill 
to customers for all transmission service provided.

Wisconsin Energy Power Plant Plan 

    Wisconsin Energy plans to build $3 billion in new electricity 
generators over the next nine years to meet growing energy demands. 
Forecasts indicate Wisconsin will need more than the 2,800 MW the new 
units will generate by 2011. The projects include 2 natural gas fired 
generators and 3 coal burning units at existing power plants. Other 
power producers including Calpine and Mirant have delayed new 
construction in the state because of lower electricity demand and 
prices. The first natural gas fired should be under construction by 
early next year to be in service before the summer of 2005. Wisconsin 
Energy has created a subsidiary that would build and own the 
generators and lease them back to the utility for up to 25 years. 
Calpine, Enron and PG&E had opposed the proposal, saying it would 
delay deregulation in the state by more than a decade.
