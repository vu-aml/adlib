Enron Corp. (ENE)
10Q Info Consistent With Plusses For DYN In Deal

Summary

ENE filed its 3Q'01 10Q last night with information ranging from updates on
accounting restatements, balance sheet details and discussions of off-balance
sheet obligations.

Important disclosures were made related to acceleration of debt repayment due to
recent credit rating downgrades, reduced 4Q'01 eps expectations and liquidity.

ENE has $690 million in debt due on Nov 27 because of recent downgrades. We
expect this obligation to be renegotiated, satisfied out of the current cash
position of $1.5 billion or collateralized.

A reduction in 4Q'01 eps expectations because of ENE issues and other items was
part of our recent estimate reduction from $0.48 to $0.40 for 4Q'01, (before
non-
recurring items) discussed in a report dated Nov 5, 2001. We now expect 4Q eps
to be in a $0.25-$0.35 range.

Also in the 10Q, ENE describes other items discussed in the conference call of
Nov 14 including $8 billion of "non-core" (principally international and
broadband assets) that are for sale, an ability to issue $2 billion of
additional equity before the Dynegy (DYN, 43.60, Strong Buy) deal closes and a
total debt balance of $16.3 billion ($13.0 "on balance sheet" and $3.3 billion
"off balance sheet").

The "material adverse change (MAC)" clause in the DYN/ENE deal was described as
considered if other ENE liabilities (primarily litigation) exceed $2 billion net
of insurance or reserves. If an additional $1.5 billion in liabilities is
assessed a MAC is deemed to have occurred.

In assessing a 90% probability that the DYN/ENE deal will be completed, we note
that ENE is not a going concern without it, DYN demonstrably benefits by it
(please see report dated Nov 9,'01) and Chevron/Texaco (CVX, 82.91) supports it.
In our view, positive comments by CVX yesterday, and the $1.5 billion cash
infusion to ENE from CVX on Nov 13, add to the support shown for the deal.

We continue to rate DYN Strong Buy because of its earnings and valuation upside
potential in this deal. Our current eps est for DYN of $2.55 for '02 moves to
$3.25 or higher with a completed deal. Our DYN target price of $54 is subject to
upward revision as well. For ENE, our Strong Buy rating expects that the deal
spread, currently about 30% will narrow as progress is made toward a closing.
