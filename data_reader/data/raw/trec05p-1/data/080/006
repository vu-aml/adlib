> Luigi,
>
> As to  topics, I'd suggest working on the following for the rest of
> the  year:
>
> 1)  Energy 101 (can be accomplished by taking either of the MGMT 669
> sections --  the Thursday night section will be more lecture based,
> the Tuesday  night section will have less lecture but more guest
> speakers and student  presentations)
> 2)  Energy Consulting
> 3)   Financial Services (trading, risk management)
> 4)  Origination, Marketing and Sales (Oil, Gas, Electricity)
> 5)  Project Development, strategic planning
> 6)  Structuring of Products
> 7)  Supply Chain
> 8)  Venture Capital within energy industry
> 9)  Geo-Political considerations
>
> You are  on the right track getting companies involved. Typical
> groupings would  be:
> 1)  Utilities (e.g. Reliant)
> 2) Gas,  Pipeline, & Trading (e.g. Enron, El Paso Energy)
> 3) Oil  Products (retail arm of Shell, Exxon, etc.)
> 4)  Exploration & Production (Shell, Exxon, Apache, etc.)
> 5)  Chemicals (majors like Shell, Exxon, but also Lyondell, Du Pont,
> etc.)
> 6)  Oilfield services (Halliburton, Schlumberger, Core Lab, BJ
> Services,  Weatherford, etc.)

> Dear John, dear  Vincent,
>
> Let me up-date  you on the roundtables we decided in the last meeting
> to focus on during the  rest of the academic year.  The  original idea
> was to keep the number of events from 3 to 4 roundtables each
> semester.  The result of the last  meeting with all members was driven
> by enthusiasm, and as you see below we  produced a prolific list of 13
> subjects.   Maybe you can help us to narrow down to a reasonable
> number, 12 events  (one we had yesterday) by May 2002 we think are too
> many.
>
> I also would take  this opportunity to update on the ongoing
> relationships with the most  prominent industry in the sectors and
> have your feedback, suggestion on how to  group them in the
> roundtable.
> We got great  support so far from Reliant, Enron, Mirant, Schell
> (Coral), Bp, Duke.   El Paso, Chevron-Texaco,  Phillips, and
> Halliburton etc.. also are interested and we will present the  club to
> them as well.  The major  challenge for us is not transform the Energy
> Club in a Finance Energy  Club.  At Rice we already have a  Finance
> club and it works very well.   We want first educate about the energy
> industry in general, and second  present the opportunities for MBAs in
> the industry in different areas,  including finance but not limited
> to.
>
> Topics  of Roundtable Meetings:
>
> 0)  Energy "101"
> 1)  Corporate Finance (Treasurer or Controller)
> 2)  Energy Consulting
> 3)  Financial Services (trading, risk management)
> 4)  Origination, Marketing and Sales (Oil, Gas, Electricity) -
> Marteen
> 5)  Project Development, strategic planning
> 6)  Project Finance
> 7)  Project Risk Management
> 8)  Regulation, Deregulation, and Restructuring - Reliant done
> 9/17/2001
> 9)  Structuring of Products
> 10)  Supply Chain
> 11)  Telecom - Broadband
> 12)  Venture Capital within energy industry - Brian, Paresh
>
> Thanks  in advance for your precious suggestions and I am looking
> forward to meeting  you.
