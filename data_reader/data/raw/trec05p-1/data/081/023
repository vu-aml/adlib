Don:

This sounds like to same offering that we previously received about two weeks ago from Michael Kolman (not our Michael Coleman) of Navigant. Was the offering you received from Navigant as well?

FYI, Navigant (again, Michael Kolman) is representing us on the sale of our SW501D5A, and we have frequent updates with him on our turbine as well as other turbines and sites being offered in the market.

Regards,

Ben
