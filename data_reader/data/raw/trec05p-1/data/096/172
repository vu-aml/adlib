The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.  In case you access email ahead of voice mail Janet, the guy is Chistopher Sullivan, Rocky Mountain Helium, 1-800-945-1547.  Thanks all.  DF
