   Word of the Day for Wednesday April 10, 2002:

   pellucid \puh-LOO-sid\, adjective:
   1. Transparent; clear; not opaque.
   2. Easily understandable.

     The   prevailing   atmosphere   as   one  cruises  Kukulcan
     Boulevard, the busy strip where most of Cancun's 122 hotels
     are  clustered,  remains  that of an Orlando or a Las Vegas
     dropped intact next to pellucid Caribbean waters.
     --Larry  Rohter,  "What's  Doing  in  Cancun."  [1]New York
     Times, March 8, 1998

     In  her  scrupulous  and  pellucid  prose,  she  appears to
     distance herself from the optimistic Californian light.
     --Cynthia Ozick, "What Writer's Writers Write." [2]New York
     Times Magazine, January 2, 2000
     _________________________________________________________

   Pellucid  comes from Latin pellucidus, "shining, transparent,"
   from  pellucere,  "to  shine  through," from per-, "through" +
   lucere, "to shine."
