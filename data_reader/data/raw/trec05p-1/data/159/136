I just got a call from Li Sun.  She is expecting to get her H-1 visa anytime, and wants to make sure that she receives it.  Should we have her contact Tindall & Foster directly?  Also, by law, when an individual on an H-1b visa is terminated, the company is required to provide them a one way ticket back to their home country.  Does that still apply in a bankruptcy?  If so, who will be handling those arrangements?
