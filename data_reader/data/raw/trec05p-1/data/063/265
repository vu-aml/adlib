Three guys, a Canadian, Osama bin Ladin and
  Uncle Sam are out walking together one day.
  They come across a lantern and a Genie pops out
  of it.

  "I will give each of you each one wish, that's three
  wishes total," says the Genie.

  The Canadian says, "I am a farmer, my dad was a
  farmer, and my son will also farm. I want the land to
  be forever fertile in Canada."

  With a blink of the Genie's eye, 'POOF' the land in Canada was
  forever made fertile for farming.


  Osama bin Ladin was amazed, so he said, "I want a wall around
  Afganistan, so that no infidels, Jews or Americans can come into our
  precious state."

  Again, with a blink of the Genie's eye, 'POOF' there was a huge wall
  around Afganistan.


  "Uncle Sam" (A former civil engineer), asks,
  "I'm very curious. Please tell me more about this wall."
  The Genie explains, "Well, it's about 15,000 feet high,
  500 feet thick and completely surrounds the country;
  nothing can get in or out---virtually impenetrable."

  "UncleSam" says, "Fill it with water."
