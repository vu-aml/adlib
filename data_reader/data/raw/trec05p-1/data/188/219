At the request of Lance Schuler, I am attaching the most recent version of the draft Transition Services Agreement for the Template and Wind transactions.  This draft does not yet include a description of the IT consulting services that the estate will need from Netco, but I am expecting to get some input on this from Greg Piper today.  Please call if you have any questions.
