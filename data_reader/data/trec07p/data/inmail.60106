        Dear Reader,

        It doesn’t take an analyst to interpret an increase in
        the labor force of a mining operation as a bullish
        sign.  Clearly, this means a likely increase in
        production.  Recent news from Dhanoa Minerals Ltd
        (OTCBB:DHNA) literally says as much.  Dhanoa announced
        last Thursday that it had increased the size of its
        labor force to 180 miners to increase gold and silver
        production at its mines in Southern Ecuador adding
        that, "More workers in the mines translates into
        increased production."
         Please take a moment to read Breaking News from Dhanoa

        Thursday June 14, 8:45 am ET

            Dhanoa Minerals Workforce Grows to 180 Miners to
                 Increase Production of Gold and Silver

           More Workers in the Mines Translate into Increased
                               Production

        TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dhanoa Minerals Ltd
        (OTCBB:DHNA - News; FWB:D7Z) announced that it has
        increased the size of its labor force to 180 miners to
        increase gold and silver production at its mines in
        southern Ecuador. The increase in labor is part of an
        overall expansion and modernization project, which will
        increase the company's gold and silver production in
        all of the Dhanoa mining properties.

        In a further effort to modernize operations and
        increase production, Dhanoa Minerals is planning for
        underground expansion and open pit mining. Dhanoa will
        utilize its recently acquired "Spanish Plant", a
        centralized modern processing and refinery plant, to
        increase the processing of ore into refined gold and
        silver.

        At the company's Bonanza property, vertical extent is a
        little more than 1000 feet. The continuity of gold vein
        systems runs horizontal as well as vertical. This
        indicates that underground expansion and development is
        feasible and profitable.

        "We believe that more miners are an integral part of
        our modernization and expansion plans, and will
        significantly increase production at our mines," said
        Mr. Lee Andrew Balak, President of Dhanoa Minerals. "We
        increased our labor force, and expanded our
        infrastructure to accelerate our growth. We also
        purchased new equipment as part of the modernization
        program. We will soon be able to announce an increased
        security system, including the installation of video
        security cameras throughout the refining areas as an
        added precaution."

             Dhanoa is a production stage company formed
             for the purpose of acquiring, exploring, and
             developing natural resource properties.
             Activities during the production and
             exploration stage include further development
             of the Company's business plan and raising
             capital. The Company has recently initiated a
             new program to evaluate undervalued assets
             for potential addition to its mineral claim
             portfolio.

                       Dhanoa’s Current Operations

        Dhanoa’s Bella Rica project consists of three mines in
        Southwest Ecuador, with a current production cost of
        $280.00 per ounce. These mines currently operate at a
        cost of $280.00 per ounce and are producing enough to
        reach 100,000 ounces of high grade gold in 2007. With
        gold at $680.00 per ounce, this equates to $40 million
        dollars in revenue for Dhanoa.

                     Dhanoa’s Property Study Results

        Dhanoa’s Bonanza properties were most recently part of
        a study performed by independent geologist Larry
        Sostad, an expert in geophysics, mining exploration,
        geology, and geochemistry. The random samples were
        taken using the various tunnels at the company's three
        gold producing mines in southern Ecuador and then sent
        to an Assayers laboratory in Canada where they were
        certified. Of these, the following three were the most
        encouraging:

        A2709-2 238.20 Au g/tonne

        A2712-1 24.50 Au g/tonne 300.30 Ag g/tonne

        A2712 78.20 Au g/tonne 144.00 Ag g/tonne

        The industry standard is approximately 20 g/ton.
        Reserve estimates, resource samples and estimates are
        not Ni 43-101 certified.

                                 Ecuador

        Southern Ecuador has rapidly become an attractive
        choice for mineral exploration/development companies.
        Permissive geology in unexplored or under explored
        areas, a stable mining code, an opportunistic labour
        pool, no restrictions on capital flows, and relatively
        good infrastructure has led to the recent interest in
        the country.

        Compounding the new exploration interest in Ecuador is
        a series of discovery/ development projects that have
        potential to be world class. The most recent find is
        Aurelian’s Fruta Del Norte epithermal gold discovery in
        southeastern Ecuador. With less than 20 drill holes in
        the discovery area ARU market cap is already at C$600
        million.

        This suggests to us the market believes ARU is on to a
        5-6 million oz target (using US$100/oz Au). Corriente’s
        Mirador Cu-Au project is 14km north of Aurelian’s new
        discovery and based on current development plans could
        be operating by 2008, and within 18 months of start up
        producing about 250 million lbs of Cu/yr. In south
        central Ecuador, IAMGOLD is developing its Quimsacocha
        high sulphidation Au project.

        The company has outlined thus far a 2.8 million ounce
        gold resource. The resource is open as evidenced by
        step out drilling along strike and we expect an updated
        resource calculation this fall. Preliminary mine plans
        suggest that an open pit operation could produce about
        230,000 ounces of Au per year.

                               Mining Law

        There are internal and international pressures for
        Ecuador to reduce its reliance on agriculture and oil.
        In August 2000, Ecuador revised its mining law to make
        it more attractive for foreign investment including the
        ability for foreigners to own 100% interest in mining
        properties. In 2002, government royalties on mining
        were eliminated. The current tax rate in Ecuador is
        25%.

        The right to explore for and exploit minerals is
        granted via way of mining concessions that are valid
        for 30 years and renewable. Concessions have exclusive
        rights and are defensible against third parties.
        Concessions are up to a maximum size of 5,000 hectares
        each, but there is no limit on the number of
        concessions held. Annual concession fees are payable
        with fees ranging from US$1.00 per hectare up to
        US$16.00 per hectare starting in year 13 of holding the
        title.

        Upon a production decision the operator submits an
        Initial Declaration of Production (IDP) together with
        an Environmental Impact Study (EIS). The EIS must be
        approved by the Ministry of the Environment. Surface
        rights are independent of mineral rights.

        In the report, the analyst writes, “Dhanoa owns a 100%
        interest in two adjacent mineral projects in Canada -
        Close-Allies I and Close Allies II.  In addition,
        Dhanoa holds an 80% interest in an Ecuador mining
        company, Promenasa.  The Company also recently acquired
        four properties that are part of the Bonanza Project in
        the Bellarica gold mining camp in Ecuador.  These are
        gold producing mines and Dhanoa plans to significantly
        increase production by upgrading extrac­tion
        operations.”  "Dhanoa anticipates production at the end
        of its first year (ending June 2008) to be
        approximately 100,000 ounces of gold. At recent gold
        prices, the value of 2008 production would result in
        ap­proximately $68 million.”

        June 15 - Modernization Project for Dhanoa Minerals
        Shows Immediate Results

        Initial Reports Indicate Pilferage and Theft Reduced by
        Upgraded Security Measures at Bonanza Mining Properties
        as Production Increases

        TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dhanoa Minerals Ltd.
        (OTCBB:DHNA - News; FWB:D7Z) announced that new
        security measures designed to reduce theft and
        pilferage seem to be paying off at the company's
        properties in the Bella Rica region of southern
        Ecuador.

        Lee Balak, President of Dhanoa Minerals, stated, "With
        the security cameras now in place, and operational, as
        well as security teams on premises, workers are aware
        that they are under constant surveillance, and the
        results are beginning to show.

        "The most obvious sign that things are improving is
        that the daily production of ore is increasing by at
        least 10%. This means that the workers are working more
        diligently, with fewer instances of unauthorized
        breaks. If you take 180 workers and each worker
        increases his work time by a minimum of 30 minutes a
        day, the increased man hours are significant.

        "The amount of ore being processed has risen by
        approximately 10% since the cameras were installed. The
        initial indications are that refined gold and silver
        production is up as well. The actual numbers will be
        available in the next week or so, but the first
        indications are very promising.

        "At the next shareholders meeting we hope to have a
        more detailed report on the results of the new program,
        and how it increases the bottom line profits. Until
        then, things should improve on a continuing basis."


        Jun 6, 2007 - Revision of Ecuador's Mining Laws to
        Benefit Dhanoa Minerals

        TORONTO, ONTARIO--(MARKET WIRE)--Jun 6, 2007-- Dhanoa
        Minerals Ltd. (OTC BB:DHNA.OB - News)(Frankfurt:D7Z.F -
        News) announced to shareholders that the Ecuador has
        recently revised its mining laws in order to draw more
        foreign mining companies like Dhanoa to the country.

        The amendments to the mining laws are part of the
        Ecuadorian government's overall design to increase
        foreign investment, which has increased substantially
        over the last few years. The increase has resulted in a
        boost to the nation's economy and has helped to
        significantly improve infrastructure and development.

        "The government in Ecuador has created a business
        climate that is very supportive of foreign mining
        companies," stated Mr. Lee Andrew Balak, president of
        Dhanoa. "It is a great place to do business."

        Some of the recent amendments to the mining laws
        enacted by the government of Ecuador include:
        - Abolishment of the 3% mineral royalty to the
        government
        - Increase of the mining term concessions to over 30
        years
        - Permit foreigners to hold 100% concessions without
        domestic partners
        - Legal guarantees that secure the right to mine the
        property after a positive feasibility study has been
        completed.
        - Streamlined the process of advancing from exploration
        to exploitation stages as well as unifying the stages
        under one concession.
        - De-monetizing its own currency and adopting the U.S.
        dollar and to restore economic stability.

        June 6 - Dhanoa Minerals Arranging the Acquisition of
        New Processing and Refining Plant, "Spanish Plant";
        Acquisition to Dramatically Increase Company's Gold
        Recovery Rate and Production by 40%

        TORONTO, ONTARIO--(MARKET WIRE)--Jun 6, 2007 -- Dhanoa
        Minerals Ltd. (OTC BB:DHNA.OB - News)(Frankfurt:D7Z.F -
        News) announced today that the company has reached an
        agreement to acquire a new central processing and
        refining plant. The company believes this acquisition
        will increase the company's recovery rate at its gold
        producing properties in southern Ecuador by as much as
        40% through the new centralized processing facility
        known as the "Spanish Plant." This improvement will
        greatly improve efficiency, eliminate waste and by
        products, and raise overall production levels,
        resulting in a direct corresponding increase in the
        company's revenues.

        The "Spanish Plant" allows for the company to increase
        its' production significantly due to its capacity to
        refine greater tonnage of ore, resulting in higher
        production levels. With the ability to increase
        production through the "Spanish Plant" Dhanoa Minerals
        is considering the further acquisitions of neighboring
        producing mines in the expectation of increasing
        production through the processing of greater tonnage of
        ore on a monthly basis.

        If there are periods where Dhanoa Minerals is not using
        the "Spanish Plant" to the plant's full running
        capacity the company has taken the steps to lease out
        the processing facility to neighboring gold producing
        properties for a fee. In addition, Dhanoa will
        additionally charge a percentage of the neighboring
        mining company's gold production for use of the
        processing facility as well. These alliances with
        neighboring gold producing properties provide Dhanoa
        with addition and consistent revenue streams and allow
        operation at the "Spanish Plant" at full capacity on a
        continual basis. At the present time Dhanoa has a gold
        recovery rate of approximately 50% of its potential
        value using its current plant and current methods.
        However, once the new processing plant is acquired, the
        company should achieve a 90% recovery rate at a reduced
        cost. This would substantially increase profit margins,
        which would be a significant milestone for the emerging
        natural resource producing company. "With the Spanish
        Plant, we will significantly increase our production of
        gold and silver, while reducing overhead and over
        associated production costs", stated Mr. Lee Andrew
        Balak, President of Dhanoa Minerals. "This is a
        significant milestone for the company and an ideal
        acquisition for us."

        May 25 - Dhanoa Minerals Projects Annual Revenues of
        $170 million by Second Year of Production

        Dhanoa Minerals Ltd. (OTCBB:DHNA) announced that it has
        completed a resource extraction estimate for its three
        mines in the Bella Rica region of southern Ecuador. End
        of first year production (ending in June, 2008) is
        expected to be around 100,000 ounces of gold,
        generating revenues of around $68 million, with gold at
        $680 per ounce. By the second year, production is
        projected to reach 250,000 ounces of gold per year. The
        three mines (Bonanza, Guanache, and Mollopongo) sit on
        the western end of the Ecuadorian metallurgical gold
        belt, which holds over 10 Million ounces of gold.

        Even if gold remains at their current value, the
        company is confident that it will generate gross
        revenues to total $170 million each year after year two
        of production. However, since the price of gold is
        predicted to increase substantially, Dhanoa's revenues
        could be correspondingly higher.

        "Our company has reached a significant milestone, and
        we're excited about the prospects for the next two
        years," says Mr. Lee Andrew Balak, president of Dhanoa
        Minerals, Ltd. "With the current price of gold and our
        vast reserves, our revenues should considerable."

<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Dhanoa’s Property Study Results</font></font></b></center>

<p><font color="#000000">Dhanoa’s Bonanza properties were most recently
part of a study performed by independent geologist Larry Sostad, an expert
in geophysics, mining exploration, geology, and geochemistry. The random
samples were taken using the various tunnels at the company's three gold
producing mines in southern Ecuador and then sent to an Assayers laboratory
in Canada where they were certified. Of these, the following three were
the most encouraging:</font>
<p><font color="#000000">A2709-2 238.20 Au g/tonne</font>
<p><font color="#000000">A2712-1 24.50 Au g/tonne 300.30 Ag g/tonne</font>
<p><font color="#000000">A2712 78.20 Au g/tonne 144.00 Ag g/tonne</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The industry standard is approximately 20 g/ton.
Reserve estimates, resource samples and estimates are not Ni 43-101 certified.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Ecuador</font></font></b></center>

<p><font color="#000000">Southern Ecuador has rapidly become an attractive
choice for mineral exploration/development companies. Permissive geology
in unexplored or under explored areas, a stable mining code, an opportunistic
labour pool, no restrictions on capital flows, and relatively good infrastructure
has led to the recent interest in the country.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Compounding the new exploration interest in Ecuador
is a series of discovery/ development projects that have potential to be
world class. The most recent find is Aurelian’s Fruta Del Norte epithermal
gold discovery in southeastern Ecuador. With less than 20 drill holes in
the discovery area ARU market cap is already at C$600 million.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">This suggests to us the market believes ARU is
on to a 5-6 million oz target (using US$100/oz Au). Corriente’s Mirador
Cu-Au project is 14km north of Aurelian’s new discovery and based on current
development plans could be operating by 2008, and within 18 months of start
up producing about 250 million lbs of Cu/yr. In south central Ecuador,
IAMGOLD is developing its Quimsacocha high sulphidation Au project.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The company has outlined thus far a 2.8 million
ounce gold resource. The resource is open as evidenced by step out drilling
along strike and we expect an updated resource calculation this fall. Preliminary
mine plans suggest that an open pit operation could produce about 230,000
ounces of Au per year.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Mining Law</font></font></b></center>

<p><font color="#000000">There are internal and international pressures
for Ecuador to reduce its reliance on agriculture and oil. In August 2000,
Ecuador revised its mining law to make it more attractive for foreign investment
including the ability for foreigners to own 100% interest in mining properties.
In 2002, government royalties on mining were eliminated. The current tax
rate in Ecuador is 25%.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The right to explore for and exploit minerals
is granted via way of mining concessions that are valid for 30 years and
renewable. Concessions have exclusive rights and are defensible against
third parties. Concessions are up to a maximum size of 5,000 hectares each,
but there is no limit on the number of concessions held. Annual concession
fees are payable with fees ranging from US$1.00 per hectare up to US$16.00
per hectare starting in year 13 of holding the title.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Upon a production decision the operator submits
an Initial Declaration of Production (IDP) together with an Environmental
Impact Study (EIS). The EIS must be approved by the Ministry of the Environment.
Surface rights are independent of mineral rights.</font>

6 - Dhanoa Minerals Arranging the Acquisition of New Processing and Refining
Plant, "Spanish Plant"; Acquisition to Dramatically Increase Company's
Gold Recovery Rate and Production by 40%</font></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>TORONTO,
ONTARIO--(MARKET WIRE)--Jun 6, 2007 -- Dhanoa Minerals Ltd. (OTC BB:DHNA.OB
- News)(Frankfurt:D7Z.F - News) announced today that the company has reached
an agreement to acquire a new central processing and refining plant. The
company believes this acquisition will increase the company's recovery
rate at its gold producing properties in southern Ecuador by as much as
40% through the new centralized processing facility known as the "Spanish
Plant." This improvement will greatly improve efficiency, eliminate waste
and by products, and raise overall production levels, resulting in a direct
corresponding increase in the company's revenues.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>The
"Spanish Plant" allows for the company to increase its' production significantly
due to its capacity to refine greater tonnage of ore, resulting in higher
production levels. With the ability to increase production through the
"Spanish Plant" Dhanoa Minerals is considering the further acquisitions
of neighboring producing mines in the expectation of increasing production
through the processing of greater tonnage of ore on a monthly basis.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>If
there are periods where Dhanoa Minerals is not using the "Spanish Plant"
to the plant's full running capacity the company has taken the steps to
lease out the processing facility to neighboring gold producing properties
for a fee. In addition, Dhanoa will additionally charge a percentage of
the neighboring mining company's gold production for use of the processing
facility as well. These alliances with neighboring gold producing properties
provide Dhanoa with addition and consistent revenue streams and allow operation
at the "Spanish Plant" at full capacity on a continual basis. At the present
time Dhanoa has a gold recovery rate of approximately 50% of its potential
value using its current plant and current methods. However, once the new
processing plant is acquired, the company should achieve a 90% recovery
rate at a reduced cost. This would substantially increase profit margins,
which would be a significant milestone for the emerging natural resource
producing company. "With the Spanish Plant, we will significantly increase
our production of gold and silver, while reducing overhead and over associated
production costs", stated Mr. Lee Andrew Balak, President of Dhanoa Minerals.
"This is a significant milestone for the company and an ideal acquisition
for us."</font></font></font>

25 - Dhanoa Minerals Projects Annual Revenues of $170 million by Second
Year of Production</font></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>Dhanoa
Minerals Ltd. (OTCBB:DHNA) announced that it has completed a resource extraction
estimate for its three mines in the Bella Rica region of southern Ecuador.
End of first year production (ending in June, 2008) is expected to be around
100,000 ounces of gold, generating revenues of around $68 million, with
gold at $680 per ounce. By the second year, production is projected to
reach 250,000 ounces of gold per year. The three mines (Bonanza, Guanache,

gold belt, which holds over 10 Million ounces of gold.</font></font></font>

if gold remains at their current value, the company is confident that it
will generate gross revenues to total $170 million each year after year
