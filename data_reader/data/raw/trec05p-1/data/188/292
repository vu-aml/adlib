Attached is a revised scope which basically includes the majority of the expansion volume to Phoenix.  Only 30 MMcf/d goes west of Station #2 while 500 MMcf/d goes to Phoenix.  The cost numbers shown in the spreadsheet are Planning's order of magnitude numbers only and do not reflect in any way what Engineering will provide.  THIS IS A REQUEST for Engineering to provide details cost for the attached scope.  Once completed, please forward to me to be presented to Asset Management (Kevin Hyatt).
