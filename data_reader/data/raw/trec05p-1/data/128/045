 Paul Harvey Writes:

  " We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that we made them
worse.

For my grandchildren, I'd like better. I'd really like for them to know
about hand me down clothes and homemade ice cream and leftover meat loaf
sandwiches.  I really would.

I hope you learn humility by being humiliated, and that you learn honesty by
being cheated.  I hope you learn to make your own bed and mow the lawn and
wash the car.  And I really hope nobody gives you a brand new car when you
are sixteen.

It will be good if at least one time you can see puppies born and your old
dog put to sleep. I hope you get a black eye fighting for something you
believe in.

I hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger brother.  And it's all
right if you have to draw a line down the middle of the room, but when he
wants to crawl under the covers with you because he's scared, I hope you let
him.  When you want to see a movie and your little brother wants to tag
along, I hope you'll let him.

I hope you have to walk uphill to school with your friends and that you live
in a town where you can do it safely.  On rainy days when you have to catch
a ride, I hope you don't ask your driver to drop you two blocks away so you
won't be seen riding with someone as uncool as your Mom.

If you want a slingshot, I hope your Dad teaches you how to make one instead
of buying one.  I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read books.

When you learn to use computers, I hope you also learn to add and subtract
in your head.  I hope you get teased by your friends when you have your
first crush on a guy/girl, and when you talk back to your mother that you
learn what ivory soap tastes like.

May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn your hand on a stove and
stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole.  I don't care if  you try a beer
once, but I hope you don't like it.  And if a friend offers you dope or a
joint, I hope you realize he is not your friend.

I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandpa and go fishing
with your Uncle.

May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during the holidays.  I hope your
mother punishes you when you throw a baseball through your neighbor's
window, and that she hugs you and kisses you at Christmas time when you give
her a plaster mold of your hand.

These things I wish for you - tough times and disappointment, hard work and
happiness. To me, it's the only way to appreciate life.

Written with a pen.  Sealed with a kiss.  I'm here for you.  And if I die
before you do, I'll go to heaven and wait for you.

Send this to all of your friends. We secure our friends, not by accepting
favors, but by doing them.

Paul Harvey RIDDLE: When asked this riddle, 80% of kindergarten kids got the
answer, compared to 17% of Stanford University seniors.

What is greater than God, More evil than the devil, The poor have it, The
rich need it, And if you eat it, you'll die?

Send this to 10 people and then press shift and you will get the answer.

P.S. You won't believe this, but this really does give you the answer!!!!

God Bless and Angel Hugs....... "
