ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

Summary of January 27, 2002

======================================

Dear Folks -

   This on-line newsletter offering previews and summaries of the
Ordinary Life gathering now goes to almost 800 people all over the
United States and in at least three foreign countries that I know of. I
am both delighted and stunned that my rantings are useful to so many.

   Of course, I hope what I have to teach has universal applicability
even though it is spoken to a group of 100 to 120 folks in Houston each
week. Sometimes things are more meaningful to the local gathering. That
may be the case for what happened this past Sunday. Then, again, maybe
not. Read on –

   Richard Wingfield put together a moving and informative video about
work that the Ordinary Life gathering has had a stake in for some years
now. We have sent both people and money to our "sister" church in
Cochabamba, Bolivia. I want to quote at length from a letter sent to
the Ordinary Life gathering by Wilson Boots. He was on the video shown
Sunday.

   "I trust that you have had opportunity to see the video record
filmed by Richard Wingfield of the dedication of the health clinic at
Emmanuel Methodist in Cochabamba, Bolivia. It was a wonderful day,
filled with hope for the host of church and community people who
gathered to celebrate this special moment. With much gratitude we
expressed heartfelt thanks for the vision and commitment of the
Ordinary Life Class that through your special offing made possible the
construction of this community health center. It's location adjacent to
the back wall of our small church sanctuary symbolizes in a special way
the profound Gospel dimensions of the healing and health that are
shared here daily in the lives of very poor people of the community.

   "It will be of interest to you to know that the small room where
Rev. Diane Wimberley is living during her year of service with Emmanuel
is just thirty feet away from this modest clinic. Diane is involved
daily in ministry with the dedicated community M.D. and nurse who
provide such excellent care for so many children, women and men who
have no other possibilities for medical care due to their situation of
poverty and absence of other health care alternatives.

   "This is a time of serious crisis, however, for this medical
outreach ministry. Due to the general economic crisis in Bolivia, and
the ending of financial support for the Doctor and nurse due to the
unusual circumstances of the international organization that has been
giving support, the work of this medical outpost has been seriously
curtailed. In fact, if minimal monthly funding cannot be made available
for at least a few months until some alternative grant can be secured,
it is the real possibility that the clinic will be closed.

   "I want to ask your consideration for the possibility of some
immediate support of this urgent need."

   Diane Wimberley sent a letter to Richard Wingfield in which she also
explains the situation. I cites parts of it:

   "One of the things that I am writing about is a need for money. The
center is in bad shape. The doc is having to cut his hours back in
order to take another job - a situation caused both by the situation
here and his practice not pulling in what it should due to the economic
crisis in the country.

   "He is a rare one who is deeply committed to this center and
everything that it stands for. He recruits other doc's in the city to
volunteer, works on soliciting other clients. He basically has told me
that his life was changed by the center when he began and nothing can
make him leave it now. So he will work three jobs: for the government
which he hates, for the university, in his private practice and come
here 2 hours in the middle of the day. He is completely committed to
helping children and their families. "

   Diane states that up until this crisis he was being paid $250 a
month by the center. That is the amount she is asking for from Ordinary
Life.

   I have gotten both calls and e-mails from folks after last Sunday
indicating that people are more than willing to see us do this - or
perhaps even more. We didn't have time to discuss this Sunday but I
wanted you to have this information and we'll talk about it when we
gather this week.

   Thanks again to Richard Wingfield for doing such an outstanding job
bringing us the story.

Much love,

Bill Kerley
