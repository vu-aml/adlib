I have a profiling amount in an excess of US$100.5M, which I seek 
your Partnership in accommodating for me. You will be rewarded 
with 4% of The total sum for your partnership. Can you be my partner 
on this? INTRODUCTION OF MY SELF As a personal consultant to him, 
authority Was handed over to me in transfer of money of an
American oil merchant For his last oil deal with my boss Mikhail 
Khodorkovsky.

Already the funds have left the shore of Russia to an European private 
Bank where the final crediting is expected to be carried out. While I 
was on the process, My Boss got arrested for his Involvement 
in politics by financing the leading And opposing political parties
 (the Union of Right Forces,Led by Boris Nemtsov, and Yabloko, a 
liberal/social democratic party Led by Gregor Yavlinsky) which
 poses a treat to President Vladimir Putin Second Tenure as Russian
