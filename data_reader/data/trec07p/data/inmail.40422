It's likely simpler to start all context refcounts equally with 1. This would 
probably reduce the current special refcount handling. But it would need some 
changes, which is easily greppable I presume.

Think of (closure) contexts, which were created in "eval"-ed code. When the 
outer context ceases to exist, the inner context can be collected. All other 
closure context is of course persistent.
