Mr. Hayslett:

Travis McCullough asked me to track down the Cross Receipt which was returned to him, possibly today.  Do you recall what floor it was directed to?  This probably sounds like a stupid question, but Travis has been working out of several offices here, on both 8 and 38, and he is in New York now.  I just want to be sure we do not lose the Cross Receipt.

Thank you.
