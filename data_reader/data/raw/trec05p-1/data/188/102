Shelley,

Things are going well.  We have had a few insidents, but she is finally learning who is boss.  Please straighten out my Lufthansa flight for Wednesday and confirm I'm wait-listed on Thursday, just in case.  I think it will be too difficult to try to take another airline, other than Luftansa/United.  If it comes to that, I'll just pay at the airline counter for a new flight (KLM or Air France).  You just confirm the present ticket.

Please respond to this email as a back-up, but I'll try and talk to you by phone prior to me heading to the Lufthansa office.

By the way, it was really nice being with you in Moscow.  I appreciate you more and more every day.  I keep telling myself that Moscow is a piece of cake compared to your ordeal in Taraz/Almaty.

Take care of your health issues.  I can't wait to see you and Chad.

Love Kim
