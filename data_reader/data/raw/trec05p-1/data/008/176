Michael, you may have already sent this.  It looks fine to me with one slight caveat.  Does this imply that we have already sent the letters notifying customers of our intent to produce copies of the contracts?  We have not yet.  Also, in a few instances we have to get a written waiver from the customer--notice will not be enough.

Subject:	RE: Status of EES Response to AG Subpoenas

Here is a suggested draft of a response to the deputy AG's letter. We plan
to send it tomorrow afternoon after we receive your comments.

Paul E. Stein, Deputy Attorney General
State of California
Office of the Attorney General
455 Golden Gate Avenue, Suite 11000
San Francisco, CA  94102
Dear Mr. Stein:
This responds to your letter of July 13, 2001, which I received on July 16,
regarding your discussions with Mike Kirby and me on behalf of Enron Energy
Services (EES).  This will confirm that you agreed that our discussions with
the Office of the Attorney General on the subject of its subpoenas served
upon EES are without prejudice to, and will not waive, any rights by EES to
object to either this investigation or the subpoenas in any subsequent
action or proceeding.  Your letter of July 13, 2001, notes some, but by no
means all, of EES's objections to the subpoenas.  Without attempting to
catalogue these objections, the following points in your July 13 letter
merit mention:
*	Confidentiality order:  This confirms we will provide you with a
suitable alternative confidentiality order for your review this week.
*	Customer notification:  EES has been, and continues to be in the
process of, providing appropriate notice to all commercial customers
(without regard for any other definition) in California with regard to your
request for their contracts.  We do not agree that our duty, if any, to
resist production under the terms of these contracts has been discharged.
*	Territoriality:  Our objections to your requests for out of state
documents and the testimony by out of state residents arises under
California statutes, common law, and California and the Constitution of the
United States.
*	Document repository:  We do not believe the Attorney General is
entitled to production of any documents other than at a central location.
*	Production:  Without waiving any of our objections to either the
Attorney General's investigation or the subpoena, EES is prepared to produce
documents which reside within California which are unambiguously called for
by the subpoena served on June 27, 2001, on the condition that we reach a
mutually acceptable confidentiality order to govern their production.
Assuming a mutually agreeable protective order, we are ready to begin doing
so on or about July 30.
Thank you for your courtesies in these matters.
Sincerely,
Michael E. Molland
