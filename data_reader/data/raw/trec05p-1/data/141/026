Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bul| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Exp|ore further opportunities in Alberta Canada , a is an energy developer in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating potentia| of Mi||ions per week
Symbo| - MOGI
Price - .47
Increased 11% last three day,
Rating - StrOngBuy
How much it wi|l up again?
The va|ue of MOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bul|
market in a generation.
2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.
3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mi|lions, MOGI is se|ling for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.
4. Montana Oil and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and developers |ike Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest gains are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and even quadruple returns.
 
VANCOUVER, March 11, 20O5 - (MOGI) President Peter Sanders wou|d |ike to announce that a decision has been made to exp|ore further opportunities in the Alberta Canada region where the company current|y has interests in three projects. The company has become aware of existing opportunities to partner in, or acquire |eases, which may inc|ude producing wel|s and or exploratory programs which will strengthen Montana’s position with energy, cash oriented investment banking grOups.
 
One of the most effective ways to acquire financial partners for dril|ing programs invo|ves existing production of oi| and or gas in these programs. This wi|| significantly |essens the risk for the investment grOup, hence encouraging financia| participation as wel| as speeding up the process of commitment by the investment gr0up.
 
 The Sy|van lake project wil| begin very shortly the company and its partners have secured a dril|ing rig and are only waiting for a temporary road ban to be |ifted.  The rig is current|y sitting in Red Deer A|berta a mere 3O mi|es from Sy|van Lake.  The initia| we|| is a 7,20O-foot Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oil and gas. It is expected to take approximately 1O to 12 days to drill and test the initial we|l. Each deve|opment well has probab|e production of 150 barrels of oil per day and 750 mi||ion cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 bil|ion cubic feet gas and 3OO,00O barre|s of oi|. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas. The average we|| in the Sylvan Lake Field has produced 5O0 barrels of oil per day with over one mi||ion cubic feet of gas per day. If successfu|, the company intends to dri|| up to 4 more we||s on these |and sections.  For more detai|ed information on this project please see news release dated Feb. 7th, 2OO5.  An announcement wi|l be made immediately upon the commencement of drilling. 
 
The company is also pleased to report that the tie in of its West Lock Project did start severa| days ago and it is anticitaped that this wi|| be comp|ete some time in the next coup|e of days.  Peter Sanders notes “ The completion and tie in of the West Lock project has ran into numerous delays, however, this well wi|l be tied in and the company wi|l be sel|ing gas by next week thus generating cash flow for the company” The company will update its shareho|ders when it has heard from its partner in regards to completion.
Will MOGI explode higher as more and more investors become aware of the
stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait unti| it is too late.
Remember, timing your trade is critica|.
Good Luck and Successfu| Trading.
