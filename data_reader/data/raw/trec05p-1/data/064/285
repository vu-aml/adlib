YOURS IN SERVICE,
JOHN KELLY(FOR THE CHAMBERS AND FAMILY)
From: John Kelly Esq
Email: barrjohnkelly@tsamail.co.za
Dear Sir,

PROVISION OF BANK ACCOUNT TO DEPOSIT FUNDS.

I am Barrister John Kelly, Principal partner of John & Kelly Associates and attorney to Engr.St. Micheals Idioma a Director and Award Committee officer with the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation based in Warri, Delta State.

In November 2002, my client received gratification of Eighteen Million U.SDollars($18,000,000.00) from the contract awarded to foreign firms for the construction and maintenance of 250 Million (LPG) Gas Plant at Warri Refinery, but for the civil service laws brought about by the resent government barring civil servants from operating foreign accounts and receiving gratifications after assets declaration. If detected it will amount to corruption while in service hence asking that you provide your details for processing with NNPC, thereafter orwarding it to the Custodian of the fund for a direct claim as the contractor.

Hence the fund is under the custody of Security Company/Equity Company for safe keeping. I have been mandated by my client (Engr.St. Micheals Idioma) to seek assistance of a trustworthy foreign company or an individual who could help to provide bank account to receive the money for investment without any hitch.

However, my client has agreed to an open discussion for benefits should you accept being the claimant Therefore, if this request meets with your due approval. Please forward your contact details for commencement with details briefing.

I look forward to haring from you soon.

Best regards.
BARR JOHN KELLY Esq
