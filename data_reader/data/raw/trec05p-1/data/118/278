Can you guys check this out?  Constellation is an important counterparty and we want to get them an answer pretty soon.   Im sure you guys are correct,  but if you can provide  some detail about their trader name,  etc.  that would be helpful.

Thanks

JMF, 

Constellation is disputing this sale we show to them in EnPower as well as the Hourly P&L.  I have nothing to give them for support, can you help me out or at least pass this along to whomever did the deal?

10/11/01 HE 23 50 mw @ $17 

Thanks, 
MJ
