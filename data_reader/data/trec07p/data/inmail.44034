the article: 'Tele Atlas, a Boston-based company that provides digital

Rob wrote with a link to a Computer Business Review online article, which
reports that Microsoft chairman [0]Bill Gates and Apple chief Steve Jobs
will make a joint appearance at a future technologies conference in
Carlsbad, California. The event is expected to last a little more than an
hour, and the two computer industry magnates are expected to reflect on
their pasts - while theorizing on the future. "[WSJ Tech columnist] Walt
Mossberg, a co-producer of the conference who will interview the execs
on-stage along with colleague Kara Swisher, said they simply invited
Gates and Jobs to do the interview ... [Mossberg] declined to give any
color about the questions he and Swisher are preparing, or any additional
information. Most likely, Gates and Jobs will use the occasion to do some
friendly sparring on their polar-opposite philosophies on personal
computing. Jobs may bang on about the benefits of a software-hardware
approach, while Gates may rattle off the joys of partnering with hardware
partners."

[0]jombeewoof alerted us to a story that went past unnoticed last
weekend. A new [1]industry-backed 'Copyright Alliance' was formed in the
city of Washington, DC. Tasked with the nebulous goal of 'promoting the
value of copyright as an agent for creativity, jobs, and growth', the
ultimate goal of the organization is to strengthen copyright laws
overall. "Backed by organizations like the MPAA, NBC, News Corp., Disney,
Time Warner, the Business Software Alliance, Microsoft, ASCAP, the NBA,
and others, the Copyright Alliance has already secured initial support
from several members of Congress ... The group is headed by Patrick Ross,
a former senior fellow at the Progress & Freedom Foundation, a strongly
free-market think tank. Ross has written about IP issues for years, and
in a 2005 opinion piece claimed that he was 'looking for anyone who wants
to join me in seeking that elusive middle ground.' His new gig may be a
strange place to fight for that 'middle ground' in any meaningful sense,
as the Alliance is dedicated to 'strengthening copyright law' using
'bilateral, regional, and multilateral agreements to protect creators'
and advancing educational programs 'that teach the value of strong
copyright.'"

Jaidan writes "According to a Gamespot article, a California-based
company named Target Technology is [0]suing Sony over patents it
allegedly holds for silver based reflective surfaces. The suit claims
that products marketed under the Blu-ray name infringe on a patent it
owns for reflective layer materials in optical discs. Target is seeking a
permanent injunction preventing Sony from violating its patent rights in
the future, as well as damages with interest, multiplied due to what it
characterizes as deliberate and willful infringement. ' The patent
addresses what Target called a need for specific types of silver-based
alloys with the advantages (but not the price) of gold. According to the
patent, the alloys are also more resistant to corrosion than pure silver.
Target does not specify in its suit whether it believes all of Sony's
Blu-ray discs infringe on its patent, or the suit applies to just a
portion of the discs manufactured. The patent was filed in April of 2004
and granted in March of 2006.'"

incidents, some cited in the article, where [2]the flow of email is just
too much to keep up. 'If there is a downside to completely turning a back
on e-mail, it's not one many former users notice. Stanford computer
science professor Donald E. Knuth started using e-mail in 1975 and
stopped using it 15 years later. Knuth said he prefers to concentrate on
writing books rather than be distracted by the steady stream of
communication.' Is email just too hectic a communication form for some
people? Is email dead?"

[0]Kurtz'sKompund writes "Mozilla has announced that Firefox 3.0 has
passed a major milestone! The [1]Places feature has been added to the
alpha client slated for release next week. Places is a complete re-work
of the bookmarking and history browser functions. It was at one point
slated for Firefox 2.0, but will instead see release in Mozilla's next
major version. '"We enabled the Places implementation of bookmarks on the
trunk," said the Places team in [2]a post to the Mozilla developer center
blog. "Although there is still much to be done, this is an important
milestone for us." Firefox 3.0 alpha 5 is scheduled to launch June 1.
Because Places uses the open-source SQLite database engine to store and
retrieve bookmarks and history entries, it's incompatible with earlier
Firefox editions' bookmarks. Alpha users must convert their existing
entries, Mozilla developers said."

[0]Chandon Seldon writes "Contrary to many [1]earlier reports, it turns
out that Dell's prices for its Ubuntu PCs [2]are cheaper than similar
Windows Vista PCs for all three Models. Ars Technica reports: 'So it
turns out that not including Windows saves the consumer $50 from the
regular list price. This amount is not too far off from what a large OEM
like Dell would pay for a volume discount for Windows Vista Home Basic
(the regular OEM price is about $95). Many value PC sellers try to make
up for the cost of a Windows license by bundling demo and trial versions
of software such as AOL (affectionately known as "crapware"), for which
they receive money from software companies looking to increase their
distribution levels. Dell is no exception to this practice, although on
their web site it allows customers to select the option of not including
various applications.' For direct comparisons, Nat Tuck of Umass-Lowell
has put together [3]a simple page showing prices for Ubuntu and
Windows-based PCs."

or is a joke to boost employee morale is anyone's guess, and naturally no
one at Microsoft was available for comment. From what can be seen in the
photo, only a few early-model iPods have been deposited."

An anonymous reader writes "The CSS protection used in DVDs has been
[0]ruled "ineffective" by Helsinki District Court. This means that CSS is
not covered by the Finnish copyright law amendment of 2005 (based on
[1]EU Copyright Directive from 2001), allowing it to be freely
circumvented. Quoting the press release: ' The conclusions of the court
can be applied all over Europe since the word effective comes directly
from the directive ... A protection measure is no longer effective, when
there is widely available end-user software implementing a circumvention
method. My understanding is that this is not technology-dependent. The
decision can therefore be applied to Blu-Ray and HD-DVD as well in the
future.'"

An anonymous reader writes "Connecticut's Attorney General Richard
Blumenthal has [0]accused Best Buy of overcharging its customers. His
accusation is that customers see one price on Best Buy's website, in
stores salespeople would show them a different internal site from a
kiosk. Best Buy denies the charges. 'Previously, the company confirmed
that store employees have access to an internal Web site that looks
nearly identical to the public BestBuy.com site, but the company's policy
is always to offer customers the lowest quoted price unless it's
specifically identified as a deal available only to online shoppers.
Jerry Farrell Jr., Connecticut's consumer protection commissioner, said
the lawsuit should be a warning to companies to be more transparent in
their business practices.'"

An anonymous reader writes "The BBC reports on a proposal to [0]use RFID
and wi-fi to track students wherever they go on campus: 'Battery-powered
RFID tags are placed on an asset and they communicate with at least three
wireless access points inside the network to triangulate a location.' At
The Wireless Event in London, 'Marcus Birkl, head of wireless at Siemens,
said location tracking of assets or people was one of the biggest
incentives for companies, hospitals and education institutions to roll
out wi-fi networks.' The article points out that integration of RFID and
wi-fi raises the possibility that RFID can be used for remote
surveillance."

[0]Esther Schindler writes "Database decisions are never easy, even — or
maybe especially — when one choice is extremely popular. To highlight the
advantages and disadvantages of the open-source MySQL DBMS, CIO.com asked
two open-source experts to enumerate the reasons to choose MySQL and to
pick something else. Tina Gasperson takes the [1]5 reasons to use MySQL
side, and Brent Toderash discusses [2]8 reasons not to. Note that this
isn't an 'open source vs proprietary databases' comparison; it's about
MySQL's suitability in enterprise situations."

[0]Mike writes "Sony Corporation has put online a video of their [1]new
flexible 2.5 inch display. The display can be bent in half, is full
color, and is apparently relatively inexpensive to make. This could be
used in hundreds of cool new products, as well as enhancing thousands of
existing products. In fact, it's hard to see where this kind of display
wouldn't be used, especially in portable consumer electronics. 'The
display combines Sony's organic thin film transistor, or TFT, technology,
which is required to make flexible displays, with another kind of
technology called organic electroluminescent display, it said. The latter
technology is not as widespread for gadgets as the two main display
technologies now on the market - liquid crystal displays and plasma
display panels. Although flat-panel TVs are getting slimmer, a display
that's so thin it bends in a human hand marks a breakthrough ... "In the
future, it could get wrapped around a lamppost or a person's wrist, even
worn as clothing," said Sony spokesman Chisato Kitsukawa. "Perhaps it can
be put up like wallpaper."'"

[0]the_quiet_angeleno writes "I have an article in today's Summer Film
Preview issue of Los Angeles CityBeat on Disney's sci-fi classic Tron,
which is [1]celebrating it's 25th anniversary this year. The piece
includes a discussion with Richard Taylor, one of Tron's visual effects
supervisors on the film's groundbreaking effects, as well as director
Steven Lisberger, on how the narrative incorporates the Jungian concept
of individuation. Here's a sample: 'Visual Effects Society member Gene
Kozicki, of the L.A.-based visual effects house Rhythm & Hues, believes
Tron's legacy was in moving computer-generated visuals into the realm of
storytelling. "Research into this type of imagery had been going on for
over 15 years, but it was more scientific in nature," Kozicki says, "Once
artists began to share their ideas and treat the computer as a tool, it
moved away from strict research and towards an art form."
