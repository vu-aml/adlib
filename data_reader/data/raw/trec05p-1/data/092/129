If you have not gone into the Master Workplan in Excel (o:\corporate\tax\master workplan post september close) to update the ranking of your companies, please do so before noon tomorrow.  Please update the company assignment information, for any entities that have recently been assigned to you.  If you have any questions regarding the ranking of your entities, please discuss them with your supervisor.

Thank you,
  Caroline

Everyone:

There are still approximately 300 unranked entities.  These entities need to be ranked by noon tomorrow.  All entities that are still unranked after tomorrow will automatically be assigned a ranking level of "4".

Since, this will ultimately affect resources allocated to your groups, it would be in everybody's best interest to assign the proper rankings to the Master Workplan at this time.

It would also be a good idea to make sure the preparers/reviewers are assigned, since there are still many empty fields.  Don't forget to update TIS entity maintenance fields to match the workplan data.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,
