Lynn,

I sent this request for payment to Delaine in June.  I followed up (via an e-mail I can't find) in July.  Delaine replied to my July follow-up saying she was having trouble getting a hold of someone (internally) she needed to talk with.  I really would appreciate your calling her!

Delaine,

The Operating Agreement between Northern and KN (now Oneok) entitles
Oneok to all condensate and drip liquids removed from any of the
Northern pipelines, equipment or facilities upstream of Oneok's Bushton
Plant.  That agreement also provides that Oneok will be responsible for
picking-up, hauling and providing a detailed accounting of such liquids
removed.  In addition Oneok is to pay Northern for the shrinkage
attributable to such condensate and drip.  Northern invoices Oneok
monthly for a cash reimbursement of the mmbtu's attributable to the
condensate removed.

Effective April 2000, Oneok began short paying its invoices.  The table
below summarizes the amount shorted through April 2001 as $67, 889.36.
This short payment reflects Oneok's refusal to reimburse Northern for
removal of condensate attributable to the Mount Jesus Drip, lease #
71176.  Oneok has indicated to Northern that Oneok's contract hauler
contends the liquid removed from Northern's system at this point is
water.  In spite of evidence provided by Northern to the contrary, Oneok
accepts its contractor's contention, apparently pays a disposal fee, and
refuses to reimburse Northern for the mmbtu's lost.

This location produced condensate prior to the March 31, 1997 agreement
and no change to Northern's pipeline operations that would impact
condensation dropout has occurred.  Oneok was properly reimbursing
Northern prior to April 2000.  In addition, the attached analysis of
liquid removed from the location on September 20, 2000, demonstrates
that hydrocarbon condensate continues to be collected at the drip.
Northern must insist that compensation for these BTU's removed from
Northern's System be made by Oneok.  Your immediate attention to this
matter is appreciated.

Thanks
