MISSOURI COURT STRIKES DOWN ST. LOUIS LIVING WAGE ORDINANCE

In what may be the first judicial decision overturning a
living wage law, the Missouri Circuit Court strikes down a
living wage ordinance approved by voters in St. Louis last
year ("Missouri Hotel and Motel Ass'n v. St. Louis, "Mo.
Cir. Ct., No. 004-02638, 7/18/01). Finding that several
portions of the ordinance are illegal or "unconstitutionally
vague," Judge Dierker permanently enjoins the city from
implementing or enforcing the ordinance.

Dierker finds that the ordinance conflicts with a state
minimum wage statute by attempting to apply living wage
standards to contractors, subcontractors, and lessees of
grantholders "regardless of whether they derive any benefit
from the [C]ity" in the form of financial assistance,
regardless of whether they play a role in the economic
development contemplated by the assistance, and without
regard to time. The ordinance, approved by voters in August
2000, required city contractors, their subcontractors,
leaseholders, and companies receiving tax breaks or
assistance from the city to pay their employees a living
wage starting at $8.67 an hour with health care benefits or
$9.92 an hour without health care benefits. . . . Page AA-1,

COURT SAYS LOWER JOB RATING'S TIE TO BONUS PROVIDES BASIS
FOR BIAS SUIT

An analyst for the Department of Veterans Affairs may
proceed with her claim that the federal agency violated
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act by discriminatorily
giving her an "excellent" performance rating rather than an
"outstanding" rating, which resulted in a lower bonus, the
D.C. Circuit rules ("Russell v. Principi,  "D.C. Cir.,  No.
00-5172,  7/27/01).

Reversing summary judgment for the department in the reverse
discrimination lawsuit brought by Lisa K. Russell, the court
rejects the department's argument that Russell's case was
shut down by the appeals court's 1999 ruling in "Brown v.
Brody" that poor performance evaluations were not
necessarily adverse job actions. Here, the court finds, the
performance evaluation could be considered an adverse job
action because it was directly tied to Russell's job bonus.

CHAO PROMISES REVIEW OF YOUTH OPPORTUNITY GRANTS

Labor Secretary Elaine Chao says the Labor Department will
review job training programs that are funded annually
through DOL's Youth Opportunity Grants before authorizing a
third round of funding in 2002. Speaking before the National
Urban League, Chao says that during her review she will look
for a "serious educational component to these programs, not
just dead-end diversions to make people feel better."

In June, DOL gave $202 million in youth opportunity grants
to 35 communities for job training and education programs
targeted at youths who run the greatest risk of permanent
joblessness. The grants are the second installment of a
five-year, $1.375 billion effort.

Chao also highlights a recent partnership formed in June
between DOL and the Education Department. Under a memorandum
of understanding signed by Chao and Education Secretary
Paige, DOL will take primary responsibility for the core
programs involved in the initiative--the Job Corps program
and the One-Stop Career Center system--while the Education
Department will provide guidance on adult math and reading
skills and explore high school degree options. . . . Page

AK STEEL, STEELWORKERS SET TO RESUME TALKS TO RESOLVE
TWO-YEAR DISPUTE

Although allegations of inappropriate conduct continue,
representatives of the United Steelworkers and AK Steel
agree to meet at the bargaining table Aug. 2, looking to
resolve a labor dispute at the company's Mansfield, Ohio,
plant before its second anniversary.

About 620 workers represented by USW Local 169 were locked
out of the plant Sept. 1, 1999, when the most recent
contract expired. AK Steel, which acquired the plant from
Armco later that month, has continued to operate the plant
with management employees and replacement workers.

USW representative Tony Montana says the scheduled talks
will mark the second meeting in a month. Negotiations
between the union and AK Steel resumed July 12 after a
six-month bargaining hiatus.  Neither side would comment on
the substance or tenor of their talks. Original negotiations
broke down largely over the issue of mandatory overtime,
Montana says. . . . Page A-5

PLAINTIFF AWARDED NOMINAL DAMAGES MIGHT RECEIVE ATTORNEYS'
FEES

A race discrimination plaintiff who recovered only nominal
damages of a dollar on his harassment claim may nevertheless
be entitled to attorneys' fees, provided he meets the
criteria set out in a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court opinion, the
Tenth Circuit rules ("Barber v. Williamson, " 10th Cir., No.
00-5015, 7/2/01).

A federal magistrate judge grants plaintiff Lenard Barber's
request for attorneys' fees after a jury found in Barber's
favor on his hostile environment racial harassment claim
under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The jury,
however, rejected Barber's additional claims of
discriminatory termination and retaliatory discharge. It
also finds that Barber "suffered no damages" from the
racially hostile work environment, awarding $1 as a
vindication of the plaintiff's Title VII rights.

In awarding attorneys' fees to Barber, the federal
magistrate cites the "general rule" under Title VII that
attorneys' fees are to be awarded to "prevailing parties"
absent "circumstances that would make such an award unjust"
as well as Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's concurring opinion
in "Farrar v. Hobby".

On remand, the district court should reconsider its
attorneys' fee award to Barber in light of the Tenth
Circuit's clarification of the O'Connor criteria, the
magistrate concludes. . . . Page A-3
