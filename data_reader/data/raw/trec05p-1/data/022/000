We will put this on the agenda.  Is there anything else you would like on
the agenda?

Please keep your eyes peeled for the email that will come this afternoon
with the meeting location and other details.

Greetings Tracy:

It's becoming increasing clear that the PUC is more than likely--unless
persuaded otherwise--to suspend DA under AB1X now that the Legislature
has failed to pass a comprehensive bill.

We have a proposal on how the CPUC can keep Direct Access in place while
satisfying the concerns of the Treasurer, etc.  We'd like to:

1) present it to the group tomorrow.
2) try to get the group's support for the proposal.
3) if we get support, submit the proposal to the PUC (as a group) by
Friday.

Can we get 15-30 minutes on tomorrow's agenda to discuss?  Thanks very
much.

Best,
Jeff
