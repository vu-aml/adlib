Scrubbers Planned For Four TVA Coal Plants

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) recently unveiled plans to cut SO2 emissions by equipping four of its
coal-fired generating facilities with flue-gas desulfurization systems. The $1.5 billion project will add
single scrubbers at TVA's Bull Run, Paradise, and Colbert plants, and a pair of scrubbers at the utility's Kingston
facility. Equipping the five units with sulfur controls is expected to lower TVA's SO2 emissions by 200,000 tons per year, the utility said.

TVA is also in the midst of a $1 billion program to reduce NOX emissions at its plants by constructing 18 selective-catalytic-reduction systems (SCRs) on 25 coal-fired generating units.  Design work on the new scrubbers will start in 2003. Peak construction activities will have to be delayed, however, until the SCR-installation program is finished. The utility noted that a lack of availability of craft workers and other resources needed to install the emissions-control equipment will affect the completion date (AD 7/18/01). TVA didn't provide an estimated completion date for the scrubber project.

TVA has already installed scrubbers on six of its coal-fired generating units, including two each at Cumberland,
Paradise and Widows Creek.
