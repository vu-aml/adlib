Eric,

I appreciate the interest but I already have plans with a friend of mine. Should he cancel his party, I'm definitely in. Also, I really appreciate lunch last week. You da man

I was thinking of having a get together at my place but I wanted to gauge interest first.  Let me know if you are interested.  I will send out another e-mail if I get enough responses.
