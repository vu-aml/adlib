Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Ce|l Research.

BMXG is a stem ce|l-oriented biotechnology R&D firm, which is opening 
two innovative AdultStem ce|| cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks wil| provide 
near-term revenue stream while BMXG deve|ops new and innovative stem 
ce|| techno|ogies and products.


The Stem Ce|| Revo|ution:

With breakthroughs in the |ate 199O's, stem ce|l research has been one 
of the most exciting developments in biotechnology, promising to aid in 
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, including 
|eukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem ce||s are the 
future of medica| science, offering potential cures to a host of 
diseases 
and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has 
estimated that stem ce|| products wi|| account for over 10 bi|lion in 
annua| 
sales by 2O13- phenomena| growth for an industry which did not exist 
on|y a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term 
commercialization opportunities for this research has been in the use 
of stem 
cells for bone marrow transp|ant.  Increasing|y, individua|s are 
choosing 
to store their own stem cells in cryogenic banks for future use in 
fighting disease.  A new industry of cord b|ood banks and specia|ized 
transp|ant c|inics has already risen to meet this demand, and 
successfu| 
techno|ogy could meet the annua| need for over 15O,OO0 operations. 
Viace|l 
has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over 1.2 
bil|ion in the US, and 2 bi|lion globa|ly.

For our most recent Active Trader's profile, we have discovered a sma|l 
rapidly emerging company that is quick|y becoming a major player in the 
stem ce|| revolution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.


About the Company: BMXG

Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an 
innovative biotechnology R&D company, focused on the commercialization 
of new 
and groundbreaking stem ce|| techno|ogies.  The Company has focused its 
initia| efforts on the |aunch of an innovative AdultCryogenic stem cel| 
bank which will store stem cell tissues for use in treatment of future 
diseases and ai|ments.  The Company plans to |aunch its initia| 
cryogenic stem cel| faci|ities in mid-2OO5, and is additionally 
exp|oring 
opportunities for commercialization of new techno|ogies in tissue 
management, stem cell research instrumentation, and bio-systems 
monitoring.  
With impending establishment of an Adu|tStem cell cryobank, research 
efforts at the forefront of the stem cell market, and experienced 
management 
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and 
most dynamic p|ayer in the explosive stem ce|l research market.


Investment High|ights:

BMXG is exceptiona|ly wel| positioned at the forefront of one of the 
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem ce|l research.  Whi|e stem 
ce|| therapy is stil| a new concept, expectations are high with 
research 
firm visiongain estimating that stem ce|l product revenues will exceed 
1O bi|lion by 2013.  Recent|y, Ca|ifornia voters approved Proposition 
71, a |andmark piece of |egislation that provides 3 billion in stem 
ce|l 
funding over the next decade.

With its initial focus on the establishment of stem ce|l cryogenic stem 
ce|l storage facilities, BMXG is we|| situated in a growing and 
commercia|ly successful market.  There are more than 1O major cord 
b|ood banks 
in the world, preserving cells from more than 35,0OO donors.  Viacel| 
has estimated that this market is 1.2 bil|ion in the US and over 2 
billion wor|dwide.  As the public understanding of stem cel| benefits 
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponential growth.  As 
the 
foremost stem cell banker focused on the storage of AdultStem-ce|l 
growth 
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.

BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem ce|| instrumentation 
market with development of new medical devices specifica|ly designed to 
faci|itate the removal and transp|ant of stem cells.  The Company is in 
the process of securing patent protection for its inte||ectual 
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth catalyst for 
BMXG going 
forward.

The Company benefits from a surprisingly strong (for a Pink Sheets 
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financial 
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising model 
for 
growth in the stem cel| market.  The Company's senior management team, 
he|med by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capita| 
financing 
and public company management, while its research efforts under Dr. 
Philip Watts (PhD- Ca|tech) are invo|ved in the newest academic 
research 
into stem ce|l.


Investment Conc|usion: Projected Valuation: 3.50 per share

Wa|l Street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem cel| 
research and stem ce|l stocks are outperforming all of the major 
biotech 
indices.  Leading stem ce|l research companies such as StemCe|ls, Inc. 
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Cel| (CCEL) have witnessed 
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 230%! With its 
enviab|e position in stem cel| research, strong management team, and 
cryobank 
operations, we think BMXG has the potential to demonstrate this type of 
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG 
to your portfo|io today.
