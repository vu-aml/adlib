LUTE'S "DOUR ASSESSMENT": President Bush's nominee to be war czar said yesterday that conditions in Iraq have not
improved significantly despite the influx of U.S. troops in recent months and predicted that, absent major political
reform, violence will continue to rage over the next year. Lt. Gen. Spielas E. Lute, tapped by Bush to serve as a new
high-powered White House coordinator of the war, told senators at a confirmation hearing that Iraqi factions "have
shown so far very little progress" toward the reconciliation necessary to stem the bloodshed. If that does not change,
he said, "we're not likely to see much difference in the security situation" a year from now. Washington Post: Nominee
to Coordinate War Offers Grim Forecast on Iraq
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/07/AR2007060702533.html

HOUSE PASSES STEM CELL BILL, BUSH RENEWS VETO THREAT: The House gave final Congressional approval on Thursday to
legislation aimed at easing restrictions on federal financing of embryonic stem cell research, but Democratic leaders
in both chambers conceded they were short of the votes needed to override a veto threatened by President Bush. On a
vote of 247 to 176, the House overwhelmingly passed the bill, with more than three dozen Republicans joining a
Democratic-led effort to authorize federal support for research using stem cells from spare embryos that fertility
clinics would otherwise discard. The Senate approved the legislation in April... [M]inutes after the vote, Mr. Bush
renewed his pledge to veto the proposal, which he called "a recycled old bill." New York Times: House Votes to Expand
Stem Cell Research http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/08/washington/08stem.html

BUSH APPROVAL AT 32 PERCENT; MATCHES ALL-TIME LOW IN AP-IPSOS: Public approval of the job President Bush is doing now
matches its all-time low, an AP-Ipsos poll says. The survey, released Thursday, reflects widespread discontent over how
Bush is handling the war in Iraq, efforts against terrorism and domestic issues. It also underscores challenges
Republican presidential and congressional candidates will confront next year when they face voters who seem to be
clamoring for change. Only 32 percent said they were satisfied with how Bush is handling his job overall, the same low
point AP-Ipsos polling measured last January and a drop of 3 percentage points since May. Bush still wins approval from
seven in 10 Republicans, though that is near his historic low for GOP support of 67 percent in January. AP via Yahoo!

PRESIDENT TO MEET POPE BENEDICT: When Al Smith lost the 1928 presidential race, he was attacked for being Roman
Catholic and therefore too close to the pope. Today, U.S. presidents and the leader of the Catholic Church enjoy a
working relationship that has spanned decades. President Bush has his fourth papal audience on Saturday and his first
with Pope Benedict XVI. Bush will tie a meeting record set by presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, who both met
four times with Pope John Paul II. Bush told a group of European journalists last week that he is looking forward to
meeting with Benedict, calling him a "a good thinker and a smart man. I'll be in a listening mode. "Sometimes I'm not
poetic enough to describe what it's like to be in the presence of the Holy Father," Bush said. "It is a moving
experience." USA Today: Benedict, Bush both benefit from meeting

WILL DEMS SUBPOENA NSA DOCS? Senior House Democrats threatened Thursday to issue subpoenas to obtain secret legal
opinions and other documents from the Justice Department related to the National Security Agency's domestic wiretapping
program. If the Democrats take that step, it would mark the most aggressive action yet by Congress in its oversight of
the wiretapping program and could set the stage for a constitutional showdown over the separation of powers. The
subpoena threat came after a senior Justice Department official told a House judiciary subcommittee on Thursday that
the department would not turn over the documents because of their confidential nature. New York Times: Democrats May
Subpoena N.S.A. Documents http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/08/washington/08nsa.html

WORKING WITH KENNEDY "DAMAGING" FOR McCAIN, GRAHAM: An immigration alliance with Democratic Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts is damaging Arizona Sen. John McCain and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham among conservative
Republicans. The damage to the two Republican senators caused by their support for Mr. Kennedy's immigration bill --
which was blocked by a Senate filibuster last night -- is especially clear in Mr. Graham's home state, scene of an
early presidential primary next year. "I'm very wary of a Republican who is talking to Ted Kennedy," Rick Beltram,
Republican Party chairman for Spartanburg County, S.C., told The Washington Times yesterday, after it was reported that
Mr. Graham and Mr. McCain had first checked with Mr. Kennedy before deciding to vote with the Massachusetts Democrat on
an amendment to the Senate bill. Washington Times: Kennedy alliance costly to GOP senators

"DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL" BACK IN THE NEWS: The presidential candidates are dividing starkly along party lines on one of
the signature fights of the 1990s: whether the 14-year-old policy of "don't ask, don't tell" should be repealed and gay
men and lesbians allowed to serve openly in the military. In back-to-back debates in New Hampshire this week, every
Democratic candidate raised his or her hand in support of repealing that policy, while not a single Republican embraced
the idea. Democrats argued with striking unanimity that it was time to end the uneasy compromise that President Bill
Clinton reached in 1993, after his attempt to lift the ban on gay men and lesbians in the military provoked one of the
most wrenching fights of his young administration. New York Times: For 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,' Split on Party Lines
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/08/us/politics/08gays.html

GIULIANI HAS THE MOST LOBBYIST BUNDLERS: Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani may be running for the GOP
presidential nomination as a Washington outsider, but you'd never know it from the list of lobbyist insiders raising
money for him. Giuliani has collected more lobbyist bundlers -- 20 -- than any other major candidate who is accepting
help from the community. He beat Republican challenger Sen. John McCain's number of 12 and, on the Democratic side,
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's half-dozen lobbyist helpers. While Giuliani clocks in with more hands on deck, that
hasn't translated into more money. Clinton still leads in that category, pulling in $234,550 to Giuliani's $100,950,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The Politico: Giuliani's cache boasts big names

FRED THOMPSON... MOST DANGEROUS TO McCAIN? [Fred] Thompson's candidacy appears to present the most challenges for
[John] McCain. One of only three senators to endorse his candidacy when the lawmaker from Arizona sought the presidency
in 2000, Thompson has been basking in media attention even as McCain has been the subject of attacks from the party
base on the compromise immigration legislation he helped shape. Though the two shared remarkably similar voting records
in the Senate, Thompson has assailed the immigration bill, which many Republicans dislike. He has also worked hard to
convince social conservatives, who remain suspicious of McCain, that he is strongly against abortion. Washington Post:
Defections to Fred Thompson Pose a Major Threat to McCain
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/07/AR2007060702535.html

OBAMA GIVES AWAY CASH FROM BUSINESSMEN WITH REZKO TIES: U.S. Sen. Barack Obama is giving charities some $16,500 in
campaign donations from two Chicago businessmen who had financial ties to indicted dealmaker Antoin "Tony" Rezko. A
spokesman for Obama's presidential campaign on Thursday offered no details about Obama's relationship with the two
contributors. But the announcement puts an unwanted spotlight on the two local businessmen and underscores Obama's
efforts to distance himself from Rezko, a former friend and fundraiser who has become a public relations problem for
Obama's presidential campaign. Rezko has pleaded not guilty to federal influence peddling and bank fraud charges.

PUNCHES THROWN ON AL SENATE FLOOR: As images of a state senator punching another on the Senate floor on the final day
of the session were broadcast across the state and the world, several senators agreed to an obvious understatement --
things have got to change next year. They agreed legislation should be passed. They agreed both sides must respect one
another. But they both disagreed on how that happens. "Unless they change, things won't change," said Senate Republican
leader Jabo Waggoner of Vestavia Hills. Waggoner was referring to the Democratic majority in the Senate that he
believes is trying to shut a group of Republicans and some Democrats out of the legislative process. Montgomery

NEED A JOB?  HIT THE TRAIL: Job prospects for college graduates are looking up thanks to the 2008 presidential
candidates. Eighteen contenders — and counting — translate into plenty of hiring by the campaigns of promising but
untested newcomers, especially in states with early nominating contests. In South Carolina, Lauren Manning is taking a
break from law school to work as Democratic Sen. Barack Obama's jack-of-all trades, earning about $2,300 a month. Her
office walls are bare, and her title remains a work in progress. "They haven't settled on that yet," said Manning, 26,
who sharpened her skills with one of South Carolina's best-read blogs. "I'm doing a little bit of everything. Politics,
communications, kind of liaison on policy — that sort of thing." AP via Yahoo! News: Campaigns mean jobs for college
grads http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070608/ap_on_el_pr/campaign_hires
