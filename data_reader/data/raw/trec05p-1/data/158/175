Bill,

	To complete the information I provided to you yesterday, the name of the electric utility providing electric service to Transwestern's Bloomfield, New Mexico compressor station is: The City of Farmington Electric Department.

	In addition, although not required for a Transwestern bankruptcy filing, the name of the electric utility providing electric service to Northern Natural's Hubbard, Iowa compressor station is: Midland Power Cooperative.
