Dear All:

The following program details have been reviewed/approved by our legal team and has been distributed to all our US employees to kick off the Metals NA Voluntary Separation Program.  We are still finalizing legal due diligence to determine if a similar voluntary program can be rolled out in Montreal and should have an answer on this shortly.

Also attached for your reference is the Plan Document for the Voluntary Separation Program.  This will be circulated for signatures in the next two days. 

Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Regards,
Cathy
