All the many neighbors in the energy industry appreciate
this further utilitization of gas resources!  Ah, the
wonders of hydrocarbons.

My question for Nathalie is : how long did it take you to
count the 20,000 mosquito carcasses?

My request for Gayle is: please keep away from our house as
we do not need a mosquito magnet drawing them over to our
place.

In honesty though, the mosquitos were really bad when it was
wet out but I haven't seen one in weeks.  Maybe the problem
is just people opening doors and windows to the cooler
weather and letting them in the house.  Time to check those
screens!
